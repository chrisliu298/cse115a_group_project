<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  it was ok, the actual food was pretty good. the naan was nice, the seasoning on both of our dishes was very savory, however be warned medium is very very mild, that was our fault not there's.  My problem laid with the service and staff, the ambiance and the loud music.  The staff was grumpy the music was loud bollywood which i think was only on for the staff and yah, i just dont know.  I think as a takeout it would be ok.   it is probably actually a 2.5 but more of a two reaching for a three than a three sliding.    food itself was probably a 3.5 <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 3 foodies, spent ~$320 (including tip) - expensive but delicious!\nOur menu - \n1 bottle of wine - Honig Cab Sav for $70\n1 glass of wine - same as above\n1 order corn soup - amazing and our favorite, must must try\n1 beet salad\n1 tagliatelle pasta - also super yummy\n1 scallop dish with quinoa, polenta, refreshing delicious sauce\n1 grouper with crab marscapone and tomoatos\n1 pounded pork chop with marsala wine reduction (fav main of the 3)\n1 chocolate peanut butter cake with side of vanilla bean icecream\n\nGreat service and every dish is yum, with some dishes extraordinary from a foodie perspective. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I like this place. So far I have tried the hummus and the falafel, it was good. I  lived in Israel, so I have eaten my fair share of middle eastern cuisine. The only feedback I have is that the store looks a bit dirty. I think that could be a turnoff to some.... I think they could do a few things to freshen the place up and make it known they serve food, I think they would get more business this way, and people would not miss out on the great middle eastern cuisine. The man at the front desk is very kind as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went here tonight, will never be back.\n\nThe food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.\n\nJust an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.) \n\nThe most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a \""sports bar\"" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up. \n\nNot only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.\n\nId like to be able to say \""Oh it was a busy night I understand.\"" But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn't have \""To go cups\"" and rolled her eyes.\n\nThis place obviously doesn't work as a team, and it shows..\nNever mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, I would love to have tried this wonderful food that I read about in the reviews, but I guess I never will.  King Solomon's Pizza lost my business on the first try by playing a game I absolutely cannot stand.\n\nI ordered my pizza over the phone. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast.  As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said \""Don't you need my name and number?\"". He replied that it wasn't necessary. That should have clued me in.\n\nSo, I drive over to pick up my pizza.  I walk in and I'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter.  I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them.  One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY?\n\nSo I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there?  He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza.\n\nNice try JERKS.  I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere.\n\nApparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay. This same technique was used on me before a Chinese restaurant in west Phoenix. \n\nFool me once shame on me. Fool me twice, screw you! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  (Occurred last summer, just now updating)\n\nFound myself with very simple issue on a ~6-year old unit - exhaust fan (outside) failed.  Very disappointed in response I received from McLintock when I contacted them seeking to purchase replacement fan and install myself.  The representative insisted on $90 service call to determine issue.  Them stood behind some policy that they couldn't sell parts.  I understand to a degree but they've lost a customer due to their insistence on making a buck and lack of willingness to help or direction to solve my issue.  This highlighted how they've tried to upsell me on every visit for the past couple years - I overlooked previously because I have no issue saying 'No.'\n\nI wound up finding a replacement fan online, thru a willing merchant; installed myself and all is well for a year now. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I LOVE this pizza!  It's the best I have had in Phoenix.  Not the greatest atmosphere to sit down in.  Service is fine... but the pizza is awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Way too sweet for my liking. Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet. In my opinion, if you like sweet taste this much, might as well eat candy bar dip in corn syrup as a meal. When I ordered my food a few years back from them, they put too much food coloring so much that it looked yellow. It was not appealing to me. But it has been years I haven't been there so they could have improved and better. I sure hope that's the case. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So after an exhausting day the man and I decided we wanted to be waited on for dinner.  However we couldn't come up with a style of food we were hungry for.  Now, when this happens my boyfriend invariably reverts to his inexplicable love for TGI Fridays.  I don't really understand the infatuation.  Friday's is fine, I guess, but when there are so many other better options why bother?  Plus there isn't one remotely close to my house.  So i start rattling off other pub-ish type places in the area where he might have a similar (but better) experience.  We settled on Wally's.  I had been once before but this was his first time.\n\nWhen we walked in, the host gave us our choice of seating and we decided on a high top near the bar.  As we settled into our seats and took a look around, we agreed that the ambiance and decor are homey and welcoming without being obnoxious.  In fact, it sort of looks like a low key Friday's.  \n\nOur waiter came by promptly and took drink orders.  Wally's has a decent beer selection and the bf thought they had a nice whiskey selection as well.  We noticed how good the calamari looked as it was delivered to a nearby table and ordered that to start.  As we waited for it to arrive, we concentrated on our figuring out our entree orders.  I ultimately went with the chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu and the bf ordered the Frisco burger.  The server was accommodating and helpful, making suggestions and answering questions as needed.  He specifically mentioned that the chipotle mayo on the burger was fantastic.\n\nWhen the calamari arrived, we dug in.  The calamari well well cooked, with crispy breading and tender meat.  The marinara it was served with though was underwhelming.  We sat for a minute wondering whether to send it back or just deal.  Then, my bf said, \""I wonder how that chipotle mayo would be with the calamari?\""  Genius.  We flagged down server and he agreed that the mayo sauce was great with the calamari.  In fact, it was a  vast improvement.  They should just serve both sauces with the calamari.  Or ditch the marinara altogether.  \n\nWhen our entrees arrived, bf was pleased with the mix of onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries served with the burger.The burger was cooked to order and similar to a patty melt.  My quesadilla, while not Mexican restaurant quality, was decent for the environment.  It was tasty and I appreciated the sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa it came with.  \n\nOur server was attentive throughout the meal and checked in on us occasionally.  He offered dessert, but we were too stuffed.  Overall, we had a great experience.  I enjoy Keegan's as a neighborhood pub spot, but I like Wally's better. We'll be back for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been going to this restaurant for several years, and probably always will come back. The food is wonderful with large portions, definitely going to have left overs. Slight complaint, they are always very busy, and with the place being small it can get pretty loud and tight. Also, a lot of the staff are hard to understand, the language barrier is noticeable. Worth the drive to try it out, I highly recommend it, just get there before your starving in case there is a line! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Don't bother even driving here with any alignment issues.. They had my car for less than a min to diagnosis my issue.. Sent me on my way to place I got my tires and said Your car isn't out of alignment.  Well went to tucker tire and indeed it was out.. So got my alignment there and my car rides great!!! Thanks tucker... Jacks  place made me feel like I was a inconvenience.  Will never go there again.  4.5 stars ??? they are not... Go to Tucker Tire <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I haven't been to this location as much as I have some of the other locations but I do enjoy this location. Again they are all kind of the same in a sense but its about the interior and the experience. I actually quite like the people who work at this location. I have seen the same people working here for a while now and they always make me feel so welcome. They are usually a couple of early 30's to middle aged women working here that make ya feel like mom is welcoming you home. \""What can I get ya hun,\"" \""How's your day going sweety,\"" that kind of stuff. And some people may not like that but I enjoy it because it makes you feel way more comfortable to be somewhere. They are always fast and efficient and any extras you may want are stocked plentifully. The one small thing I don't like is that they are tucked away and really have to be looking for it to know where it is and it is sort of a small building. It can get really cramped if there is a line in there and pushed against some of the valuables. Nice place to stop after some shopping if ya know where it is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love the Phat ti. (Pad Tie)? That's how it sounds. :-P\n\nAmbient - Walls and decar are all pretty much thai inspired.  Red table cloths and golden accents all around.  Dim lighting, coozy, booths and tables.\n\nService - They are for the most part very attentive and friendly.\n\nFood - LOVE LOVE their pad ti or is Phat tai, well how ever it is spelled.  IT is DELICIOUS.  We have tried other places and its just not the same.  This is the place for Pad Tie! :-P <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could, I would not give this place even 1 star.  The man that is there all the time, who is also the owner, ruined a silk skirt of mine and tried to blame it on anything and everything but him.  It was the worst customer service I have experienced in my life and that is no exaggeration.  He has extremely poor business skills and morals.  After a very long drawn out process  I received no apology, not even once.  He did give me the money to replace the skirt after me arguing with him on numerous occasions over a span of a few weeks and having to bring my husband with me.  When I also told him I wanted my skirt back to take it somewhere else, he lied to me and told me my skirt was not there any longer.  Luckily my husband saw the skirt laying on a table in the back and pointed it out to him.  We had to argue with him further because he said it was someone else's skirt.  This skirt is very unique looking and we knew it was mine.  After a few minutes he gave it to us in a rude huff and told us to \""just go!\"".  Anybody who lies like that I prefer not to ever deal with in any circumstance.  Do not give this man your business!  There are plenty of better dry cleaners in the charlotte area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In my final meal in Pittsburgh, I finally had the closest thing to a Pittsburgh sandwich and that was the Big Ben Hot Dog with cole slaw, fries, and a cheese sauce. It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good selection at the Pima rd. location.  I'm doing the camelback location tomorrow.  Clean and well organized, good prices.  I do not consign clothes anymore with these types of stores due to bad experiences , but it doesn't stop me from shopping at them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Have to upgrade to 5 stars because this place has never changed and is still the best! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My Girlfriend had a kidney stone - this location is 100 yds from John C. Lincoln hospital. She is a tough girl and SELDOM shows pain - this kidney stone had her getting up at 2 am, didn't wake me until 5 am when she said \""Honey I think you need to take me to the hospital.\""\nShe was in severe pain. Hospital gave her Morphine and Toradol for pain. Sent her home w/ 5 prescriptions. We sat first in line at 7:55 am at drive thru waiting for them to open. I told the pharmacist \""She is having a kidney stone and needs the meds for pain as soon as possible if you could. Thank you.\""\n2 HOURS Later they call.\nI ask (after paying the $135 cash) \""Do you prioritize orders for people depending on acute pain situations.\"" \nStandard pat 'corporate clone robot' heartless insensitive answer from the first person. Pharmacist comes over (the person we had spoken with and that had 'helped' us at 8:05 btw opening 5 min late may not be a 'big deal' to them, but when you are sitting there waiting with your girlfriend having a kidney stone, those 5 minutes feel bad), I'm still polite and asking sincerely, he says \""I was the only person here this morning, I have to do them in order as we receive them, I had kids who needed antibiotics.\"" Well HIRE someone else then! Let's see antibiotics vs. Acute Pain...hmmm...could perhaps the antibiotic wait the extra hour instead of us? Does that take a 'smarter than a 5th grader' to figure out!? apparently so at least for CVS and their stellar employees.\nOK - so NO nuance of prioritizing depending on need. Got it.\nNo sensitivity to client spending money for 5 prescriptions. Got it.\nAre you listening Corporate CVS? I'm not really blaming the 'programmed robot clones' but rather upper management for not having the in sight to install some 'CARE' in their purported HealthCARE!\nWill not use CVS again. \nWalgreens here we come, we'll try anywhere else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Heard Museum is amazing.  \n\nI've only been here once, during one of their free attendance days.    Although there are some kid-oriented exhibits, teens and adults will get the most out of this museum.\n\nThe Kachina exhibit is wonderful.  All of the art is breath-taking.  The Indian school exhibit is heart-breaking.\n\nI highly recommend going to this museum at least once, especially if you live in AZ. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Completely inedible.  Some people say the price is right, but I say you get what you pay for.  I would have rather been served dog food... at least then I would have known what it was.  Servers couldn't even open bottles of wine.  I certainly wouldn't use this company. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been here several times in the last year. The food is average...kind of fast-food-like. It sits in the warmer cases, and looks \""crusty\"". The gyros are average, not as good as the ones at the South Side gyro restaurant, by any means.  The salads are from a bag of pre-chopped lettuce, and not \""fresh\"" or interesting. \n\nBut in order to enjoy the average food, you have to get past the really rude food wait staff.  The bartenders seem to be OK, the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars, and it is a \""cheap drink\"" attraction to some downtown locals. \n\nThe staff that serves the food, and takes the orders are out of this world rude. There is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers, and after having endured her, I will never, ever return. Owners should know how they are being represented at the front register. The man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious, or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect, that he is just deaf to it. \n\nGo somewhere else. It is cheap food, and you get what you pay for. I would pay twice as much, to feel like the staff gave a crap that I was there supporting their jobs. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The owner is almost always at the store and is very attentive.  He will help fill your shipping needs and engage in some light chatter. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Phoenix City Grille is a great place for family and friends. Despite the draw back of being in a strip mall, the ambiance inside is very warm and welcoming. Instantly you will get the urge to enjoy a cocktail or in my case a Martini. PCG only gets better with the food. Classic comfort foods with a little southwest twist. The Griddle Corn Cakes were fantastic. You can definitely order that appetizer as an entree. I had the green chile burger and it was delicious. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes on this menu. We will be back soon and often. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Simply the Best. When you want to impress your guests, or a business colleague, take them here? Completely safe, guarded, protected, patrolled parking lot for those of you scared to venture into unfamiliar territories. Outstanding from beginning to end. From friendly, enthusiastic welcomes, to prompt tableside attention. Delicious Margarita and Dos Equis to wash down fresh chips, and fiery salsa served in a delightful tiny gravy boat for pouring or dipping. At least 4 servers tending to your every whim from delivering food, to clearing plates. Presentation is everything and here they do it right! From spotless, immaculately clean everything, everywhere you look, to pressed slacks and dress shirts on all the servers, there is pride in everyone's performance here. The food is the Bonus! Excellent flavor, robust and tangy, complex, plentiful, fresh and filling. You want to clean your plate! Prices are more than fair and reasonable for what you get! Charming Mexico Decor throughout without being gawdy or cheesy. Nice enough to impress a date before a concert or show Downtown. Absolutely my favorite place to dine in South Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Been to Germany? If not, then go. If yes, then no. When I think of German food, I think of the smells of Frankfurt Am Main or the hip little Back Factory spots around Berlin. This place lacks something, it may be Germans. I dunno. Spend 30 bucks on 8 euros worth of food. Do the math it doesn't add up. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Let me say, this is not a store where the employees will be nice to you, ask you if you need help finding anything, or do anything at all to make you feel welcome, but it's soooo worth it.  \n\nThis dump has everything.  Piles and piles of fabric, ribbons, trim, notions, and so much various craft stuff it'll make your head spin.  Tiny pink and blue clothespins, cute little patches, bra straps, fake fur in every color of the rainbow, mini-chain by the yard, huge bins of zippers...I could go on and on.  If you make crafts you need to come to this store.  The prices are pretty good, too.  It's a magical place, complete with the angry trolls that cut your fabric and take your payment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here today for a basic oil change.  Service was good and I had no problems.  They did all of the initial \""checks\"" and whatnot and then they brought me out to go over the results.  My only issue here is that when they were recommending something, they just assumed you wanted to have it done and didn't ask.  I need a new air filter - they even brought it over to show me.  He just added it to my virtual \""cart\"" on their system.  I had to tell him that I didn't want to have it done right now.  He gave me the look like, \""What are you thinking?  This needs to be done.\""  No thanks, I'll do it myself.\n\nThe oil change was $34.95 and I had a $5 off coupon.  I was there on a Thursday and there was no $10 off deal so maybe that's a discount of the past...\n\nOverall, good times.  Minus one star for the attempted forced air filter and a waiting area that smells of urine.  Gross. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's a pain to have their prescription refilled. One out of 10 calls to Elisa (Tana Frumento's refiller), goes to voicemail and she never gets back to you! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Overly expensive\n\nOK, we live overseas so many of the foodstuffs at this place are not that exotic to us.    In any case, it does look like a nice selection of deli meats and cheeses.  Three of us had two apps and several glasses of wine apiece.  Bill came to $150.  Fairly scandalous in my view.  Wine prices even higher than Paris or London.  And your view is a surface parking lot and not the Seine.   Macarons $4 apiece.  They only cost \u20ac2 in Paris and \u20ac1 in the rest of the country.\n\nAnyway, if I lived here I doubt I'd hang here much.  There must be a lot better value for the $$$ at other wine bars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stayed here one night while in town for a job interview.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable with different pillow selections (foam, feather, hard, soft).  I appreciate having the microwave and fridge in the room when I travel in case I don't feel like going out to eat again or I'm too tired to get out.  \n\nAlso, in the lobby there are pre-printed directions to local businesses.  I didn't take advantage but there is a bar in the lobby.  Internet access was free and there was a desk in the room.  Highway access is convenient and it is close enough to bars and restaurants.\n\nThe gym is adequate and the equipment is better than most hotels, including tv screen so bring ear plugs if you want to listen.  There were not weights though and the pool is too small for laps but there is an aquatic center just a few blocks away with both ($8 a visit for non-residents).  The treadmills are sufficient for running but Uptown is completely side-walked so if you prefer running outside its 'safe' from traffic at least. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bagels:  always stick with the pumpernickel and everything bagels. Their lite cream cheese is very good. \nThe service person at the register is a CONSTANT bottleneck. I completely agree with the other reviewers who leveled similar complaints. The woman treats the cash register as if she is performing DNA analysis.\nI never ask these folks for any bagel preparation whatsoever. I simply buy a half dozen or dozen box, and then wait for the checkout blunder of the day. Today, she gave my bag of bagels to another customer and again could not properly manage checkout for either customer. \nIf you do want better service, go to the einsteins on 64th street and greenway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I visited my boyfriend for the weekend and he decided to take me out to Kamakura (may be he thought that I missed Japanese food).  It was a Saturday night and we got there at around 10 p.m.  We noticed that they are about to close and asked if they can still take us in.  They said that they can take us and we told them that we have one more friend coming.  So they sat us down and another girl came up and told us that the sushi bar already close for the night and they suppose to close in 2 minutes.  She hurried us to order from the menu and told us that the kitchen might not take anymore order if our friend did not get there in 2 minutes. (And I am not exaggerating, that was what she told us.)  I was really hungry and decided to order yakitori with yakisoba and it came with a salad and fried rice.  The food was horrible.  There was 3 sticks of skewered chicken which they tried to pass as yakitori  and cost almost $8 and the fried rice looked so horrible that I did not even touch it.  My yakisoba tasted worse than a 100 yen instant soba that I could have bought at any convenient store in Japan.  And the service was the worst thing at this place.  I am not that picky when it comes to food and especially if I am hungry, I will chow down anything.  My advice to those who are considering Kamakura, save your money, instant noodle or noodle cup taste better than the food they serve there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Generally, I don't like burgers or blue cheese but The Russell is pretty awesome combination of the two. Specifically, the blue cheese sauce is really what makes the burger awesome; you can put the sauce on anything and it will taste great. Farrens is not easily located as the entrance is down an alley. I think it is probably an attempt to keep the campus kids out and create an environment that is more for the locals, which can be nice.\n\nThe place is small but our group of five was easily able to get a table on a Thursday night. The service was pretty decent, and it didn't take long to get our food. In my opinion, the tricolor chips were better than the house fries but I am probably in the minority on that one. Overall, I think it is worthwhile to come here and try a burger with the blue cheese sauce. Next time, I will have to try the Russell with the Kobe beef patty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Every day that Richard Z is in my hood, I play emotional Russian roulette with our lunch spot. Is he gonna hate it? Is he going to order the wrong item and blame me for the rest of the day? Should we go with the tried and true. Should we try a new locally owned small business gem and raise Phoenix out of the fiery ashes of its universal assessment as the smallest of the big cities? The guy's a real Nazi about his sustenance. \n\nSo today, as we're walking to Focaccia Fiorintina, where we just should have gone to begin with, I'm like, \""OH! Do you like gyros? Your last name is Greek. Let's go to Athenian Express!\"" \n\nWell, that was stupid. I really really really hate ripping on mom and pop shops. I hate giving two star reviews to family owned restaurants. But damn... You made me look like a REAL arsehole, Athenian Express. \n\nPoor Richard Z has been lamenting about how empty he feels all afternoon. And being the people pleaser that I am, well, I'm just devastated. \n\nThe lady that took our order, no doubt a solid and very decent human being, was unwilling to play along with any banter whatsoever. For two extroverted numbskulls like us, it just takes a little bit away from the charm.\n\nAnd the spanikopita arrives... I find it too spinachy. He finds it too bready. Just goes to show you can't please everyone, or in this case anyone. \n\nMy sandwich was literally inedible. Not because of the taste. I picked it up and the whole thing fell right apart. My tray looked like a murder scene. Ketchup, who for so long suffered as the understudy in this WAY off Broadway spectacle, played the part of my disappointment. \n\nWhen I asked @spirit_fingers about his meat, he said, and I quote, \n\""It's not offensive.\"" \n\nI remember liking this place in my past life. Today, it was not good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm??? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Forgive me Aunt Chiladas! I`m so ashamed to admit that I live in your neighborhood, have been coming here forever and just now writing a review! Better late than never!\nOk what I like about this place: Best Happy Hour around- drink specials and free buffet! On Fridays they have live music and it gets packed. On beautiful weather the patio areas are great to be hanging out!\nSundays- awesome brunch with a chocolate fountain.\nMargaritas- frozen, on the rocks, top shelf, etc- love them here!\nChips and salsa- love the flaky, crispy chips here! Not a real fan of the chunky salsa( I like mine hot!) but you get two kinds- the chunky and a red mole style which is spicer so me likey!\nGrreat  place for groups!!! And the patio is dog friendly!\nFor Cinco De Mayo- come here! All day live music fest!!\nps, the inside is more intimate for dinner, I am a fan of the sour cream and chicken enchiladas! I love coming here!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In late spring I was in champagne and needed sandals. I had left the store once , but returned to buy a $200.00 pair of Fidelio sandals. I had nver in my life spent that much on a pair of shoes, I cant begin to tell you how angered I was when I was in y favorite shoe store in Geneva, Il and the owner told me I had been \""ripped\"" off and that those sandals cost between $150 and $165, but NEVER $200.00!!! He sells the same sandals. Mossers should be ashamed of themselves for deceptive practices!! Buyers beware. Those \""pricey\""  shoes are that way because the owner is stealing customers money!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went there to get some good chicken wings and the big problem was that they were cold! I have had better chicken wings in other Hooters. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  High End ? What make this high end?  Thy serve mimosas....and that is why some people think this is high end. I am in the restaurant business...as i usually say before writing a review. So...once again what makes The Wrigley Mansion high end....anyone ? The food is sub par. The service is fine. They have taken away several of the better offerings. 2nd time there and both times i asked what am I missing? Sure the mansion is nice...but brunch lacks...ALOT. Food was really unappealing and just zero wow..or even  \""thats nice\"". No real substance to anything food wise. Too bad it could be the place for brunch.......it is losing what it should be and worse it is showing the lack of true culinary innovation and in my opinion screams \"" hey we are the Wrigley mansion .....oh and yeah we have some sysco mid quality food to prove it\"". Real disappointment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I try to stay away from the chain joints because I always find myself writing mediocre reviews...and I hate writing mediocre reviews.  This was a work lunch so I had to attend.  Well, on to the review...restaurant from the outside seems clean and welcoming.  All of the stone work gives you the feeling of an Olive Garden.  Hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us.  1.00pm on a Thursday must not be a popular time.  \n\nWe were quickly escorted to our table and I immediately noticed bags of rags(kitchen or waiter rags) scattered across one of the dining tables.  I have to say...I am glad we were not seated at that table.  I am making the assumption they were clean.  I sure do hope so because they could have just been sitting on our table prior to our arrival.  Not a great presentation of the dining area.  Waitress came by, wish I had got her name, but she was very..what's the word I am looking for?  Maybe invasive, like a bull in a china shop?  I have never been reached over so much in my life without an excuse me or pardon me.  Apparently, drink orders, appetizers, and entrees are written in crayon on the paper tablecloth in front of me.  Not really my favorite way of taking an order but...just my opinion.  \n\nHad a warm spinach salad with shrimp.  Hmmm, I know it's lunch and everything, but 5 overcooked frozen shrimp?  Tough, clearly overcooked, and just downright horrible.  I think I would have had better luck buying frozen at the grocery store.  I rarely complain anymore because its just not worth it and I don't have the time.  Will not be visiting again.  I hope others have a better experience with different entrees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't give 2 stars that often but sorry Kim - you were a bitter disappointment. \n\nI was excited to have found a Sushi place in Pittsburgh in walking distance to my apartment. That excitement didn't last for too long when I entered the place on a Monday evening at 7pm, realizing that I was the only one in a rather spacious restaurant.\n\nFine, I had a Sushi craving and couldn't care less. Until the Sushi arrived. I ordered my Spicy Tuna and Salmon rolls, both came within 2 minutes. Strange? Maybe, or just a super fast chef. Sadly, the rolls were falling apart as soon as I looked at them, and the Salmon even tasted... bad. I had to leave it on the plate, which has never happened to me before.\n\nOn the plus side, the miso soup was okay and the service was very attentive, which is not surprising if you're the only one in that place. As there are not too many Korean options in Pittsburgh I encourage you to try the Korean BBQ, especially as the reviews for the Korean food at Kim's on Yelp are not that bad. But for the Sushi - forget it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband has revoked my Groupon privileges. If this review was just for the food it would be an easy 3 or 3.5 stars. The food was all delicious - we had the sauteed eggplant appetizer, the cucumber/tomato/onion salad, shishkabob dinner and burg dinner (not what I ordered but it was still good.) The rest of the experience was kind of bizarre.\n\nWe arrived early on a Saturday evening and were the only dine-in patrons. There were a few booths in the back corner with patrons smoking hookah but it was nearly empty the entire 90+ minutes we were there. There was also some take-out business at the same time. A host led us to a table near the couches/stage area in the back. I immediately noticed that one of the workers (?) was napping on a couch about 10 feet away. \n\nThe music was just something off the laptop of one of the hookah patrons, mostly obscure rap music.\n\nHere's where things got a little weird. We were completely finished eating and the staff was around fixing some other tables (at this point we're still the only dine in patrons), and then they pull some tables together and the entire staff sits down for dinner in the front of the restaurant. We waited another 20-25 minutes for our waitress to come back and ask if we were finished or wanted dessert. The answer was a resounding no. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sunday Brunch was perfect!!! Cold Buffet with warm individual orders that were the perfect size to order 3 or 4. Coffee was excellent as was the service. Our Server, John was there when needed and anticipated our every need. I would go back again and again, except I couldn't keep the weight off...lol\nHighly recommended!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place for coffee and good studying!! Or the other way around? Whichever. \n\nAnyway the coffee is great, I always get the Cafe Caramel in a To-Go cup since it gets cold faster with the indoor mug. The taste is always good, sometimes a little strong, but nothing a little sugar couldn't fix. \n\nThe environment varies ... sometimes it's nice, and sometime's it's not; it depends on the crowd. \n\nI had one occasion where some Asian girl was sitting in front of me and kept talking to herself ... which was uhh hella weird. Another instance had some girl in basically tight boxershorts showing off cellulite to the world like there's no tomorrow. And the most unforgettable one was where the place was packed and some smelly ass guy sat next to me. I had to get 2 hours of studying done to prepare for the next day and I couldn't move and this guy just killed my night ... \n\nAs far as customer service, it's fair. You order up front, wait a couple of minutes, get your drink and study the night away.\n\nNot the best cafe, but I return here frequently to get studying/work done. I would recommend this place to others. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has gone down hill.  I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \""had\"".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had good experiences with Jackie at Patches and Pieces. I have taken in both my wedding gown and a bridesmaid dress. On the wedding gown, the only thing I needed was a bustle put in and that only ended up being one loop so it was very simple. However, she showed me different options and offered her advice and suggestions. The bridesmaid dress needed to be taken in on the sides and again I think she had good advice and offered her thoughts to make it more fitted while still allowing me to move. I think Jackie has good knowledge and does an excellent job, she is personable and she has great prices. I never feel like I am being taken advantage of like at bridal salons that do tailoring. I would definitely recommend Patches and Pieces.\n\nMy only negative about the service is that both times I had to call her to find out when my pieces would be finished. I brought them both in well in advance, so I know she ther more pressing pieces. However, both times I called well after the date she told me they would be done and then she would tell me they would be done by the end of the week (they always were). This was fine for me since they were not rushes and she asked when the events were, so she knew they didn't need to be done right away. It's just something to keep in mind that you may need to call about your pieces if the are taking longer then promised. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I drove by this location earlier today and was a little sad that they were closed for good... then I realized, who needs Borders when you have a perfectly good Half Price Books across the street? And a B&N nearby? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> one of my favorite restaurants! This is by far the richest bolgolgi I have ever tasted. The staff is the friendliest, Michael is my favorite waiter..super funny! Yes, I am slightly bias because I am Korean but its great food. It's def more on the pricey side I would say compared to most Korean places. I always order the fried pork dumplings and beef bolgolgi. It's obviously cheaper during lunch but I feel that the portions are rather small in the \""box\"" your food comes in. I'm not impressed with their alcohol selection, they need more mixed drinks! I have never tried the sushi so can't comment on that. I do wish it was more of the traditional Korean BBQ. They bring a small cooker to your table and make it but still isn't the same. Nonetheless food is great, this place is def worth checking out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This bar is white trash. They over charged us but we tipped them$5 anyway just to take the high road. Then the weird looking bartender with the shaved head, Jen and the crazy looking one with fake...everything, suzi started yelling that we didn't tip the enough. They even had their ugly little mountain man posse follow us out to our car. My husband warned the guys to leave and told them if they tried to attack us he would defend us ...and that he did! A bunch of weirdos and complete morons. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Caught them fraudulently misrepresenting a product again, scamming if you like.\n\nAll that talk about subs put me in the mood for a good NY style hero and I decided to treat myself at D &D. The board said : \""Italian Hero\"", french bread, provolone, Genoa salami, spicy cappicola (or maybe it was Brescaiola?), and PARMA prosciutto w/oil & balsamic $9.50.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was they didn't fold the meats, juts plopped them flat.\nThe second thing I noticed is there was not enough meat to fold it - which explained the first thing\nThe third thing I noticed was that I could not taste the Parma, so I take the sandwich apart and I find 1 slice of provolone, 4 of salami, two small of cappicola and one (1) slice of prosciutto, all of them super thin of course.  \n\nThat cappicola was OK, the Genoa was the domestic generic type which didn't surprise me, but what did was the Parma was NOT Parma. It was colorless, tasteless, looked like paper the sandwich was wrapped in, the cheapest of the domestic imitations IOWs. \n\nTHIS is what Parma prosciutto  looks like: bright pink : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg/640px-Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg\n\nI ate the transparent slice of prosciutto on its own and still could not taste any of it, you'd probably need a much thicker slice to get any flavor. \n\nI went back inside and checked the cold cut counter and sure enough not one of their 4 types of prosciutto on display looked anything like it. So what you get in a D&D sub is a thin portion of cheap domestic cold cuts pretending to be imported.\n\nI called the manager, he said he would talk to the chef about it (I smell bull) and refunded me. He also offered me a free lunch on the house which I turned down. I'm not looking for a freebie,  but when I buy a premium item I want to get what I paid for. Instead D&D mistook me for a sucker. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We brought boyfriends car here based on a recommendation from a friend. Boyfriend knew immediately to check Yelp and all of the reviews are amazing. \n\nThey were so communicative it was insane. We have brought his car other places and it would take days to get a response. These guys clearly pride themselves on communication and customer service. \n\nWe dropped the car off after hours and he had it back the next day after a quick call and explanation. These guys want to give you the best deal possible. They had some coupons they offered which helped us out (even if just a bit).\n\nIf you think their service is a little more expensive, its worth it!!! Having taken the car other places and not had service like this, we would take both of our cars back here and pay far more than any other place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food was good but our waiter was horrible and our lunch (at 2 in the afternoon) took over 2 hours because the service was so slow. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\n\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I also found her rude, unwilling to answer questions. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nothing special to note about this location of the Papa John's chain.  They generally perform reasonably well, and most times you will notice that they are staffed well enough to handle things - but you will also typically notice that the staff ends up using this to their disadvantage.\n\nThe last time we were there to pick up a pizza (which was paid for online, so they just needed to look at it and pull it off the rack), three people took several minutes looking at another order - for a customer who was not standing there waiting for their order. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was looking for a new doctor and came across Arcadia Family Clinic. I called to make my appointment on a Monday. They verified my insurance while I was on the phone and I was excited to hear there was an open appointment the next day! When I went for my appointment I had my insurance card and ID ready as they had asked the day before. When I was called up to the desk ( 10 min after arriving) I was told immediately that they don't take my insurance! I told the woman at the desk that they had just verified it the day before. She looked in a folder and said sorry we don't take this. I don't understand how I can sit on a phone call for 7 minutes the day before and be told to come in only to be turned away immediately! I wasted my time at this clinic and they weren't even apologetic about the situation. I hope the next doctor I try is at least compassionate! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Klein's is located near my home, so I decided to get some of my vegetable plants for my garden there.  First off, if you are claustrophobic, probably not the place for you. I felt they packed way too many things in their greenhouses, and the walking paths are narrow. They shouldn't even allow carts throughout because it's too cramped. When it's busy there, it's extremely hard to get around in there. I found myself getting very crabby and wanting to walk out. Also, watch where you are walking - very uneven ground, cords and boards laying around.\nI decided to get a few pepper plants there as they have a variety that I really like.  My sister also bought this variety. A few weeks later after planting, we both started seeing problems in our gardens. The plants had been diseased, and it was spreading to other crops. The disease spread to other pepper plants that I purchased from elsewhere. It's very frustrating to put a lot of work and effort in to a garden, and now I'm not going to have any yield in peppers.  Thanks Klein's! :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is good. Even the sandwiches. However recently something seems a miss. My big rig pasta was not up to par.  Noodles were doughy and chewy and clearly different sized than the old method. The chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style.  Sauce watery but still spicy.  Disappointing since this is a place you are willing to wait for.  \n\nStaff is also so young and distracted with one another at camelback location. You feel a bit like your cramping their style. They are busy gossiping and making their after work plans so when they turn to attend to you with the over the top smiles and same question they asked only moments ago, it's a little annoying. \n\nKid friendly.  Long waits. But now inconsistent food... Drops a notch for me. \nI'll give it another try before I take these guys our of my rotation.  We usually get take out anyway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I must admit that I love Apple products and it is very difficult for me to write a negative review about Apple. Ever since my PC died the day before a major paper was due freshman year, I have been a Mac user, a PC hater, and I scoff at the Windows OS. \n\nI have been to this location twice for two different reasons. The first was to buy an iPhone 4 cover and the second time was for an Apple Care/iPhone hardware problem.\n\nFirst time: I waltzed in around 10:15 and headed to the accessories area in the back, after being greeted by a friendly employee. Normal. After a few minutes of debating different cases, I asked for help. I noticed that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews wrote about bad customer service/being ignored, especially when those Yelpers only aimed to buy the less pricey items. I received great treatment. My Apple guy pointed out two cases that met my specifications and suggested the one that was cheaper. Excellent. I was out the door in less than 20 minutes.\n\nSecond time: My iPhone 4 was on the fritz and I couldn't make or receive calls. \n\nSince this was not my first Apple product, I knew to call Apple Care first and talk to someone over the phone, who would then set up an in-person appointment for me whenever I wanted and wherever I wanted. (Tip for new Apple users. The phone people are great and super nice!)\n\nWalked into the Biltmore store 5 minutes before my appointed time and ended up waiting for 30 minutes. Ugh. But when Brandon did get to me, he was great. Although he tried to convince me that my problem was software-based and not hardware-based (as the phone Apple Care guy and I determined), he was a total sweetheart when I walked back into the store not 10 minutes after I initially left with a phone still unable to make/receive calls. He got to me right away and switched out my broken phone for a new one. The second time only took 10 minutes and my new phone is great.\n\nTwo small suggestions for the store:\n1) Stop scheduling your Genius appointments so close together. You know that some problems take longer to fix than anticipated and that makes all the subsequent appoints late. I like your store, but I don't want to sit around for an extra 30 minutes when I could have just been scheduled later.\n\n2) Apple stores need to have the same express pass phrase that the Apple Care phone system has. I know that some Apple users might not understand certain tech things, but I do not want to be told that I have a software problem when I know that I have a hardware problem and I have to return to the store ten minutes later! Give me that pass phrase that lets my Genius person know that I know what I am talking about. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If the Chinese economy has a \""hard landing,\"" it will look like Cofco Cultural Center. \n\nMost of the storefronts are empty. There's one gift store, woefully declaring \""yes, we're open!\"" There are restaurants on either side of Ranch Market that may be the same restaurant with different names. The architecture is pretty in a \""Disney does China\"" way, but it's essentially a strip mall with a high vacancy rate, anchored by a supermarket. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Always a long wait to see the doctor. Today waited an hour and a half with no one updating me with ones going on or an apology. Went to get a refund of my copay and still no apology or even an option of let me see how much longer. Becky may be great but the front staff will keep me from going back. Never happy with the staff every time I've gone and this what the icing on the cake. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park. \n\n We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And, the food was cold.\n\nThe kicker is that this  wasn't the first time this has happened.  A few weeks ago we all got exactly the same horrible level of service with cold mediocre food.\n\nIf I could give negative star rating I would. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For a football stadium BofA is pretty good. The layout is easy to get around- there's plenty of room to walk. Concessions are everywhere, and some are pretty good.  Find a JJR's BBQ Shack- the pulled pork is pretty good and the BBQ nachos may be the best stadium nachos ever.  \n\nIf you're in the upper levels, the stairs are steep. You can see the field from just about anywhere- even high up. Although with the Panthers playing, you'll probably have a better time enjoying the concessions and shopping. But if you do choose to watch, the seats are fairly comfortable. There's not a lot of leg room between rows of seats though, so climbing in and out of rows is a bit tricky.\n\nThis may not be the newest stadium out there, but it does the job. If you leave disappointed it won't be because of the stadium. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> great place.  great food.  perfect spice level and it doesn't interfere with the flavor.  had an everything bowl with vermicelli and some egg rolls.  very good.  quick for lunch too.   excellent pricing.  cant wait to eat here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of the fears with moving to a new place is not finding a good place for a haircut. I am so lucky as to find Red Hair on my 2nd day here in Champaign. Sue and Kee are absolutely amazing, they are very skilled and also friendly! I definitely recommend this place for anyone, looking for any kinds of haircut (I got a super short two block haircut, and I'm a girl). Thanks Red Hair! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.\n\nFirst, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. \n\nOur bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is good at this place, but for drive-through orders, I have been shorted on my order about 30-40% of the time.  If you go there, double-check your order regardless of how long it takes.  It'll be correct on the screen, but wrong in the bag, and usually missing something.\n\nOn a positive note, when I indicated I had a problem on their online survey, i got immediate and meaningful response from management.  However, the problem just occurred again today.  Management has more work to do. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As you pull down the promenade and approaching the hotel, you pass by some amazing shops, restaurants and a theater within walking distance.  The first thing that I noticed when I walked in past the giant fountain was the free wifi in the lobby.  Although wifi in the room is limited, short and slow.  The entrance is bright, open in a colonial style with piano and complimentary coffee, tea and cookies.  TV in the bathroom.  WOW!!  Not only that, but curved shower curtain and tiled shower.  The Neutrogena toiletries are a good touch.  The bedding was very comfortable.  Always love a free breakfast, but is also a great grocery and cafe next door.  Overall it is better than your typical Hampton with some great little touches. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Brought my iPad in to see why I wasn't able to get WiFi and the staff was quick to assist! As always the store is packed, but they are always readily available to help and direct you to the right department or person...Told me they would have the problem solved in 20 minutes - with plenty of stores close-by I was able to get a quick bite to eat while waiting!\n\nI also had to return an iPad case, which by the way was with out a receipt and past the return date, but with my credit card they were able to locate my purchase and return the charge to my card! \n\nMychael B (one of the Managers) assisted me, but everyone else seemed to be so willing to help me when he stepped away. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Read about it in some Phoenix guidebook, it is one of a kind place that is for sure. Place is located between two antic furniture stores so when you walk in you have furniture all around and then you walk into an old cafe. Witnesses are dressed the part since the placed opened in 1928 and look super cute, everyone is very friendly. I ordered beautiful green pistachio shake that was out of this world. Cool place to visit. <|endoftext|>

Thank you both, my daughter & I will be seeing you again soon :-) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I could easily get lost in Book Gallery and be there for weeks before covering all ground. I'd also drain my bank account completely. With discount prices on used books, an online search function, and a ton of new and old books, it's really quite a lovely bookstore. I love picking up random cheapy cookbooks and novels here for perusing and commute reading. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am not really sure what the hype is about. We went by in the afternoon and the place was cleaned out. We managed to get a few of what was left plus donut holes (my fave!). The donuts tasted fine - nothing spectacular and nothing I would drive out here for. We were pretty underwhelmed *sigh* <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been coming here for the last 3 years and have to say it always delivers.  The drink specials are addicting, the food is way beyond what you'd expect at a bar, and the scene on weekends is packed full of people looking to kick back after a long week's work, relax, and have a good time.  Highly recommended! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already. <|endoftext|>

After 53 minutes on the phone and trying to cancel service, I somehow agreed to keep the service for 6 months at a significantly reduced rate.  I then recieved  the bill the next month and the price had no change.  I called and they wrote in there notes some  othert agreement.  I asked to speak to manager and they denied me.  I told them I want my service canceled now and that I was not going to pay the bill.  They said no.  I asked for the manager he said no.  He then said if I ask for manager he will need to hang up.  He hung up.  His name is Jesus and will not give any other identification to me.  He is in the retention department.  If you are the manager of this employee, please review his work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I are absolute foodies, and this place is AWESOME!!  The seasoning is amazing!  My favorite thing on the menu is the Tinga Quesadilla, which is like spicy chicken.  It could get a bit crowded in there but its well worth it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> this place is on my list at least a couple times a month, and it's probably the only restaurant in madison that can claim that.  \n\nThe only thing I've got to say on the negative side is the crawfish off season are a bit mealy and I have switched to shimp.  everything else is spot on, esp the read beans and rice.  oh, and it's closed on  sunday...which is always the day you start to crave a po' boy. \n\nWhat do I say you get.  for 2 ppl, we get a full order of shrimp etoufee, shimp creole and a red bean and rice double meat.  all with french bread.  it's a ton of food but oh so good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food.  Great service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great little place. A previous review says it's not luxurious, but what they meant I think is that it's not huge and spendy like other places around. It is a sweet, calm, quiet place and Traci got right down to business during my massage. Highly recommended. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Another fun and delicious meal with the nieces.  Great iced tea as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows!\n\nI've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.  \n\nI had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place to buy any piece of furniture. The sales folk don't hound you to death and I found the living room set I bought from Pruitt's for hundreds of dollars more in other stores. They have earned my business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Recently married and used the \""Honeymoon Suite\"" First of all I want to give credit to the staff for keeping the facility so nice and clean inside and outside of the Inn. Lori helped me and let me say that she went above and beyond. Lori helped me by setting up the room in advance for my wedding night. Also Sheri the Inn manager was very sweet and welcoming. \nThe Honeymoon Suite was perfect, the private bathroom was nicely heated, clean, and very spacious. The King size bed was like sleeping on a cloud, the jacuzzi was amazing...I felt like I could never run out of hot water in the in room jacuzzi. I highly recommend this room to anyone wanting a romantic weekend. \nAgain the staff was amazing, room was very clean, and location is great, not to far from downtown Champaign, IL and a movie theatre down the road! \nI've stayed in a lot of hotels, especially growing up in Las Vegas. I personally think Senators Inn is one of the best places I have ever stayed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> the parking sucks no matter when you go.\n\nokay, i had to get that out of they way.  onto the good stuff.  the food here is heaven!!!!  i have tried the salads, reuben, tuna sandwich, red velvet cake and they are all great.\n\ni love the green chile burger!  it's the best i have ever had!  damn now i'm hungry.  the fries are great.\n\noh and this is the best place for an arnold palmer.\n\nthe best damn place ever. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pat Ruiloba rocks!  My tire had a nail in it on a Sunday and not a lot of places were open.  Pep Boys wanted 125 + for a basic tire.  Firestone.....not!  Quick and kind folks here.  Love!  I'll come back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First a warning, the parking lot will most likely be full, because it's not just for Soba. See a parking space on the street? Take it.\n\nSoba is a beautiful restaurant and lives up to the Big restaurant group expectations of unique flavors. The sushi is great, but if it was anything less than great I'd be worried about Soba. The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly with a wonderful coconut Thai sauce. The staff is very courteous, but I had a creeping feeling they were all \""egh a bunch of 22 year olds just walked in and they don't belong here.\""\n\nWe'll have to come back for drinks and dessert one day. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Seemed better more for lunch than dinner (I've done both), however, really good food (not the standard from what one would usually expect at Chinese Food places in Phoenix) & excellent pricing considering the sheer AMOUNT of food they pile on your plate! \n\nFed me for 2 days! Good place to bring your family, quiet date environment, & for a massive meal w/o breaking the bank. \n\nI have enjoyed the egg drop soup, orange chicken, beef & brocolli, crab puffs (w/ the hot mustard is delish!), etc... \n\nSeriously, they have the best food & wonderful  service of any Chinese restaurant I've had in the Valley! AND they deliver!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I like the food and the whole fondue experience of the Melting Pot but I give this place only 2 stars because on my last 2 visits, I had experienced terrible service.  When I go to a restaurant planning to spend a minimum of $30 per person (excluding drinks), I expect a better level of service than I have gotten here from hostesses and wait-staff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hate hate hate flying... but being from Portland, OR where my family is from I fly here and there a couple times a year. Charlotte... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok. \n\nIt is not really that hard to find  your way around but one of my big pet peaves is lots of displays and things like carts getting in the way of rushing to a terminal. Some of the walkways seem narrow  but that could be just me. Hate security here. I had one flight where I got delayed over night (at the airport for about 16hours) and the only thing I got was a t-shirt and some tooth hygiene things. Luckily a sweet lady who was one of those star partners(?) got me a alternative flight that got me home faster than the delayed plane would have.\n\nBesides all that at least CLT isn't Atlanta or Newark! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had lunch here with Norm R. and Rand H. and after trying almost every indian buffet in the valley ,this one is got to be in the top 5.The buffet itself is layed out nicely and the food is always real good.This visit the onion cauliflower pakora was the big hit ,I could have ate just a big plate of those and been happy. The naan bread that was brought to are table was not the garlic type but was very good as well. The desserts here were great to they had mango pudding with fruit cocktail mixed in and rice pudding. (no monkey balls today)?Anyway it was a great lunch and 5 stars for them today. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We purchased a child seat for the back of our bike that was on display in their store and brought our bike in to have it put on.  After loudly complaining about how hard it may be to install, they told me it would be 5 days.  I left the bike and said not a problem.  Happily they called 2 days later.  The child seat they put on was not the same child seat in the store.  When I questioned them about it, they stated that it was the same seat just a different model.  I said it looks quite different as the bar does not go over the head and the foot rests are not adjustable.  They stated that it was the same quality/same seat but just a different model.  I took the bike home and my kid loves it.  After we took our first ride I did a little research.  Come to find out that the seat they put on is the cheaper version that is not as safe or strong as the one I requested and thought I was getting.  The non caring and looking at me as if I was wrong when I questioned the bike seat was not necessary and I nor my family (with 2 young kids that will be getting many new bikes over the next 10 years) will never be back.\n\nIf you are putting a different product than purchased it should be told to the customer and they should not be shamed when asking about it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stopped here today for lunch after Pei Wei put me on hold. I was starving and needed food fast- plus I had a taste for something asian. \nIt seems they have changed their name to Tara Thai? At least thats what the sign seemed to say(?) \n\nI opted for the buffet to go and was impressed by all the different selections- especially of noodles. I have a thing for noodles and tried three different kinds- one of which, called simply Chicken Noodles was AH-mazing! Big thick flat noodles with hunks of chicken and bean sprouts and onions. The Pad Thai noodles were also pretty scrumptious. \n\nThe onlly thing I didn't enjoy were the eggrolls. They looked like they were straight from a La Choy freezer box. Instead of homemade and all big and bumpy they were finger sized with that weird dough that is flaky on the outside but retains all the grease inside and tastes like hot dirt. Anyway, not a big deal but I'd figured I'd mention it. Must go back for the noodles. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Somewhere between BAD & BLAH...\n\ndescribes the bland food our group had here. The setting is very nice & the margaritas are good but that's it. The food was very bland, lukewarm, just disappointing. Usually so-so Mexican food can be made more tolerable with some salsa but even the salsa here doesn't help. \n\nAlso, if there are unruly children using the bocce ball court crashing the balls into the wooden frame like when we were there, it makes the lovely outdoor patio a much less desirable place to be.\n\nDefinitely will not go here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came with with friends during lunch. Very busy with short wait times. Very loud too. Difficult to hold conversations. Seating too close together. \n\nWaitress was polite and very attentive. I had the Friday special- salad and cup of lobster soup. Very basic. Soup was mediocre. Definitely not homemade. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm a big fan of Schlotzkys, so you can imagine my disappointment when I was confronted by a rude old man at the register about my signature being worn off the back of my debit card.\n\n\""Eh, it's time to get a new card huh? Technically I shouldn't take this.\""\n\nAs if I should feel grateful that he uses the same card that everyone else does to take money from MY account for MY lunch. It just went downhill from there. When I explained that I hadn't signed it, but written \""See ID\"" on it, he almost refused to take it. He was short tempered, rude and snobbish. And it was the same sort of attitude and snide commentary the first time I went here.\n\nI won't be going back. I don't need to be insulted and treated like an inconvenience with my lunch. Shame too, it's the only one within two miles of my home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really was blown away at how poorly I was treated here. Family politics trumped customer service, however the massage by Taryn was marvelous. \n\nThey have a $20 first time deal that I did for my self and my finacee. I scheduled them back to back, and she couldn't make it. So I had talked to the woman receptionist (wife of dr.) and asked if I could take hers for the $20 price and join them together for a longer massage. She said they usually don't do that, so I asked the therapist when I got there explaining to her the conversation I had with the woman before. Any ways I was under the impression that I was just paying $40 after the therapist came back and said \""OK\"" after my request.\n\nEither way after a simple misunderstanding, the family teamed up on me telling me I was wrong. So walking out of a fantastic massage right into the firing range of this troubled family business. The wife and the husband got into an argument in front of me that was not tame to say the least \n\nAt best my experience at Arcadia Chiropractic was horribly awkward. Anyways- the massage was really good, but the after effects made me feel worse than when I walked in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nice place to catch up with your girlfriends over glasses (and more glasses) of wine. Patio Platter on the Patio...must I say more? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Gone downhill.  Service was awful.  Ordered soup, their \""special\"" shrimp dish and pork fried rice.  The soup was served and that was the last we saw of our waiter for 45 minutes.  People who arrived well after us were served and left.  When finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste.  Once we'd finished, we sat watching for our waiter, who never showed, before I got up, went of the cashier and asked for a check.  This has been one of our regular neighborhood go to restaurants for take out and dine in.  NEVER AGAIN! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Maybe my standards are too high. I had high hopes for the breakfast biscuits here, based on various reviews online, but in the end they taste like frozen biscuits with various toppings. I had a chicken biscuit, and the boyfriend had egg and bacon. Both biscuits had that sweet, frozen/refrigerated/pre-made biscuit taste, rather than a true buttermilk biscuit taste. If I'm getting chicken / bacon / other savory items on my biscuit, I don't want the biscuit to be sweet! We also got potatoes, which were good, but they were nothing particularly special. In the end, I can make a better biscuit, and even the biscuit sandwiches from Bojangles are probably better than these (gasp). \n\nI want to go back to Art's for lunch soon, because I really, truly loved the atmosphere in there. The staff were amazingly nice, it's a cute little place, my order was ready quickly, and I like to support local business. But the biscuits just don't cut it for me to try them again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  so, i go in and order a gyro (yee-ro - you know, how you're supposed to say it).  the server goes you mean a 'jai-ro?!' (as in gyroscope), in a very loud kind of condescending voice.  i said, no, i mean a 'yee-ro'.  as if she didn't know what i was talking about anyway!\n\nwith the greek authenticity of the place seriously in question, i should've walked away then, but i was really hungry and didn't have a lot of time for lunch.  it was just average, nothing special.  again, i've been spoiled by NYC.  besides, i think it's a good policy to not eat where they can't properly pronounce what they're serving. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went to the Green Lantern last Friday and it was our first visit there.Several of our friends had always spoken highly of it so we thought we would give their Friday Fish fry a try. I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum, but nothing this awesome.\n\nThe Carnegie Museum houses two very nice museums. Natural History and Art. The Natural History Museum is very impressive and it's cool knowing that all the specimens belong to the museum and they aren't on loan from some hoity-toity New York museum. It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones. My accompaniment had to stifle all my Jurassic Park \""Mr. DNA\"" references.\n\nThe art section is also quite impressive. I personally still prefer my Detroit Institute of Art, but this museum is still nice. I got a little confused about how to walk around. I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be. The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love.\n\nThis is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really want to like Zoe's Kitchen. I do. I really, really do. \n\nI have been to Zoe's more than 5 but less than 10 times, and yesterday was my last visit, unless I want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake. \n\nI have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice .... \n\nDo you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes. \n\nSo, so sad! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This location is convenient and that is why I gave it 1 star. Honestly every time I go here my order is wrong. I have come to the point where I make them repeat it back to me and they still mess the order up. I've even Gone to the point at the window to ask them if my order is correct they say \""yes of course\"" I will get it and check it and it's wrong. I understand it gets busy but that doesn't mean serve your customer whatever the hell you want. I have allergies to foods and if it wasn't for me checking everything I eat DQ may have landed me in the ER more then once. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've lived in the Biltmore/Camelback Corridor area for some time and had always driven by Rochelle's but never stopped in.  I finally got tired of my longtime hair dresser never listening to me and popped in one day.  My only request for my first appointment was that I work with someone who is good with long hair (I'm like a modern-day Rapunzel, or Dee Snider if you prefer).  I had my first appointment with Dania a couple of months ago, and I'm kicking myself for not visiting Rochelle's sooner!  Dania is extremely skilled at what she does, and she's really just a treat to be around.  I've been to see her three times now (once for a quick 'fix' because I'm picky, and she was all smiles to do so!) and I don't think I'll ever trust my hair to anyone else.  I've gotten SO MANY compliments on my cut and color, it makes me wonder why I stayed at my old salon for so long...\n\nThe salon itself is great, too.  Much more modern and spacious than my old salon, with better music and magazines to boot (the important stuff, right?).  I also love that they use Bumble & bumble products!  Dania and Rochelle's have a customer for life. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My boyfriend's grandmother celebrated her 90th birthday here. It was a lovely location, at the foot of Cammelback Mountain.  She was the happiest that I've ever seen her.  Being that she is a lifelong Catholic, it was a really special location for her. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Yeah yeah, whole paycheck, cry me a river. Everyone knows exactly what to expect here, I'm not going to whine about high prices. The prepared foods area at this WF is much more restrained than at any other WF I've been to, which is sad because I used to love ogling the selections at my Boston shop. I think this location has a somewhat small but interesting wine selection but my real purpose for this review is to talk about the cheese shop. \n\nArizonans have absolutely no cheese culture. Sorry. I love AZ and I'm glad I live here, but when I think about exotic cheese I don't think 'gruyere'. Cheese selection is the only way in which Arizona has failed me, until I met Laura, my Whole Foods Cheese Monger (not Lara of Petit Fromage).  After truly depressing excursions to AJs (their cheese is a JOKE and they should be embarrassed), then Trader Joe's and Safeway I called over to Whole Foods and connected with Laura. I asked her about certain cheeses I was looking for and we agreed to meet that evening to find unique options for a wine tasting I was hosting. \n\n Laura explained that in the heat of the summer her cheese selection is rather sparse and that it would be picking back up in the fall. The cheese area is one of the smaller that I've seen, but there are some fun options beyond a simple Parrano or Gorgonzola Dolce. I saw some of my old favs like Taleggio, Explorateur, and Humboldt Fog and Laura introduced me to a few new friends, like Hirtenkase, the delightful german cheese that is made from some of the most pampered cows in the world! I decided on a refreshing chevre called Fleur Vert from California, Mimolette and Chaubier, though Laura very generously let me taste through a horde of options to find the right cheese and wine pairings. \n\nI really look forward to checking back in with her to see what new treats are in. I hope I can use her expertise for more wine events and I encourage you, nay, I insist you step away from that enormous Costco Manchego and talk to the Whole Foods Cheese staff about your exotic dairy needs. Broaden your horizons! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wanted to give everyone an update from the last review I wrote about the Phoenix Airport Marriott experience. So, the General Manager, Jeff Bhatti, replied to the letter that me and my colleagues sent to them about their associate interaction and they basically told us that they received the letter, apologized for any inconvenience.\n\nHe also wrote in the letter:\n\n\""It is our objective to provide each and ever guest a comfortable stay with utmost respect and privacy. Your comments play a critical role in our success and progress. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention. Based on you comments, I have shared my concerns with the staff and emphasized review of our training and procedures. We shall implement and improve any steps needed to ensure that our guests have a positive experience at the hotel. We are grateful for having had many opportunities over several of past years to successfully take care of hospitality needs of our guests while in Phoenix area. We look forward to continue with such relationship and will do our very best to prove our commitment to our objective.\""\n\nWhen we read that letter, we just looked at each other like that was just BS and were not satisfied by the half ass letter we received from the General Manager. First of all, there were spelling errors in the letter, and second of all, for them to say that they provide each and every guest a comfortable stay with the utmost respect and privacy. The two words he used, \""RESPECT\"" and \""PRIVACY\"" were two elements that the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel did not demonstrate to us during our time at their hotel. The guest relations worker did not show us RESPECT when she was talking back at us and asking if we planned to make any more noise after I expressed my concern about her sending strange men up to our room w/out any warning or notice to bring down the noise level (which there weren't any, we were just talking in our room. \n\nThere were no music on, no tv on, no blow dryer on, we were just talking our normal tones but I don't know if the walls are just SUPER thin or what but regardless, we should have received a phone call from them in the first place.). For her to say \""So you plan to make more noise next time?\"" I wanted to be like \""No B****, I'm not! Stop being so fresh with me because I wasn't even trying to say that!! I was just bringing up my concern that there were two large men standing outside telling us it is our second warning and to OPEN the door when we haven't even received the FIRST warning in the first place!! Now, THAT is wrong and that is a violation of our PRIVACY!! Additionally, my friend told me that when we got into the hotel room, she noticed that those two men .. the SAME men that asked us to open the door, were checking us out at the hotel lobby. They were looking at us up and down which creeped out my friend. Since, we have 3 young ladies staying in the room, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE OPEN THE DOOR to TWO STRANGERS who were checking us out and Open the door for them?! We aren't even sure if they are hotel security. But regardless, the hotel did not make us feel SAFE or COMFORTABLE at all and again, me and my colleagues are extremely disappointed in how the management has handled our concerns.\n\nBasically, the letter that was sent to us was BS BS BS! Our company will never stay at their hotel again and I will make sure to spread the word to all our friends and family because when I do inform them about our horrible experience, they are absolutely appalled that the hotel made no efforts in making up the experience for us in any way. The \""thank you for bringing this up to our attention\"" is BS to us and we will make sure that everyone who is looking for a hotel in Phoenix will never come to this establishment again. \n\nThank you for letter but we would rather give our business to another hotel that actually cares about their reputation and their guests! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Before I say the bad, I must say the good. Kelly Clark Auto has very nice service, they explain everything and treat you with patience and some respect. Problem is they sell you so much BS and unnecessary fixes. I took my car to a mechanic friend right before and I didn't need half of what they recommended. Kelly Clark is also quite late compared to when they say the car will be ready. But the biggest issue is the price. WOW, they are not cheap. Sorry, I ain't going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stayed at the Pointe Hotel on a stacation and tried unsuccessfully to get reservations at A Different Point of View, so ended up here.\nWhat a disappointment. I had the Trout and, my mistake, asked for it to be saut\u00e9ed, it was overlooked and tasted of butter. The potatoes and all the other veggies that came with it were so buttered that this was all you could taste. Head Office had the Salmon which she said was fine.\nThe reason we had fish was because there was absolutely nothing on the menu that was Veggie, though our overthetop waiter did offer to make something up from another dish. Overall, a bad experience and I had been there before many years ago and also to the one at the South Mountain point and was not disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  On name alone we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.\n\nOuch!\n\nBandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.\n\nI've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong; the female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.\n\nThe squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated \""Bandaids Show Lounge\"" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with \""damn, I'mma get mugged out here\"" uncertainty and darkness.\n\nOnce inside (yes, you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed \""no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees\"" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag. Classy!\n\nAfter getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really, really good-looking - hottest girl on staff, setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next to, the center stage.\n\nMost of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, mostly empty on a Friday night...\n... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.\n... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, more amply-bossomed strippers.\n... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.\n\nGirl after girl (a couple of \""a'ight\"" girls, most \""everyday\"" girls, and at least one \""is that a girl?\"" girls) came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection \""...would you like a dance?  ...would you like a dance?\"" propositioning. Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, right?\n\nNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.\n\nAfter a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of \""meh\"" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...\n...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...\n...the summation of the Bandaids experience...\n...that's when we saw it... \n\n...The HOOD-KINI*!\n\nIt was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid-alluding and Infectious-disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.\n\n\""Band-Aids\"", because correlating \""possibility of infection\"" and adult entertainment is savvy business sense.\n____________________\nYes, yes.  A hooded bikini.\nIn black and neon. A hood to obscure her face, while thin straps and patches of material covered her naughty bits.  A. Hooded.  Bikini.  If she were gonna take your money, she might as well look the part. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I dunno if I just get bad luck but I'll never order from this place again. I keep giving it a chance but this was the last straw. Twice I have ordered from here and found metal from scrub pads in the lo  mein noodles. I luckily did not ingest it which would have possibly torn up my intestines. When I brought the metal in and showed them they offered to rebook another order. I don't think anyone really understood the seriousness of this. I told them it was the premise of it. That is a hazard not someone complaining about the tastiness. I got a call saying they would give me a $10 credit if I came back. To be honest I was offended and just shook my head. So I though 4 months later since this place is literally right around the corner I'd give it a try. This time honestly it just tasted aweful. It tasted like everything was cooked in a pan with something that was burned before. I am not being picky here it literally tasted like I was sacking on a charcoal briquet. I'm pretty much done with this place and question the quality of food ordered and hygiene practices. Chinese restaurant are notorious for bad sanitation scores and this place is clearly pushing it. For your own health as far as eating metal stay as far from this place as you can. I'd rather get frozen Chinese from grocery store and microwave and it would be better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great Mexican Food & Service is Amazing.  Also Clean. Loved it that I came 2 days in a row. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible experience, don't sit on the patio. We waited at least 25 minutes after being seated for lunch.  Nobody ever came to our table.  Finally somebody showed up and went to 2 other tables who had showed up 5 minutes or more after us.  She didn't have the courtesy of saying \""I'll be right there\"". The place was slow so there was no excuse.  Not sure if the food was any good. We walked out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The Thai carved wood and overall decor is amazing- and the service was fine. Sorry to disagree with others, but my wife and I found the food to be quite ordinary and well-below quality at other Thai restaurants we visit. \n\nThe fried spring rolls were greasy- possibly were just fried a second time to get them hot. The Mee Krob was a good appetizer except the lettuce was partially wilted and brown in spots. I usually love pad thai but what was served had soggy noodles and not a lot of taste. \n\nPerhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night I was there. Not likely to try again though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i will only give it 2 stars b/c the dj for karoake was awesome and the food was good. on the negatives-some of the worst service i've ever had and i've been to a lot of bars/restaurants. the server repeatedly forgot my tables drinks. at one point i just went up to the bar to get a refill-it was so much quicker. my fiance went to get my one drink that was sitting at the bar for 10 minutes when she saw that she got it and gave it to me saying there was computer problems-hmm yea right. i had to ask for my check twice because i was waiting for 20 minutes for it. just terrible and i could on but i'll spare you. trust me i was a server for years so i understand getting slammed but it wasn't busy and she should've asked for help and not made up that there was computer problems. also i got a mixed drink and so did my friend and it didn't taste like any alcohol. despite all this my friends and i still had a really good time b/c of karoake. still don't think ill be back there anytime soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The place reminds me a lot of my freshman dorm. Peeling walls, fluorescent lighting flickering in the elevator and strange humid smells. Although my bed and bathroom were pretty clean, and the staff were really great, the hotel itself is pretty old and resembles a trucker motel. Way overpriced for what it is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok, normally I would not review a fast food restaurant. Because lets face it most of us have the same experience every time we go to a fast food place. I feel obligated here though because it was one of the worst experiences I have had at any establishment. \n\nI pull into the parking lot and the line was quite long, so I decide to park and order inside and get it to go. I give the homeless guy outside a dollar and make my way inside, this is normal on this side of town. When I enter I see there is a long line inside as well. Note to anyone, do not let hungry control you it was my mistake on this day. \n\nThere was ONE person working the front of Wendys, not only was she taking peoples orders. She was also bagging the food, frying the fries and she was most likely making the burgers as well. I stood inline for probably 15 minutes, to get Wendys. When I should have left and just went to Cook Out down the street or even Pinky's. At least at Pinky's you have food in front of you in under 15 minutes. \n\nI took my burger home, I was polite to the girl working because I truly felt bad for her. I get home and open my food. I wish I was surprised but it was ice cold. The bun was firm like it was quite old. The cheese was hardly melted. So not only did I wait 15 minutes but I also got horrible fast food. Oxymoron I know but COME ON! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Swing around the loading docks behind the Dollar Tree, or head down the service corridor from Wal-Mart and you will spot a charming lit sign that reads BAR. Once inside, before your eyes even get used to the dark, you are greeted by the lone barmaid. Just put your hands out in front of you and follow her voice to a cushy brown vinyl seat till your eyes adjust to the neon and the bright white of the ice hockey rink that's separated from the rear bar by double-paned plexiglass.\n\nIt's a unique experience to enjoy a craft beer while amateur hockey players smash into the glass, or while watching the slumbering pace of the Zamboni machine as it sweeps in between periods. The bottled craft &import beer selection of the Ice House is very impressive and nightly specials can be super cheap. And it looks like they've just added several taps. \n\nI always get great service from the staff, usually a solo barkeep. Sometimes they even put out hot dogs or other munchies, cooked on the patio. Whenever there is not a band or comedy night going on, it is quiet enough to have a conversation with someone from across the room, or to hear the TV audio -- take your pick from continuous int'l hockey coverage or classic movies /cable dramas on the two sets. Feed the jukebox, it's got some killer classic rock cuts.\n\nThis charmer of a dive is one of the Arcadia area's best kept secrets. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ryan has contacted me to apologize and pay for repairs to my door latch. I hate to think that so many has rewarded this company for its quality of work. I don't want to take away from that. I think it is a possibility that I just got rare off day at this shop. Wish them the best. Thank you, Ryan for reaching out and offering to pay for my repair. I've raised the rating one STAR to two. Sorry I couldn't add any more but since it the incident cost me a few days without my car, it was a bit inconvenient. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had the chance to visit this restaurant on a Sunday night.  Despite having seated most of the tables in the bar side of the restaurant, they seemed to have only one person actively waiting the tables.  It took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks...not cocktails, but diet coke and iced tea.  The waitress was friendly enough when she showed up to the table, but seemed relatively uninterested in doing so.\nWe ordered several items from the tapas menu (no entrees) and other tables that were seated after us received their food before we did.  I agree with the reviewer below that says that tapas should be brought out as they are prepared, not all at once.  But sure enough, 45 minutes later all our food arrives at once.\nThe food itself was all very good to excellent, but in hindsight it's the too cool for school attitude of the waitstaff that stands out in my mind, not the food.  That's a shame. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Looooove the griddled corn cakes!\n\nThe first time I came I made the mistake of ordering a salad...not that the salad wasn't good, it was just that I ended up wishing I had ordered a whole griddled corn cake for my entree instead after having a taste of it as an appetizer. The second time I came that was exactly what I did and I left very satisfied. Actually, any of their \""corn\"" food items are delicious--try the corn bread that comes with the soup--also absolutely amazing!\n\nI tend to find everything else I've tried a bit too salty or oily to my taste (for example, the bacon wrapped shrimp and the crispy eggplant sandwich), but seriously, the corn bread and cake makes up for it alllll. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this Dump!  Okay, so I am little biased because I am a breakdancer and finally got to meet a bunch of dancers for once. They all actually embraced me as soon as I started to boogie which was cool.  Its a great scene.  The mix in the crowd is from 21-50 which makes it a good time to mess with the cougars.  The mixed drinks are strong, but a little pricey.  Domestic beer is usually like $3. THe reason you come here though is for the 80's music, looking at people dressed in neon, and watching some old school pop and lock.  The video screens show classic 80's shots and commercials which brings me back. The only problem is that this place is semi dumpy.  Im glad its dark because I don't want to see what it looks like with all the lights on.  Also, the bathrooms could use some erggh cleaning! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So here it was Lenten season and Friday.  I was starving and in a city not like New Orleans in its available seafood fare!  What to do?  Remember that the British are  known for one food contribution....Fish and chips!  So you get on your bike and speed over to the place you've heard you can have a pastie, a sausage roll, and a steak and kidney pie on a regular footie day.  And Fish and Chips and a Strongbow Ale on a post  Mardi Gras Friday night!  \n\nAnd this place reeks of British wanna-bes and malt vinegar.  I think I even saw the reflection of the Queen Vic in the pool or urine out back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has a variety of exotic drinks and chocolates but it is kinda pricey. I could have gotten better chocolates at that price elsewhere because theirs taste like Hershey's. The drinks are worth trying but it is not great. I love that they have a nice view from the second storey especially but they DO NOT offer free wi-fi. So, I can't study or do research while in there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I must of went on a bad day. (Sunday around 4) Everyone was very disrespectful. Would not acknowledge me at the bar. She was too busy chatting with the strippers. One stripper gave my friend a dance without even asking. She was definitely on something. I could keep going. Not worth coming back. The attitudes here in general ruined our night. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a decent location if you happen to be near Market Square and you're craving Starbucks. It gets crazy busy and parking can be tough since it's in a touristy location, but the lines move pretty quick as they always seem adequately staffed.\n\nUnfortunately, this location has a limited retail area. We were looking to pick up some Verismo pods and they didn't carry any the last time we were there. Odd. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal, when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned, and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in America. Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere, not red lobster. I know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I used to use Nibbler's Catering when I managed events and meetings for a large office furniture company in Phoenix. They were always great to work with and the food was divine! I remember we had a huge corporate party that they catered and the finger foods they prepared were amazing!\n\nThe staff was there early, set up on time, and cleaned everything to boot. The owner, Diane (who happens to be Canadian eh), was always in touch and brought samples to office for all of us to taste.\n\nI used to cater one meeting a week and several large events each year, and Nibbler's was one of the best I'd come across. My current company uses them for breakfast catering and they have great breakfast burritos and sausages. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My sofa was delivered as promised without any real issues.  The sofa had a medium dirt smudge on the side despite being delivered in plastic.  I was told the delivery team would call me when they were 30 minutes from my place but they showed up without a call.  Regardless, they were friendly and efficient.  I'll be purchasing an occasional chair in the near future and I'll definitely make Pruitt's my first stop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's small crowded and hard to navigate. Not everything has a price tag that is easy to spot. They have some nice pieces , however the place has no personality. I literally felt like I was in a cramped attic. The pieces are for the most part priced close to what I would offer so I want complain about the prices. Still the pieces for what they are asking I would expect to be cleaned up better than they are. How about washing out some drawers and putting a little elbow grease into making these pieces look like they want out of the attic? A little oil, a bit of polish, a scrape filler here and there, give me a little effort for my money before I hand it over. \nThe other thing that gets me is that they have 4 locations. This sucks. If your consignment I really don't want to shop four stores in three parts of the valley in for things. This is one time a large location like UFO on 16th  got it right, <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Remember when Burger King was actually somewhat decent?  Pepperidge Farm remembers...\n\nI have dined with the King many a time across this fine land.  I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years.  At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player...\n\n...and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why.\n\nEVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes.  Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait.\n\nIt's always dirty.  When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning.  There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean.  This place is a hole.\n\nWhy does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house.  The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong.  What are they doing to the food?\n\nFix thyself, King, and maybe I'll return.  Until then, I will take my cheap, poorly constructed eats elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here to see a band out of upstate New York Sophistafunk recently and a great time was had by all.  \n\nThe place is one of the smaller music venues in the Charlotte.  But that smaller size actuality work in favor of Double Door, there is a very homey, friends and family vibe about the whole place.  Genny to High Life.  \n\nThe band, Sophistafunk can be described as just that - sophisticated funk music.  They brought alot of energy and had the audience of about 30 people all dancing and moving to the beat.  \n\nMy virgin experience at Double Door was good enough so that I would def return.  Don't go to Double Door expecting some sort of top-shelf, Fillmore-esq music venue.  Yet, it serves its place as its a great venue to see up and coming bands. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Bakers is the best from plants to those concrete gnomey kind of things that can inhabit your lawn and garden.  I have been going to Bakers for about 54 years.  When I was a little child I went with my mother, a woman who could literally grow anything and did, in the AZ heat.  The result I have seen just about any situation you can think of being dealt with using Bakers, successfully most of the time.  Truthfully, I have always had such a good experience here that anytime I have used anyone else, I end up returning.  They just can't be beat.  They answer your questions nicely about their tremendous supply of just about anything at any given time.  If your desire to garden never goes past house plants, they are just as much for you. They won't lie to you about what they sell. Don't expect to go home  from Bakers with what you planned on.  It will usually be more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We came here to see the play \""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!\"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat, the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was a guest at the resort. My girlfriend and I decided to book reservations for this restaurant. We were told our reservations would be at 800pm but when we arrived at 745pm they were changed without warning. After waiting 45 mins the hostess  let us know our table was ready. Then after walking up to the 3rd floor we were told by someone else that it would be another couple minutes. I understand its an experience but waiting 1 hour for a table when you have reservations is absolutely unprofessional especially for a half empty restaurant. When we finally were about to be seated the hostess asked me to take off my hat. I looked around there were people in shorts and T-shirts and I can't wear a hat. Already upset by the poor first impression I walked out before I was seated. The staff I encountered were rude and arrogant. Terrible experience and I will never go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We use to eat at this place frequently going  back to the 80's. Frequently turned into seldomly and after tonight from seldomly to not at all. The food I ordered is very heavy and not healthy, like the McDonald's of Mexican food.  Loaded with crap it did not even taste good. I think they forgot how to make Mexican food. It's too bad, I liked this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best Italian beef Phoenix has to offer, heck, it may be  best sandwich in all if Arizona..and I have tried many. Get it \""wet\""with cheese peppers and extra gravy..the only place you might find a better one is in chi-town itself...You NEED to bring one to Arrowhead area!!!! Please!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really want to give this place more stars but the food at Pho Van is so much better. Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking, and it also feels like home with the owner's kids running around. \n\nBut the bun thit nuong (pork vermicelli) was pretty sub-par, even with my already low expectations for a Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh (we're Vietnamese from Cali so our expectations are usually really high!). The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones). \n\nThe waiter/owner(?) is really sweet, and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong. I'll try this place once more and hope to give it a better review next time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Joe, at the door, is great, the music is loud, the bathrooms are gross, the bartender is decent enough, the booze is reasonable (were $3 \""you call its\"" a special for everyone for the hour before music started or just for our group? either way, fantastic. nothing off limits)... this place belongs on my Dives list.  As an added bonus, it's biking distance from my house, if I had a bike at my house.  I'll be back, Joe! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Unlike other airports I've been in where your options for food are your massive conglomerate chain restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King, Sky Harbor has a nice array of more local, higher quality restaurants for you to choose from (e.g., La Grande Orange, Olive and Ivy, Barrio Cafe), as well as some healthier choices compared to eating a greasy burger and fries (e.g., Paradise Bakery).  There are a lot of good parking options, whether you choose the airport's own parking lot or private lots that provide shuttle service.  I also appreciate the free wi-fi, it definitely helps whittle the time away while you are waiting for your flight! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Alright, I've got the same hangup most others have about this place. The food isn't bad, it's GOOD. They give you a lot for a good price. Don't expect genuine Chinese food, this is American Chinese food -- just like most Chinese restaurants in this country. \n\nNow here's the hangup I have with Taipei South. Customer service is lacking. The ladies that work the front aren't mean people at all, so let me make that point. But it's always a mixed bag. Sometimes orders are quickly placed, drinks always topped off, and food comes out quickly. But other times it can be the opposite. I'll use my last visit as an example:\n\nThe waitresses said little to nothing (which is the usual case). They did bring out a little jar of Dr Pepper so I could refill my cup faster, but the waitress at one point came by and took the jar and used it to refill another customers drink who didn't even know I had been using that jar... Then she put it back on my table. It was also past peak lunch hour (1:45 and 1/3 full) yet I waited 12 minutes by the time I got my check to when I got the receipt.\n\nReally this place just needs to be more hospitable. It would go a LOOONG way. Maybe they're content with where they're at? I'm sure they do fine since they serve good food. But it's no secret friendly and unforgettable service creates a memorable experience for the customer, something that causes them to always come back. I would love Taipei South to figure this out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could give NO stars this would be the place that deserves it.  We were in on a Thursday night at around 7pm.  There were a handful of patrons(certainly more staff than paying customers).  There was one bartender who was bothered to make drinks.  We watched him make a moijto and when he poured from the shaker to the glass he spilled some over including a lime and some mint that went onto the bar, he picked them up and put them back into the cup.  DISGUSTING! Then the 4 of us at the bar were ready to order another round and the bartender went MIA, we waved down 2 waitresses who went into the back and we never saw them again, 10 minutes later he came back and when asked \""what happened to you\"", he responded, \""I am busy, I need to clean the keg lines.\"" \n\nDon't waste you time here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They deserve a zero!  I called 12 hours ahead to schedule my early morning pickup for my family vacation. Since it was early, I confirmed it wasn't a problem and they assured me they had vehicles all over town 24 hours a day.\n\nAfter the requested time had passed, I called and was told they were still looking for a cab in the area.  \n\nI may not be the smartest guy in the room but I really thought was the reason I scheduled in advance. Being late for the airport resulted in needing to use short-term parking costing our family $200.  You can be certain that I will NOT be using Yellow Cab in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Baja is another staple in my lunch rotation. One of my favorite things about Baja is that I can be either really, really good with a healthy food selection, or I can be really, really bad. Either way, the ingredients are fresh and the food is good. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. \n\nI am a HUGE fan of salads, ever since Friday was salad bar day in elementary school, I have loved a good salad! However, with my salad I like good quality lettuce, with a nice color. Don't give me almost-white iceberg lettuce, no big yellow piece from the bottom, and no transparent pieces that indicate the lettuce was once frozen. Give me a good spring mix, some arugula or watercress, maybe some butter lettuce or romaine with a good green color. \n\nBaja's salads have good, green romaine lettuce which is of top priority when making or selecting a salad. Sometimes instead of the Baja Ensalada with Chicken, I ask for Grilled Shrimp! Other favorites include the grilled shrimp or veggie tacos (not on the menu, but they'll make 'em). The tortilla soup is good. Veggie Burrito or Nachos for when I'm feeling bad. And don't forget a good iced tea, my favorite (work-approved) lunchtime beverage of choice! \n\nAs with anywhere around this area, lunch time is crazy! Get here before 11:45 or call in your order! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Do you valet more often than not? Do people ever call you \""narcissistic\"" or \""pretentious\""? Do you go at lengths to be sure people know that you are the wealthier than they are? If you answered yes to any of those questions, Capital Grill is where you should eat lunch tomorrow. \n\nThe wait staff is friendly and they all have exotic accents, but you can tell their jobs aren't easy. \""I said pink in the middle! Not charred, not red. Pink, you imbecile! I knew we should've brunched at the country club, dear.\"" \n\nFood is good for those who can flip the bill but not nearly good enough to charge what they do. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I will NEVER go back. \nThis was my first visit and from the outside the building looks really old and it gives a feeling of history. I was excited for some delicious Italian food. The drinks tasted like sewer water and the manager didnt care one bit. We had both the Coke and Dr. Pepper and both were horrendous. I ordered the Chicken Parm (well done, and when i asked if it was well the server didnt even know) and was BEYOND disappointed. Its a grilled chicken breast, no flavoring, and they didnt trim off the fat or anything. The cook just threw it on the plate and covered it with their sour, nasty, gross tomato sauce and cheese. I have had this dish all over Phoenix, (Bucca de Beppo, Olive Garden, Carabas) the chicken for this dish is normally pounded flat, then breaded and either baked or fried. This Chicken Parm was the most simple thoughtless dish I have ever had! And at the tune of $11.95 they can keep it! The walls and ceiling were moldy and the service sucked. Smells like cat piss and I recommend you just go somewhere you know has good food and skip the \""history\"" and awful decor. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Joe's.  Meh.\n\nThere's always a cover here (sometimes going up to as much as they charge for nightclubs up in Chicago!  Wtf?), the line's always hella long, the floor's always really sticky/crunchy, the crowd's always really trashy/slutty (what can you expect with stripper poles on a stage by the dance floor?), the drinks are overpriced, and the place is always super packed.  So really, if this is what you're into, then you'd probably love it here, but it's just not for me.\n\nThe crowd you find that frequents Joe's consists of a lot of scantily clad sorority girls and collar popping frat guys.  If you can manage to maneuver your way through the sea of bodies in the hella hot and humid place and manage to secure a pool table, it can be alright with some friends and a beer.  They do have heating lamps and an outdoor area for if you need some fresh air from the stifling bar, but all in all, I would say Joe's is my least favorite bar on campus. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Showed up for a tour, but they had already finished for the day. Still one of the guys took us on a private tour. Started off with a free beer, had the Octoberfest. Very good beer. The guy was very informative and showed us the whole place. Answered some questions we had about beer also. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have never seen a better casebook for Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.\n\nSetting aside the garish atmosphere, the first thing that established the tone of the visit was a server who came within a minute after taking our drink orders and asked brusquely if we were ready to order.  Despite the fact that we were still poring over the menu he came again three more times before we'd finally set our menus aside.  Mind, the place was almost entirely empty and hours before closing time.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered Quesadilla Roha with ground beef and a special sauce.  The beef was utterly dry and flavorless.  The primary taste of her meal was the burned tortilla.  Accompanying it was a salad which consisted of shredded lettuce topped with a single, thick slice of under ripe tomato (totally inedible) and their 'special red sauce' which tasted like tomato paste with a bit of red pepper.\n\nI ordered the Burrito Loco which came with rice.  It came with enough rice for three meals and a burrito the size of my head.  The chicken inside was largely flavorless and there were some sizable bits of gristle inside.  The enormous quantity of rice was entirely unadorned in a large sticky pile.\n\nI ordered a Lime Margarita.  I wasn't asked how I'd like it prepared and it came with salt, but so little salt that there was barely a trace of it on one edge.  It was also very sweet, and I'm not sure whether there was any actual Tequila in it.\n\nWe shared a 'bean dip' which was sized for a party of eight, and was almost entirely cheese sauce with few discernible beans in it.\n\nAdding to the failure was that the food came out less than ten minutes after being ordered, which really highlights the fact that the food was almost certainly not cooked so much as reheated.  I would urge them to go INTO fast food if that's what they want to serve, but their beef compared unfavorably to Taco Bell and their Burrito was vastly less appetizing than any I've ever had at Chipotle, so I'm not sure there's room for them there either. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very poorly kept, poor selection of animals, all of which looked miserable and very dirty. There was not a single exhibit that I thought was well maintained with happy animals. The ground squirrels living near the zoo were more fun to watch than the actual animals in the zoo. They also make you pay extra for anything extra.  A regular ticket doesn't include much except walking around.  They would charge you extra to sneeze if they could. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Us airways is incompetent and unfit to call themselves an airline!  True story emergency landing and stuck in the airport for 4 hours with no answers!!! No one seems to know what's going on? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pretty disappointed. I was excited to try this place out for a late dinner, after reading all the previous reviews; just wanted to go and place a to-go order. Arrived at 9:35pm, and they told us the kitchen was closed. Most restaurants have to serve until their closing time (which was 10pm). Maybe it's just Chinese places that stop serving? I'm not sure. But I'm not used to walking into a place BEFORE they close and being sent away. They lost my business for good. I know I should have called beforehand. I normally wouldn't go to a restaurant that close to closing time, but when I do, they at least take my money! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  \""Been there - done that\"", with this discrepant racket.  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service, in a blatant word - SUCKS.  First, they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners.  That car washing cost me nearly $300.  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.  \n\nThen, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.  \n\nBut, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was \""For Sale\"" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was \""No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of.\""  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!   \n\nI know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.\n  \nCheck out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous!  Inexpensive.  Excellent customer service! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I took a date here for Valentines day and I must say that the food is GREAT! it has a really great feel to it. I  just wish I would have taken someone that did not piss and moan so much. lol. at least the food was good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow! I won't be going here. I called to ask a simple question about whether they carry an item and was treated like I was stupid because I don't know the details of their business or what kind of inventory they carry. If this is how they treat their potential customers on the phone I'm afraid I won't be one of them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Took me two years to get there, but loved the food, casual atmosphere. My wife does not like red sauces so she had the pasta with lemon cello (sp) with ham, very good. I loved the fresh pasta, ragu sauce of my dish. Excellent! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I bought a guitar online, but it needed to be set up (altered)--in particular, the action on it was too high. I brought it into Empire Music, which was my local neighborhood music store at the time. The guy who helped me--I wish I could recall his name--was nice and very helpful to me. But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument.\n\nI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon.\n\nMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers.\n\nSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I based my review on the pros and cons of the visit that I experienced.\n\nPros:\n1) AMAZING BREAKFAST.  There was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds.  The best part was the made-to-order grill.  Delicious omelets with fresh veges, french toast, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and actual eggs were all made fresh in front of your eyes.\n2) Well stocked gym.  It had many treadmills and ellipticals.  Free weights were also available which is kinda rare in hotels these days.\n3) Shuttle bus was free and the driver could take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius including the airport.  He was even kind enough to pick me up at the baseball stadium even though it was out of the operating range.\n\nCons:\n1) $5 / day parking fee.\n2) My room smelled like the guy before smoked in there\n3) The hot water in the shower took forever to heat up.  It was about 5 minutes, no joke.  I could've sworn the hotel ran out of hot water.\n4) The card key readers were finicky at best.  It took at least 3 tries before I was able to open my door.  Pulling it out at different speeds didn't matter\n5) The internet was also finicky.  First of all it was not free except for Hilton Gold and above members.  The internet wasn't fast and the connection would die quite often.  The wifi was so weak in the bedroom that I gave up trying to use it in there.\n6) Very little counter top space at the bathroom sink. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I haven't been to an Applebee's in years and years. Seriously, I usually eat locally. But I was in Phoenix with a friend and honestly didn't have the time or inclination to go to a local Phoenix establishment, especially when I was starving and ready to head back to Tucson.\n\nSo, Applebee's it was. And it was great! For two people the bill was about $36 and this include two meals for about $12 year, including my big bowl of spicy shrimp pasta. It came with some bread, and a big plate of onion rings and a delicious sauce- tasted like Jack Daniel's sauce. We finished it off with the little .99 cent brownie bites with ice cream- since I could barely move and was so full with delicious goodness it was a perfect size to finish off with. \n\nService was outstanding, ice tea refilled on a constant basis. Very very good! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been to this place for drinks and possibly food over a year ago. It was time to stop by for a casual dinner. I was eating light this night so ordered a salad which said : field greens, apple, berry, fresh mozzarella, and I added chicken. This dish was an embarrassment to salads. Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice. \n\nHusband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it. \n\nThis is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY. It is not memorable and there are too many other food places close by. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst place I have ever lived. No water half the time. No A/C the other time. The staff is here to make sure they get paid only and do not care about your problems.  I can't wait to move. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great Chicago hot dogs and beef!  Totally miss the Chandler location and don't get to Phoenix as often as I'd like.  I've had many things on the menu over the years.  Definitely worth a stop when you're in the neighborhood. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been here twice. Both times, I pulled up and sat waiting at the entrance, and some guy from the shop next door had to run over and notify someone of my presence. The second time I was actually backing out of the driveway to leave and the guy chased me down. \n\nIf you ask to have your wheels cleaned, the attendants use brushes on them. These same brushes are used on the exterior of your car. Car nuts have an adage of \""don't use on your wheels what you use on your paint\"" but we can forgo that for this review. My gripe here is that I ended up with scratches on my wheels. My car isn't anything to write home about so I'm not particularly worried about scratches in my paint, but if you have a newer/nicer car, I would look out for this. \n\nOne thing I like about this place (and a star redeemer) is that your car is hand dried at the end. Going along with that extra star is the fact that the people here are nice and aren't trying to screw you over; the quality of the wash could be better though. \n\nGo here, get the cheap wash, leave with a clean and dry car. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Extremely disappointed in this place... I brought my sister and a friend who were both in town from New York. Our waiter was full of inappropriate comments, starting with calling our male friend \""Hugh\"" and asking if he was looking for a third girl now that Kendra had left. He later told my sister she looked like Caroline Kennedy, which is NOT a compliment. (Smart woman, very nice, but definitely not a looker. Kennedy, not my sister.) I appreciate friendly, cheerful service, but not ill-thought conversation.\n\nWe started our meals with salads. The house dressing has a distinctive fishy taste, despite being told there were no anchovies in it. There were wilted pieces of lettuce on my plate, and the walnuts were not chopped making it difficult to pick up with a fork at the same time as any of the wilted lettuce.\n\nMy entree was equally as disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, generally a safe choice on a maiden voyage at an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, this time that was not the case. There were at least a dozen layers of lasagna noodles, making the dish very pasty. Between the layers there was barely any sauce, no discernable meat and zero cheese. I ate barely a quarter of it, yet now, three hours later, I still feel like there is a brick sitting in my stomach.\n\nMy sister ordered the veal parm, despite my story of being stared at by an adorable baby cow on the back of a dairy truck for ten miles in traffic one day. She soon regretted her choice as much as I regretted my lasagna. Mushy and bland, she also barely ate half her dish - and only a forkful of the greasy side dish of pasta served with it.\n\nOur friend ordered a shrimp and pasta dish, which he found adequate. He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn't feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.\n\nI finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).\n\nWe finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment. That in itself told us a lot.\n\nI know this place has been open since the '80s, but I'm not sure how. We won't be returning again. <|endoftext|>

Red chili is spicy but not overwhelming. The rice is tasty all by itself but mix it with their hot sauce and you'll have a party in your mouth! I ordered two beef tacos..two words, de lish! Hot pulled beef with lettuce and cheese and put the hot sauce on and you're in Mex food heaven! Bring your cash and your friends! This place will not disappoint you! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here for a filling after not having time to get it completed by my hometown dentist over Christmas break in early 2011. Not only was the filling $120 (no insurance), payment was demanded immediately upon exit, I also felt very disrespected by the office as a whole. The front staff is very curt and short. The gentleman who did my drilling had a patronizing and smart alleck attitude. When asking questions about the procedure he was doing, he mockingly imitated my voice (I am sorry I am not the most clear and articulate when I have a rod down my mouth getting a filling) to ask me what I said. He was very patronizing the whole time and unsympathetic to my legitimate worries I had seeing as this was the first time I went to a dentist other than the one I went to my entire life since childhood. I would never go back under any circumstance.\n\nEDIT: In my original review I stated this procedure was $250. The correct amount was actually $120. My apologies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Five stars.\n\nThe staff at the Royal Palms is so unbelievably helpful and courteous.  I'm not sure I'm the type you might expect to find at a resort like this, but I've never detected a whiff of attitude from anyone here.\n\nLast year, I reserved a \""Royal Romance Package\"" which included dinner and a room, complete with champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.  Our room was a large casita at the corner of the property, resulting in a very quiet and private experience.  Walking around the resort, you feel like you're really (as lame as it sounds typing this) in an \""oasis in the desert.\""  The other guests have those silly, serene looks stuck to their faces.  The staff is always smiling.  Everything just seems so...leisurely.\n\nDon't even get me started on T. Cook's.  The service and food are impeccable.  At first, the portions may seem a little smaller than you're used to, but the flavors more than make up for this.  I've eaten here a few times and the wait staff are always pleasant and conversational without intruding on our meal.\n\nMy fiance and I are currently planning our wedding here in the small, private Alegria garden.  The Royal Palms was the first and last place we toured; we just absolutely love this resort. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First review but not the first time here.\n\nOriginally came here because well I did enjoy the Van Buren location.  On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.\n\nUpon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.\n\nFirst things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area. \n\n*I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?\n\nPrice... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.\n\nOrdered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)\n\nMy girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)\n\nI will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.\n\nI never like to see a business fail. Especially one that has such a familiar name her in Phoenix. Best of luck to you guys. <|endoftext|>

We ordered \""The Super Six Pizza\"", which is sorta the combo they have....    As soon as I saw it I thought, Come here you little slice of heaven..spank, spank....     I think it was a little of everything that made this pizza for me...   The sauce was sweet and had a lot of tasty flavor.  The toppings were the perfect amount and you could actually taste all the different flavors of the meats while eating them.  The cheese was plentiful and the medium pizza for the two of us was more then enough.  You can really taste the love that was put into this pie.  I think it was the owner or chef, or both that came out and greeted everyone on the porch chit chatting with everyone to make it feel more homely.  \n**** Yes I think my search for a fabulous pizza is over with, I woke up the next morning craving it...  ****  Must return, and must return soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am reviewing the \""Day Spa\"" part of Boulder Falls Pet Resort & Day Spa.  Altho, please note that I have used, and will continue to exclusively use, their Pet Resort for boarding and doggie day care when I need it.  \nI have a 1 year old Australian Shepherd and he is absolutely crazy.  He is a smart dog, but his kryptonite is other dogs; all his manners go out the window and he just barks and jumps and wants to play with his 4-legged friends.  I took him to Boulder Falls today to get him shaved down due to lots of shedding. This was the first time I had used a dog groomer.  I was pretty nervous that he was going to be out of control for the groomer and he would come back 1/2 shaved, or nicked, or have a cut somewhere, or his coat would be completely uneven.  He was none of the above.  He looked great!!!  I can not give Boulder Falls' Day Spa anything but 5-stars because I know my dog, and I know he's a handful, and I know that they did a wonderful job shaving him and blending his head!  And to top it off, he was outside playing ball with the groomer before I came and got him! Lastly, the price (compared to a big chain pet store you have all heard of) is very reasonable! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came here to pick up my race packet for the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon. Paid $8 to park at an underground lot across the street because we couldn't find any metered parking.  I was immediately impressed by the food court at this convention center even though I didn't get to eat here. There was a coffee shop and a few other fast food joints with plenty of seats.  I just kept thinking how dinky the food cafeteria is at the LA convention center is compared to this place.  Packet pickup went smoothly.  There was no traffic coming in and out of the area. <|endoftext|>

No normal human being should ever need to go to the gas station as often as he does. That being said,  this gas station does not deserve a bad rating because my boyfriend is obsessed with them.  Truthfully, it is a nice gas station.  It's clean.  The service is always quick,  and the gas prices are usually reasonable compared to the competition. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is truly hit and miss... The breakfast is best here like many other reviews say here the drive thru is rediculously laid out while I've never encountered rude staff here I gotta say it's only selling point is the location,being 2 stories, and the piano is awesome but it is mcdonalds keep in mind so the food can only be so good even if it's hot and \""fresh\"" \n\nEat here at your own risk and since they close at midnight this isn't a drunk food spot <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had been planning on getting a complete car detail, somewhere, and was still reading reviews on where to go, but needed a quick wash in the meantime, so I stopped by Dannys. The Dannys salesperson, Jorge, presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included \""we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now, and come back for the detail when you have time. The price started high, then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined. Finally came down to the \""I give you good deal if you do it now, includes complete interior and exterior wash, engine clean, and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork\"". Out of exhaustion, sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me, vacuum people waiting ahead of me, and really needing the detail anyway, I gave in, signed the form, gave them my credit card, used my \""free\"" quick wash and was on my way. (average job on the wash then, btw.) \nPart 2- \nFinally scheduled and went in for my detail. Upon arrival the \""greeter\"" promptly looked in my window, read the damn \""need oil change\"" service reminder that's been glaring at me for a few hundred miles, and suckered me in to that service too. (whatever- convenience to me). I explained I was there for my detail, They popped the hood, Jorge (again) said I he had given me a good deal but didn't I want the engine cleaned too? I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal, but apparently since he hadn't circled it, it wasn't really included. Jorge says \""I can't give that for free, you'd have to talk to the manager\"". When I asked for the managers name, he seemed surprised that I would actually do it, so I did. The manager \""Alex\"", was actually quite nice, gave me the engine detail, apologized and said he told Jorge to not push the sale so hard in the future. I was told 2.5- 3 hrs and I would get a call when it was done. So 4 hrs later, I call, find out it's done. Pay for the oil change, hunt down my car and someone w/ the keys. So-overall results, looked all bright and shiny at first, but they just gooped on extra armorall on my leather seats, still had finger smudges on the interior of the sun roof, white spots where the wax had not been rubbed off, small scratches that I'm pretty sure would have come out anywhere else. The kicker was on the inside of the windshield there were 2 spots where parking permits had left a residue (one with part of the paper liner still attached) and they didn't do ANYTHING to try to remove ANY of it. I drove away, again exhausted and vowing to write my first ever negative yelp review. Sorry for the long review, but I hope it helps someone save the time, money and energy. Good Luck! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The owner is a total jerk0ff.  I have been in there so many times.  Each time he never comes by to ask how my meal was, yet he goes to other tables.  I am always in a suit so maybe he just doesnt like well dressed people (if you have seen the decor inside, you know what I mean).  It's dingy.  The food is ok---but the owner being a tool and not asking how everything was even once in 8 recent trips made me decide I will never come back ever. he is an idiot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Mt. Lebanon Saloon is such a happy hangout for my entire family. It's a perfect bar atmosphere with lots of aged dark wood and beer taps with fabulous selections lining both sides of the bar. There are plenty of TVs all around the bar and dining area - after all it is Pittsburgh! They offer up a big basket of popcorn (aka 'crack') as soon as you sit down. No one in our family can stop eating it until the basket is empty. \n\nThe wings are delicious and I wish I could say my favorite buffalo chicken sandwich was also still a delight but the last time I had it, somebody messed with the recipe and not in a good way. I sincerely hope this was a fluke and they bring back the old buffalo chicken sandwich.......please! \n\nThere's a wide array of burgers, hoagies and sandwiches to choose from on the menu that range from good to really good. It's bar food not fine dining but its always fun in there and the beer selection and atmosphere rocks!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  RIB TIPS didnt have taste <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Potato salad not good at all. Beans not good at all. Ribs were really pink and when its pork I rather be safe than sorry. U ordered garlic bread and that was a joke ! How can u mess up garlic bread cmon guys ! Youll never see me there again but u can catch at honey bears tho ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In my opinion, this is the best distributor in the city. The people running it are great, the selection is very good, and the prices are competitive with almost any other place I've been to. Because I'm not too picky, I typically have been stopping right at the front to buy the discounted brew that's usually out of season. You can't beat buying a case for $12.99. I'll continue to go here for my beer needs until I leave the city. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a small restaurant, but the food there serve is actually very good, far better than what i thought i would get.  The plus side is that it's an actual Restuarant not one is the chain things they have in abundance or here. And what that means is that the food is all made to order and nor just heated up. \nThe prices are fair and service is always fast, while the service is not exactly memorable or is still friendly, and overall pretty good. It's not too far from home so for me that's a plus. There's only a small handful of restaurants that are close to me, and this is one of maybe three thati go to on a regular basis.   The rest are not really worth mentioning much less actually go to.  It is with checking out though <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \n\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\n\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had a drive for a fast food and decided to stop here. Nothing more, nothing else. Whopper was good. They have a new soda machine - fun to play with <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well what is to be said about this place, for starter in just moving into Charlotte many of my coworkers and friends have recommend this place saying its some of the best Chinese food in town. As a food Connoisseur I enjoy Chinese food a lot but upon having high hope for finding a new place to enjoy some delicious cuisine the lack luster effort has seized to impress my expectations. The quality of the food has ranged from okay to mediocre, while the portions range can differ upon a full meal for an adult to \""emergency rations\"" that in turn causes the meal to become inconsistent and make not worth it's full price. It also seems that the cook doesn't put care into his work often times making the experience to be a let down and it seems to be the same at the all of the locations. My final verdict is poor, this place has a lot of work for improvement. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent, excellent food! Very reasonable also. I would highly recommend to give this place a try. I had the veggie eggs Benedict on an English muffin. Fantastic! They offer dishes like salmon omlettes, salmon eggs Benedict, etc. Very good quality for an airport diner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've had cats and dogs treated here and have always found the staff to be caring and professional.  Dr. Ryan, in particular, is a kind, warm person whose love for animals is obvious.  I would recommend her to anyone.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that, on one occasion I watched the front desk receptionist make a woman feel guilty because she opted against a recommended treatment due to the cost.  I'm sure the pet owner didn't feel great about the fact she couldn't afford the care - there was no need to make her feel worse.  I've heard this is done at many vets, sadly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is by far the worst airport ever. We have went to 3 different food place to eat and have had a bad experience at all of them. The first one took over  an hour tonget our drink order then came back and said oh you have 5 minutes to order I said ok I'll take this sandwich \""oh we don't have it or this or this \"" that was a larger portion of the menu so we said well I guess we are not eating here finished our drinks had to go ask for the check and meantime I saw our server dig in the trash for silverware and not wash his hands before grabbing food! The bk and taco place was also awful workers seemed extremely rude and bk took 15 min but the food was right there the whole time. Just don't eat here stay away avoid at all cost ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My wife and I had lunch here yesterday. The food was so salty it was almost inedible. Expensive sodium! Don't bother. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My six-year-old persian got into my mum plant and had stomach poisoning. Dr. Bart gave him fluids under the skin an oral prescription antibiotic and a bland diet and after two days he was good as new and happy. A few days later she gave us a call to make sure that he was okay Dr. Bart  really goes above and beyond and has always been a fantastic vet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat.  Stopped by Fiori's, haven't been there in years.  Yes, it was crowded but got a table and ordered pizza and wings.  \n\nThe pizza was hard to chew the crust was hard, the cheese was too!  The pizza was just sweet without much other taste, almost like ketchup!  Definitely not a fan of sweet pizza...I don't know why it is so popular but most people tend to like sweet food and drinks...but not me...I want some flavors and spice!\n\nThe wings were so average....not anything I would order again....my son ate one and said he was done...amazing!\n\nI know! I know! this place is popular, but it is just is not for me! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Our neighborhood, locally-owned sushi place and NOT a chain (as someone suggested in another review). I had to weigh in because we have been going to Ichi Ban for 7 years and the owner, Seth, and his staff have been consistent, attentive and friendly. And the sushi is fresh, creative and tasty in my opinion. Order something off the \""specials\"" menu posted on the wall and you can't go wrong with the spicy tuna. It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers. Great sushi place for lunch or dinner and right on the light rail. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to Desert Valley to get an Upper GI screen. I got lost on the way (dang google maps), I called and the receptionist gave me great directions. \n\nThe test itself is pretty gross, you have to drink Barium and roll around like a guinea pig while they xray your stomach. The nurse and the xray tech were both really nice and friendly and explained everything along the way. \n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you have to get a GI screen, I would recommend Desert Valley. The staff was polite and professional and made me an uncomfortable experience almost pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cute little diner right in the middle of the neighborhood. Stopped here real quick before taking my sister to the airport. We each had a biscuit sandwich: she had the chicken and biscuit with bacon, cheese, and gravy and it was great and I had the one with chicken, honey, mustard, and pickles and it was excellent.  2 sandwiches and a coke to split was $21. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A terrible HH!! We brought 20 people for a pre-homecoming party... All purchased alcoholic beverages- some ppl multiple beverages .. Food consisted of three banquet trays( one nacho, one enchilada, one chingalinga) HH was suppose to last until 6.30 food stopped at 5.45. Servers kept pushing he expensive stuff . We will head somewhere else with our dollars .. Great example of sad hour ... Nothing happy her <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tucked away nicely in a strip mall across the street from Paradise Valley Mall, its' almost hidden door keeps out most of the riff-raff.    So, what you end up with is a solid neighborhood bar in a pretty nice area.    Large, enclosed smoking patio for those so inclined, fair drink prices, assorted board and table games, the largest Jenga game I've ever seen, darts and especially Golden Tee. All of these things add up to a pretty decent place to go while away a couple of hours. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I caved and am jumping on the That's-Rentertainment-Is-Awesome bandwagon.  Seeing as renting movies from the dorms/library is free, I thought actually paying to rent a movie was lame, but when I had the sudden urge to watch My Neighbor Totoro and was unable to find it within the limited selections of the university, I trekked over to try my luck at That's Rentertainment.  Lo and behold, Totoro!!  Not only that, they have Hiyao Myazaki's other films like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Castle in the Sky!!  Just perusing through their shelves, I saw about a dozen other movies I wanted to watch as well (just in time for finals, w00t). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local. Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palate.\n\nI can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's. Fresh vegetables, grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk. Instead, their food is BLAND. It is the inverse of food, it is anti-food, annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. I love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. I have only been to (C)Ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when Pittsburgh's finest come out to play. Never a dull moment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Aside for the enthusiasm that the owner has for the store that place was complete crap. \nI ordered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread and salad. the salad was bag greens and 3 cherry tomatoes with a little tiny packet of ranch.\nThe spaghetti was overcooked in a half inch of water, the sauce had no flavor once so ever, and it came with one, smaller than a cue ball, meatball, almost flavorless meatball. more like a mush ball\nThe garlic bread was awesome\n\nI also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner. I opened it just to put on my pasta because it had no flavor. I don't even think I'm going to eat the pesto as it wasn't that good either. \nThere was what appears to be a homeless man rubbing through the trash looking for food. He was more than happy to eat my leftovers that I was unhappy with. \n\nPerhaps next time I should get a sub.\n\nThe pesto was tossed out after the weekend...99 percent full. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fiance bought my engagement ring here and my girlfriend swears by this place. I do now as well. I love my ring and love the service. I brought in some old pieces to be fixed and they did it so quickly and extremely well. They have a great selection so of course its always fun to poke around. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The staff at this Safeway is tremendous! Prices fluctuate from \""pricey\"" (like $3.79 for a half gallon of TruMoo Chocolate Milk) to \""fantastic\"" (like the 6 top sirloins for $15.60), but the cleanliness, spacious layout and the staff make up for it. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well let me start off by saying that when you first wall in the place it smells like sewer!\nThe lady at the counter is also the lady making the pizza , how do I know this well her hands were full of white cheese (the older lady very nice but not so clean) and when I got my Debit card back it stuck like cheese!!  Gross I will not be going there again.  I hope she washes her hands before making the Pizza.  This is the Pizza Hut on 7th st and union hills. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Employees are friendly and helpful since this was my first time here. However, I'm writing this review as I'm so bored after waiting for over an hour for my car to be washed and serviced. I will finish this when I get my car back!\n\nSo I just ended up going inside to check on my car, and it has been done for who knows how long. The guy who originally took my car said he would call me when it was done. Obviously that didn't happen since my car was finished and I was waiting for nothing. I read the other reviews while I waited, an they weren't very good. Hmm...I'm not swearing this place off some I live down the street, but I will definitely be more prepared. Remember: watch for your car, don't get huddled to fix scratches on your car, go on Tues, Wed, Thur for an oil change---you get a free wash. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hyatt's has two extremely strong reasons why you should shop there: Selection and Service.   They have the best selection of firearms, east of the Mississippi river.   And the level of service is unmatched.   There are several \""experienced\"" gunsmiths on duty every day and if you need something fixed, it can usually be done while you wait.  The staff knows firearms and won't BS you.  The prices are higher than online, however they will accept a reasonable offer.   And if you are not happy, they will make it right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After talking about the New Times in the forums, I thought I should probably bring my opinion here!\n\nI used to read the New Times regularly and really enjoyed their articles. I ate up their stories on Arpaio and other political subjects.\n\nBut then a group I'm part of was the subject of a really deceptive column, and I learned an acquaintance of mine had a feature article written about her in which they completely fabricated some quotes, and then there's the whole 'April Fool's' fiasco with the article on the chef who prepared endangered species...\n\nAnyway, bottom line is that the New Times is here to provide entertainment at their subjects' expense, and very rarely provide news. I still read it sometimes for a laugh or to check out event listings, but that's about it. I'm sure there's stellar information in here every so often, but I'd rather not wade through the bullshit to find it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I adored Uptown Coffee as a middle- and high-school student, mostly due to its proximity to the school.  It is a great, mellow place to hang out for hours.  Their drinks and desserts are always delicious, and they used to serve sandwiches.  They seem to have gone through a makeover since I graduated, and now it is much better lit, though the much-beloved couch is no longer.\nUptown Coffee is a great alternative to Starbucks and a great place to spend a few hours catching up with friends. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My experience today at Sun Devil auto. Was remarkably wonderful. I started this morning looking for a auto shop to help me with the truck. In my third stop was the Sun Devil auto shop. I am mediately was acknowledged. By the staff. Mr Francisco Torres, ask me what brought me in. I asked if they do a diagnostic in the truck. I also ask him you can do a check on the breaks well I have the truck and the shop. . \n\nI am mediately felt like I made the right choice. The extra care and attention was absolutely high quality coming from the staff member. Mr Francisco into step by step in show me every detail that I needed to know what kind of work the truck need it. I really appreciated that. Mr Francisco is very honest and not making an upsell. I make sure that I was driving safely on the road with a safe vehicle I will definitely keep my interest in the shop for as long as I live here in Arizona. I recommend this shop to all my friends and family honesty is the best policy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!\n\nWe went to Harris Grill for lunch, we ordered some entree and calamari for appetizer. It was calamari on top of some salad with Thai chili sauce dressing. Just when we almost finished the calamari, I found one entire cigaret in the salad. CIGARET!!!! I have no idea how a cigaret can be in the salad. IT IS JUST DISGUSTING. We left without having the resting of the food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went there again for breakfast recently and I'm afraid that I must downgrade my rating.  We were in line to order and only had two people ahead of us, one of the LGO girls approached us and recommended that we go outside and place our order with the barrista (AKA coffee lady) because it would be 'faster'.  So we did and ended up waiting for another almost 10 mins just to place our order.  Maybe she meant it would piss me off 'faster'.  \n\nThe breakfast I received was barely room temperature.  The eggs were supposed to be accompanied with avocado which (technically) I suppose they were, however, I assumed that this meant more than 3 dice sized pieces of avocado.  I felt like Gulliver; was I growing or was my food just getting smaller?  \n\nI asked one of the girls who work at LGO if the three ultra-mini cubes of avocado was considered to be a normal portion, she just looked at me like she was coming down off a pot binge and said she wasn't sure and that if I was 'OK with it', I should just go ahead and eat it.  Duh...ya think?  I'm thinking she didn't quite make the cut when they were recruiting at NASA.   Then I went to the guy at the pizza oven and showed him my mini food and he just laughed out loud and asked someone to throw some more avocado on my plate.  Anyway, I finally ate my now almost cold and fairly flavorless breakfast and must say that LGO seems to be resting on its laurels.  The food quality is just so-so.  \n\nI think this place is just another case of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' with people thinking 'Everybody else is in orgasmic rapture over this place, I guess that means that I should be too'.  Well, I'm here to say that the emperor is buck naked. <|endoftext|>

They talked with me, made me feel comfortable and didn't pressure me into high $ frames or lens upgrades.\n\nThey have a decent selection of frames, the office is comfortable, and the people are nice. \n\nThere IS an elevator, if you can't do stairs. It's to the left as you look at the building. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I just had to chime in with Dave to balance out the ratings on this place. It was some of the boringest (is that a word), blandest pizza ever. I've had better frozen pizzas.\n\nNot only that, the one time I ate there, the dining room was cold as the Grinch's heart, and there was a REALLY-LOUD-TALKING lady there, whose voice boomed throughout the entire establishment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The Teeter House is a trip, like no other. I was drinking with a couple of newly met friends next door at Rose and Crown and they wanted to go here to check it out, so I was a good sport about it. We tried sitting at the \""bar\"" but the owner said we cant sit there, because thats the managers seat..... eh? I was definitely surprised to notice they have a full bar, but all the other aspects were very very odd. The plants in the bath tub, the victorian old lady wallpaper, and the same dining room table seats my parents had growing up in the 80's. Maybe it's my generation, but this place did NOT appeal to me whatsoever, and who tells their customers they aren't allowed to sit at the bar? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went there with my girlfriend on Friday night and had a pretty underwhelming experience. To start with, service was far too leisurely. Our server disappeared for ten minutes between every interaction right up until the final twenty minute wait to get our bill. The decor and vibe was a little uptight and there was no music. The lack of music and the half-filled restaurant set the stage for periods of awkward silence that made me yearn for the cool vibrant atmosphere of a Houston's. \n\nHere are the dishes we ordered with a small commentary and star ranking.\nGrilled Artichoke - Swimming in oil and just tasted of grilled olive oil *\nVeal Osso Buco - The veal is not bad but it was served with bland rice pilaf **\nLamb Shank - Not bad; tender braised lamb and onions on some bland spaghetti***\nSpaghetti Bolognese - The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce tasted good but the pool of oil on the bottom of the plate made for an unappetizing finish. ***\nEscargot - They tasted fine but they just seemed old-fashioned. They tasted just like the garlic butter escargot I had on a cruise ship in 1988. ** <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Negative, droning on and on about negative things....yes, Arizona is full of negative news - but it serves no purpose to report it.  I have never heard such negative news reporting in my life.  Yuck. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, there's good bad-food and there's bad bad-food -- this is the worst of bad-food.  The lowest quality food possible.  While I like a good greasy spoon diner, this place is just horrible.  Absolutely gross.  Gave them the benefit of the doubt and went twice, but it's a thumbs down from me.  If you're 20 and very drunk at 3 a.m. -- maybe; otherwise, stay away and keep an artery open. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Probably my least favorite major west coast Airport because of its lack of amenities, long waits on the runway, always using US Airways here and I feel like this place has the most planes being shut down with service problems than any other airport around. (I understand heat is an issue) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Going back to LaGrande today to buy their famous English Muffins to take to family in Texas. Know that this place is very busy, but the food is certainly worth the wait. I especially like purusing their gift and foodie department!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been coming to Eastwind since it was Tokyo Express years ago.  I love this place although I never eat the sushi.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We used to go to Taylor Cafe all the time, but haven't been in a while.  Man, what a difference- and not in a good way.\n\nIt is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience, so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe.  There were several less than pleasant surprises.  First off, they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  That was a minor issue for us, but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch.  I ordered a cup of coffee, some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler, and we looked at the menu.  \n\nIt seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items.  I loved the eggs benedict before, and ordered it again.  My husband ordered the crepes.  We anticipated our meals.\n\nMy daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds.  Shocked, I saw it wasn't just eggs, but hashbrowns and fruit.  It was also NOT warm.  That surprise was a $9 meal.\n\nWhile waiting for our meal, I drank most of my coffee.  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup.  He took my cup, which I though was odd, and brought it back with warm, steaming coffee.  Yay!  Upon getting the bill, I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup.  \n\nLastly, our food was delivered.  My eggs benedict was not warm...again!  What is with cool food?  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce, and honestly, it just wasn't that tasty.  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad, but not flavorful.  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast, we were less than pleased.\n\nThe only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best.  \n\nWe will not go back.  This was just one disappointment after another. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've flown out of this airport for quite a while now, since I have lived in Phoenix for several years, and I have to say, its quite a nice airport.  Sky Harbor has three Terminals, (terminal 2, 3 and 4) but it seems that most people fly out of Terminal 3 and 4...well, at least I have.  Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had really positive experiences picking them up as well.\n\nMy most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.  Security was easy, and off to my flight I went.  Plenty of places to eat and hang out in here, plus you get free wifi at the airport!  I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.\n\nI also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security area.  Makes waiting for a flight much easier, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.\n\nThere's also rental car counters in here as well, who will help you get into a vehicle when you arrive.  love it!\n\nBaggage claim here is quick.  I mean, its FAST.  Be prepared to get off your flight and go directly to get your bags, otherwise your gonna be late getting them!  Also, there's plenty of ground transportation here, so you can grab a taxi, super shuttle or what not to get a ride home in case you do not have one.  \n\nEven though I have never used it, there's also plenty of on and off site parking here as well.  Off site is obviously cheaper, and most of the spots have coupons along with regular shuttles to and from the lots to the terminals.  I also like how the light rail connects to Sky Harbor as well.\n\nLove you sky harbor, keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> More than just a high end grocery store!\n\nSince they also do catering they have a full line of food you can take home, or carry out to the shaded patio area to enjoy.\n\nThey have a top notch salad bar and desert counter, as well as everything from appetizers, sushi and entr\u00e9es.  Be sure to walk around the store because in the opposite end of the store is a real brick oven pizzeria, as well as other italian delights.\n\nA good place for an impromptu lunch, and to pick up those few items you need at the grocery store. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Don't go here on a busy day, which is whenever the dbacks or suns play. You will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold. Then when you complain they blame it on being busy and make you feel like an idiot. The owner sits drinking instead of helping out and basically tells customers to shut up and stop whining!\n\n***Reply to \""owners\"" comment****\n\nJason, \nMaybe you should get YOUR facts straight before posting a reply.  We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was.  Your manager walked over with our ticket and said \"" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food\"" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied \"" well we're busy and short-handed\"" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game.  Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink.  Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses.  We did NOT demand to speak to the owner.  He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner.  She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,\"" I just saw him\"", your manager then said \"" I'll go get the owner for you.\"" There was no demanding there.  Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining.  The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back.  Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped.  We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken.   Get your facts straight before coming on here and calling people LIARS.... Maybe if your bartender would have been a little more personable and offered an apology or something in the first place this whole situation would have been remedied. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I didn't like this place.\n\nFirst, the service is slow.\nSecond, the food is not that good.\n\nGyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy! I don't wanna talk about fries...\n\nSo, this place is so overrated! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> my son and I just ordered delivery from this place because we got a pamphlet and the door, we ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the kung pao extra spicy!!! fantastic the only reason not a five star not enough sauce on the sweet and sour next time going to ask for an extra side! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not impressed at all.  I went with my husband, and as always he ordered a bean burrito, it was very bland and way over priced.  I had a chicken and a beef taco, the chicken was horrible, and the beef was very dry.  For desert we ordered apple chimichangas which were very good, but how could you mess up deep fried apples and tortillas dipped in cinammon and sugar.  The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first, either way, no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good.   I would never go here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They serve Lux coffee! Definitely a good idea to have a place like this to hold you over until you can have pizza. And the art work in here has always been really good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been to the Gelato Spot next-door countless times, but for some reason I never stepped in here.\n\nI have been missing out!!\n\nWhen I walked in at 2pm, all the tables were full but there was no line at the counter. The cheerful barista asked what she could get for me and when I said I wasn't sure, she not only told me to take my time, but pulled out laminated sheets listing their syrups and teas. That intuitive customer service set things off right from the get-go. I noticed they had one of my favorite (yet hard to come-by) flavors- praline, and ordered a decaf iced praline latte. The barista made the drink quickly, in spite of her accidental initial pull of regular espresso, which she noticed right away and fixed. She also asked my milk preference which I liked because let's face it girls, some days are skim days and others are 2% days and it helps to have someone remind me of that. :)\n\nThe latte was satisfying. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was made well and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the lattes they usually serve at Starbucks (this coming from a sugar fanatic!). The pitcher of water and water cups they have out with the cream and sugar is a nice touch that I'd like to see in every coffee shop. \n\nThe decor is sort of rustic with burlap coffee sacks above the door and local art on the walls. The atmosphere, which can't really be pinned down to one thing, is welcoming and relaxed and I felt like I could hide away for hours there. \n\nThere were a few negatives. The first was the mess of a baked goods display. I'm sure it looked great at opening, but by the time I was there, it was disheveled, half empty and didn't look like it had been tidied up all day. Typically I ignore the food offerings at coffee-shops, but I skipped lunch today and could have been persuaded to drop a few dollars if I'd seen anything remotely interesting. The other thing is that they have a drink refrigerator containing water bottles, juices and other bottled drinks for sale. It's so loud!! It cycles on and off, but when it's on, it can be pretty distracting. \n\nI will definitely come back to this place, especially as the weather improves and all the outdoor seating becomes a viable option. Now I just need to silence those evil thoughts that tell me it's acceptable to get a gelato within the same hour as getting a sugary latte... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying \""I don't have time to talk to him \"" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl,Antibiotic and Morphine !!! Both me and my husband strongly disagree because she's a little baby and just because she is screaming her lungs out and has severe skin flares ups does not mean she needs morphine!!!! We were transfer to Levine and the doctor there was also shocked when we told him they were gonna give her morphine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I took my Fender Hot Rod Deville 4x10 tube amp into Ziggie's for repair on a serious noisy buzz coming loudly through the speakers (even louder than the guitar signal!) Before taking it in, I did everything in my ability to troubleshoot the issue on my own (I am very poor, you see). I had recently replaced the tubes (carefully, with the help of a professional), the buzz dd not improve, so having heard good reviews, Ziggie's was my next resort. \n\nThe repairman at Ziggie's was very kind, and knowledgeable. He assured me that it probably wasn't the new tubes I had installed (woo!) and that there was probably some short inside the circuitry of the amp. He had the amp for a three whole weeks (I had other options for live gigs luckily) and when I got it back, the amp was as good as new. The grand total was a $60. I sighed with relief, expecting the charge to be much higher. I'll most likely visit Ziggie's again with my next inevitable musical instrument problem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had a horrible experience getting take out from the local PF Changs take out. I had been home and not feeling well the last couple of days craving take out from PF Chang's. I found it the worst food I have ever gotten at from PF Changs in 2 states in the last 10 years. The gallon of \""fresh\"" tea was so syrupy I could not drink it. The vegetarian dish had soggy vegetables and awful tasting curry that I could not eat it. The side order of fried green beans was soft, soggy, and very cold with a poorly made fish sauce on the side. I could not eat any of it and I spent a small fortune ordering for my family. I would have returned it for a reorder, however I have been getting over an illness and not able to drive. My daughter who picked it up had to leave. What happened to this restaurant? It was an awful dining experience and I do expect some type of reparation for this terrible eating experience. I ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead. Just awful!\n\nTo add insult to injury, this is the same restaurant where I found that the wait staff would pocket the change from the bill when paid with cash. I let this pass the first time and the 2nd time I asked the manager if this was their policy, with an embarrassed looks from the nearby wait staff. \n\nI used to absolutely love this chain, however it has become a poor excuse for a restaurant. I wrote the main office <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  HANDS DOWN WORST SAFEWAY IN PHX!!!! It is the closest grocer to my home. OMG, Can I ever go there with out the lines going down the aisles!!! Never enough people working, ALWAYS 1-2 CASHIERS each time I have ever gone there. Littered with trash and filth. I would like to not be asked for $$ one time before walking in by the panhandlers of the day. This needs to be addressed, it shoudl not matter that the store is in downtown Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went there last year after watching the Suns game. Terrible food. Terrible service. Really cool inside, they have some awesome stuff. Its clean and the musician was bada$$. But I ordered a burger well done with no pink. It came out so pink it was almost bloody. I complained and the waiter was arguing with me that its still good. I reminded him the customer is always right. He returned with a new burger just as bad. Also only had 1 refill the whole time I was there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 1/2 slab and pork shoulder with sugar fried biscuits and garlic mashed potatoes. We need one of these in Philadelphia. The BBQ was so tender and flavorful.  Sides were good but not as amazing as the meat. Will definitely be back to try the brisket before I head back east. The restaurant itself is small and cramped but the food is worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Royal Palms - such memories!  My wedding reception was at Royal Palms almost 10 years ago...if I could have Yelped then it would have definitely been 5 Stars.  Have stayed many times over the years and have always enjoyed returning to this special place...I would classify all as 4-5 star caliber visits.  The property remains beautiful and the location can't be beat.  Most recently returned for my wife's birthday this past weekend.  It was once again a terrific weekend, but there's clearly room for improvement.\n\nPro:\n1. Beautiful property - perfect location\n2. Great room (designer casita #118)\n3. Good service\n4. \""Surprise\"" birthday dessert in room was a nice touch\n\nCon:\n1. Time to jazz up the pool area: one poor server running around like a chicken sans head does not make for a relaxing environment...and the little shack of a bar does not exude opulence.  Try to be more like a miniature version of the Scottsdale Four Seasons Pool area.\n2. T'Cookes has not recaptured it's mojo from the glory years gone by - good service and food, but it used to be head and shoulders above typical resort fare.  (this could be another review if I had time).  \n3. They ran out of souvineer coffee mugs - this in and of itself is no big deal, in fact they gave us a token discount on a set removed from a room.  This would have been much more appreciated if we didn't find coffee residue in the mugs when we got home.  Not the end of the world, but annoying nevertheless.  \n4. $25 \""Resort Fee\"" is irritating.  These nickel-dime charges and fees everywhere you turn these days are really getting out-of-control.  I'd rather pay the advertised price and take care of my own tips and such.  \n\nOverall, I'd say 3.5...rounding down in this case.\n\n**************************\n8/24: Updating from original 3 star level.  After reflecting on all the hapiness that Royal Palms has brought into my life, I just can't leave this as 3 stars.  The place deserves four...kind of like a lifetime achievement award.  I wrote the original review the day after consuming 4 lemon drops by the RP pool, a Boodles martini and an Anchor Steam at the Jade bar, wine and Irish Coffee at dinner at T'Cooks, a bottle of Champagne in the room, and a bloody mary and another anchor steam at brunch the next morning at Dick's Hideaway.  My liver may have weighed in with 3 stars, but the resort really deserves 4. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here last night after an exhausting day taking care of a newborn. Thankfully my baby slept through our entire dinner despite how loud the place is. The decor is simple but spacious and the service is really good and fast. We were seated immediately (on a Saturday night! ) and were served water by the waitress right away. She was friendly and always nearby her customers. My husband had the Mediterranean omelet  (can't remember what It's called). It had feta cheese,  mushrooms and spinach with potatoes on the side and a biscuit.  It was so good I wanted to steal his plate.  I got the meatless meatloaf.  It was very filling and the gravy was good but the  portion was way too big. By the time we were done we had no room for the amazing looking cheesecake. I guess we will have to come back to try dessert.  Oh and the couple next to us ordered an ice cream Sundae, it was ridiculously huge and looked awesome. Good for sharing!  I definitely recommend this once for simple diner food done well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Blueberry pancakes were very bland.  No flavor at all.  Excellent service however. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There are some things that must be experienced in life to truly appreciate: your first kiss, your first fine dining experience, your first swap meet. \n\nPark 'n Swap didn't pop my swap meet cherry, but it did impress me enough to forget about my real first time in Tucson. PnS, situated near the greyhound park, is a sprawling mecca of bargains galore, tchotchkes, crazy crap and some pretty useless garbage. My BFF and I have a method: We case each aisle after we get a beer or two or 5, working our way to the back of the lot. About half way through, we usually stop for wings and fries from Long Wong's, get another beer, then finish off cruising the merchants. \n\nOn a side note, I'm hoping to return very soon to scout out a DVD copy of \""Teen Witch\"" so I can have a Top That event. \n\nMore than the good-to-great deals, the highlight of your visit to the PnS is people watching. Yes, Indoor Swap Meet used to have the Phony Pony Sisters (bah, where have they gone?), but PnS has such a plethora of Jerry Springer wannabes that it's worth twice--no, thrice!--the cost of admission. \n\nWith the light rail station right in front of PnS, it's going to be hard for me to find excuses as to why I cannot get my entertainment and morning drink on in one place. It's my Saturday and Sunday morning therapy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Definitely a great choice for some good southern food that isn't too expensive.  I use to frequent this restaurant almost weekly before relocating to Arizona.  I must say it's one of the main things I miss about living in Charlotte.  Have yet to find a place like it (especially in Arizona) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I enjoy going to any Marjele's. They have good drinks as well as good food which is something you can't say about every bar.\n\nThey also have various locations so if this Marjele's doesn't suit your taste, another might will. This Marjele's is smaller so if you don't want to be bombarded by an obnoxious crowded bar where you can barely move around then this must be your lucky day!\n\nIf you come for happy hour be prepared to pay for parking unless you're coming by another means or you know a secret free spot before the meters are free.\n\nI always enjoy the music at Marjele's and of course whatever game is on.  Marjele's has a nice vibe so if you haven't been or  you're looking for your next bar, you should definitely give Marjele's a shot ;) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.\n\nI have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered \""Traditional Vegetarian\"", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the \""Traditional Vegetarian\"". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.\n\nPlease, if you want pizza, do not come here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Maaaan, this place is tiny. Once you get past the fact that there's nine seats, and the griddle takes up about 30% of the building, you realize that this is one of those special little haunts that makes cities cool. It's totally off the beaten path, but just three blocks from First Friday mayhem. You could drive right by and never even notice it (I had about 15 times). \n\nInside it's surprisingly sparce, considering it's about 75 square feet. There's no AC, just a few well-placed fans on full blast. I went in the middle of the afternoon in July and felt pretty comfortable, especially considering the kitchen IS the place. \n\nAnd the food... you want greasy, delicious, messy, rich, heavenly sinful pig-out fare? What's that? You want it at dirt cheap prices and with friendly service? It's perfect. The cheeseburger is oozing cheddar, the fries are sliced about four seconds before they go into the fryer and they have french toast in a cup. Need I say more? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stayed here last night and had a large comfortable King bed in a very spacious King Suite for $149. You have control over how hot or cold you want the room. But don't look up at the ceiling if you want to see the popcorn. There's a fridge in the room.The hotel lobby and environs are lush with greenery and water features. They even have a happy hour as well. The pool looked inviting. They have free continental breakfast, although I left too early this morning to sample the breakfast. For being in the city, there is plenty of parking.\n\nThis hotel is near all of the action of the downtown where all the hip folks hang out and close enough to Scottsdale and all the spring training venues as well. This is a great staycation hotel. I just wish I had more time to explore the place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very pleased with these guys!  Locked ourselves out of the house & gave them a call.  They are just down the street so they arrived within 5 minutes of the call. He had us back in our house in no time.  The locksmith that helped us out was very polite and knowledgeable.  He even showed us we have a programmable doorknob, who knew?!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Decent music spot and great in nice weather to sit outside and have a beer.  But do not go there hungry, service trying to get something to eat is atrocious.  Haven't gone back in a year, too many other places with better service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'd give this company zero stars if it were an option. \n\nCarolina appliance was sent by out Best Buy Geek Squad protection plan to fix our brand new dryer when it started overheating and making a scratching noise. They came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem. They said they needed to order a part and would be back within 7 business days to install it. When two weeks go by, I called to check in. No one answered the phone during business hours. My husband called back later. Neither of our messages were returned. We called Best Buy who contacted them and requested they get in touch with us.  After about 15 phone calls from Best Buy, my husband, and myself, we just have up. Not one of these calls was ever returned and no one answers the phone during business hours so it is impossible to follow up. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!\n\nNow we are working with another Geek Squad recommended company but having problems since our dryer was under warranty and the company already paid for the part Carolina Appliance ordered for our dryer (and is apparently holding hostage). Not to mention, it will now be another week and a half or two weeks for the part to come in again - leaving us without a dryer for a month and a half. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Probably the least professional business I've ever worked with. Beware!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had such high hopes for this bakery when I moved into the neighborhood last year. I've made quite a few visits there and I think I will not be returning.\n\nFirst, the service. EVERY time I've gone, without fail, I have been put off by the service. There are usually 3 or 4 people behind the counter, just awkwardly STARING at you as you browse the baked goods. They either ignore you completely or try to rush you into choosing, either way I always leave feeling like my business inconvenienced and annoyed them. \n\nSecond, the food. Honestly, it's just not any good. At all. Cookies, bagels, muffins, pastries, bread...they are all pretty bad in quality and are WAY overpriced. I've gotten, and will continue to get, better quality products for way less at the Bashas bakery 2 doors down.\n\nToday was the last straw. The rather rude employees actually made comments to each other about another customer as soon as that person left the store. I couldn't even FINISH some of what we bought today which really says something. Never in my life have I ever left a sweet treat unfinished! And my loaf of \""fresh sourdough\"" was stale and completely tasteless. I have no clue how they've been in business so long, or how they've gotten so many glowing reviews. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We took a client to Hillstone for dinner. The place is beautiful and the service was great. The food was slightly better than bar food, but certainly not worth the prices they are charging. If you are an advocate of fine dinning: you will be sorely disappointed.  \n\nGo there for drinks, enjoy the gorgeous ambiance, but go somewhere else for a nice dinner.\n\nI had the Cod special of the day, thirty minutes after eating my stomach started feeling queazy and at 5am I was woken by uncontrollable......food poison symptoms! There were four other members of our party and their stomachs were fine, but they were not overly impressed with their meals. Everyone did enjoy the atmosphere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We've been coming to Flamingo Palace for years and they are always just as good as we remember. Even my kids love this place, when we give them a choice to go out anywhere Flamingo Palace is always on the list. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was looking for good comfort food in downtown Phoenix and that is exactly what you'll find at Welcome Diner. The staff was friendly, the environment was cozy and the food was too good to not finish! I can't wait to come back with a crowd to share such an experience! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Since when did EVERY restaurant (and grocery store) start closing for Christmas?  We couldn't cook food we didn't have so we looked for someone, anyone to cook for us and the only thing open was Denny's. \n\nPacked, 35 minutes for our food, order-to-table, the food was absolutely delicious. Really delicious. Rarely does the actual food TASTE like it looks, but this Denny's- on this day - did a fine job!\n\nLast, I was tempted to order a double cheeseburger. I didn't because I thought there's no way it'll be as good as the picture. But as we were leaving a large tray of food passed us by and, OH MY GOD!  The double cheeseburgers looked EXACTLY like the pics!  Big!  JUICY!!\n\nI'll be back. No greater compliment can be paid a restaurant, right? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stuck here for 3hrs on a layover.  What to do, what to do?  This airport is huge.  It seems to be the main hub for all flights in the southwest.  Stop off at the gift shop to scan the magazine racks.  OK, that keeps me busy for only 20 min.  What else to do?  Let's try to catch up on some reviews.  What's it gonna cost me to get online?  Hmmm...Sky Harbor Public WLAN?  Could it be?  YES!!!  FREE WI-FI!!!  Makes the layover that much more bearable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In Oct. my son that is at  UNCC had a nail in his tire. The person at Tire Kingdom told him he needed 3 new tires., THe car is dented and has over 151,000 miles on it.We told him to match the tread. Instead of giving him options of prices they put on$ 184.00 tires EAC on the vehicle. I called very upset the next morning and the manger said he would not give me an exchange nor would he give me any money off. He offered a 4th tire with a $70.00 rebate and would discount an oil change! This is taking advantage of a young consumer and  in my opinion a terrible way of doing business. I would NEVER recommend this company. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It is a beautiful church. While I am not a Catholic myself I attended service last Sunday and this Easter Sunday. Everyone seems nice there but I just don't particularly agree with the comment I heard about how noncatholics are not permitted to partake in communion which is the symbolic intake of the body and blood of Jesus. I believe that if a church isn't a place that a drug addict can feel welcome then it isn't a church. But if your a Catholic living in Phoenix it is a beautifully decorated church and seems to have good people. And during Lent they have the best fish fry in all or Arizona <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very very odd place. Will not be returning, extremely loud, forget having a conversation with anyone. We were by the front door and this stage on the other end of the bar, and still couldn't hear each other. \n\nDef a dive bar. Mostly men, keep a close eye on your wife or girlfriend. They'll be snatched if you're not careful. Lots of HOG members and other motorcycle clubs present. This crowd makes me somewhat nervous, and my husband is a 250lb biker. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great conversationalist, inexpensive and high quality hair cuts, wonderful old school atmosphere. No computers, no expensive hair products they're trying to hawk, just a man doing his craft. Every time I go there I'm so happy this place is still thriving. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to this place for a special occasion.  The waiter was noticeably trying to run the bill up.  I kept trying to keep the bill down.  It was a very strange experience.  The fish was ok but very salty.  I would not go back under any circumstances. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hands down my favorite burrito in the greater Pittsburgh region. The owner always remembers my order when I show up: beans and cheese with rice, size 'chico' (though there's nothing chico about it). It's flavorful, fresh, and filling. I also recommend the taco salad, and the tacos themselves. The only item I've had that was less than thrilling was the vegetarian quesadilla... a little heavy on the cheese. But the rest is so good that an average dish has no bearing on my overall rating. Eating here is a must. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Considering my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.\n\nAs you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right?\n\nThe people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That \""line\"" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.\n\nA night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! \n\nHeck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Decided to try on FRI 04MAY2012 - it was about 1:30PM and they close at 2PM; so, the expectations were not high; but, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the combination noodle soup; I really enjoyed it; but only thing would be do not put in soy sauce in the soup; it was a little dark for me, also wished they had BBQ Pork in the soup also.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place was really entertaining for breakfast.  It's a small spot tucked in next to a few other places but it definitely stands out inside.  Once you get inside you will notice 4 things: 1- there is a giant mural of hot air balloons, 2 - there is a giant mural of nyc complete with twin towers, 3 - the awesomely bad 80's restaurant decor, and 4 - the servers look like they are fresh from Jersey Shores.\n\nWe sat down and were immediately greeted by a server who is most likely a long lost relative of Snookie, hair bump, tan and all.  She was very sweet and responsive and didn't waste anyone's time.  She was also particularly patient with the douchey dad behind us who insisted his omelet be made in the most particular fashion.  I simply ordered a waffle with bacon.  FINALLY I can order just a waffle and bacon, and not a waffle with a side of bacon.  The waffle was great, super light and very crispy.  The bacon was pretty good.  It was thick cut and salty, but a little more done than I liked.  I could have asked for it to be done a specific way, so my fault.\n\nIn any event, I would like to come back here if we're around this area and I suggest you try it sometime. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is alright.. It not what you would expect from Starbucks though.  They are usually much more spacious and helpful.. The staff here is snippy and not friendly.  \n\nHey.. Free Wifi!!  Cant complain about that.. I am yelping from here right now.. But it makes me wanna go try Caribou Coffee.  Eh..\n\n-Ian M. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am NOT surprised that this store is the lowest rated in the area.\n\nExcuse me, I have a return.  It's unopened but I bought it more than thirty days ago.  I DO have the receipt and you still sell the product, Linksys router.\n\nMgr:  I'm sorry.  We do not take returns over 30 days.\n\nMe:  If I didn't show you the receipt, would you accept it?\n\nMgr  Yes, but you did show it to me.\n\nWay to go mgr, you got me there.  Took it to Frank Lloyd Wright store- they accepted it immediately and told me they didn't care when I bought it but, could only give me a store credit. \n\nGood job guys, got me for $1.75 in gas. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We're currently one third of the way through our lease and I cannot wait to move out of this place. The property looks nice enough and the grounds are well kept, but our experience here has been lackluster at best.\n\nThe staff is rude, for starters. They don't handle complaints in a gracious or timely fashion. We had an issue with a drawer in the kitchen that kept tipping in. They came out five times before I gave up on that. Yes, it sucks, but that's par for the course here. \n\nLast Monday, something caused a flood in the bathroom/hallway/kitchen area after hours. It took the on-call maintenance guy over an hour to arrive, and he couldn't find the source of the flood, which had thankfully stopped at this point. The carpet person arrived another ninety minutes later, ripped up the carpet, sucked up the water and set up a large fan. By Thursday, I was asking the office when they would be replacing said damaged carpet. They told me that they would just be cleaning it and not replacing it. They also said that I told them the source of the flood was the second bathroom's toilet (I did, really? It's good to know I live in Imagination Land.) On Friday, I went into the office again, and they told me they'd be out to clean it that day. Right around closing time, the carpet person's assistant showed up, removed the fan, and did no cleaning or tacking down of the carpet. He said he didn't know he was supposed to do those things and didn't have the materials to do so. Finally, eight days later, they have tacked down and cleaned the carpet, after much nagging by me. I have never had to work so hard to get basic service from an apartment complex.\n\nIn addition, they do not keep track of packages in the office consistently, and I have had mail go missing on more than one occasion.\n\nThey also roll water and sewer into your rent price. They recently raised this, so our rent went up, mid-lease. I am disturbed by the fact that they can change what we pay pretty much whenever they like.\n\nPros:\n- Close to shopping and grocery stores.\n- Easy to get in and out of.\n- Relatively quiet.\n\nCons:\n- Rude, non-responsive\n- Things don't get fixed properly.\n- Price may change.\n\nEDIT: The complex changed ownership at the end of my lease, so this review may be completely outdated at this point. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Some amazing bar food, trivia Wednesday and Thursday (I'm usually there Thursdays) and the karaoke is awesome. Great drink and food specials. I'm partial to their fish tacos (chipotle mayo, yum!). \n\nPS If you're good at trivia, come Wednesdays, since I'm there with my team on Thursdays ;) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This company said the odometer on my car at rental time was 16,900 when it wasn't. It was about 300 miles more. So their misrecording the odometer info made it impossible for me to use the option to drive my rental car less than 75 miles and pay only $13.99 for gas. I was forced to pre-pay for a full tank of gas, because otherwise they charge you $9 a gallon to fill the tank themselves. And of course, no credit for unused gas. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love getting a shave. Its a personal treat for myself that I try to get once every other month.  I've gone to this V's down the street from me about 4 times for a cut and shave and only twice have walked away happy and those were my first two visits and it just kept getting worse. \n\nTrying to get an appointment on Friday or the weekend is a wasted effort but then again so is trying to make one for any other time. I thought I knew the the drill with this place by now. Close at 6pm no shave appointments past 5pm all of which I can understand for a good cut and shave. \n\nSo today with my girlfriends birthday weekend around the corner I call in and make my appointment at 5pm for a cut and shave knowing full well I had a less than great experience on my last visit. But a boy has a right to dream I guess. I leave work early to be there at 5 mins early only to be told to sit and wait a half hour which sucks but its not the first time they have failed the appointment game for me thus the 5 mins early. But I think I'm getting my shave so I sit and wait my turn.\n\nAfter my wait they get me in the chair and give me the worst speed cut I've ever had. My scalp still stings 2 hours later from the buzzer being dragged through it. After the \""cut\"" the barber (if you want to call him that) asks \""Did you want a shave too?\"". Is it really that hard for someone to tell you up front they don't have time to give you a shave?\n\nI was kind of at a lost for words which wasn't a problem for him because he filled the silence with \""Cause I can buzz it off and save you a few bucks but we need to close our doors\"". Knowing that I have a full schedule till the weekend and thinking it couldn't be worse than me doing it myself I made the terrible mistake of letting him \""buzz it off\"" which is the equivalent of letting someone take an electric sander to your face. No oils, no soothing balm, no warm towel just some deep red scratches and a feeling of dejection. \n\nAll of this, my leaving work early 30 mins early, my wasted 30 mins waiting , my blitz of a hair cut and my 'not shave' with scars included cost me $31. Which is a $13 savings compared with my last visit. \n\nAnd that was and will be my last visit to V's Barbershop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  All UPS stores aren't created equally (they may have the same look 'n' feel, but they're individually owned). I've stopped in here a couple of times -- on one occasion the employee didn't seem to know how to work the copy machine, and on another occasion I discovered that this location doesn't do passport photos. On all occasions, this particular store has had an unkempt, cluttered appearance which seems unprofessional. The last time I was in here (which will be the last) I noticed the mailbox fees on the wall. Why someone would rent a mailbox at a UPS store instead of the much less expensive post office-option is beyond me. I also never got the impression of \""I'm happy to see you, customer! How can I help you??\""\n\nMy advice is to avoid this store. If you need UPS services, visit the UPS store on the SEC of Camelback & 32nd St. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't know much about cars but I do know that the people who work at Virginia Auto really care about their customers. Matt, especially, has gone above and beyond what was expected to help me out.\n\nLast week my car broke down on the side of the road in Austin, TX, and I had no one to help me. The road side assistance card I was given during my Groupon I had used a few months prior was expired and I had forgotten to get a new one. I called Matt and he stayed on the phone with me for over an hour trying to get a hold of someone to come and pick me up. He eventually found a truck to get me, free of charge, and then sent me the new road side assistance card the next day. \n\nHe knew that I was living in Austin and would probably never bring my car back to his shop for repairs but he still did everything he could to help me out. Anyone who would do that for a customer will always get my business and I letting my friends in Phoenix know about his great shop. \n\nThanks Matt! Keep up the great work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I recently moved to the area and registered with every dental staffing agency in the valley as a dental hygiene candidate looking for work.  My interview process here was very impersonal and could have been completed by email.  I was only asked a few simple questions.  I was also asked to bring a letter of recommendation to the meeting if I have one, and when I presented it to Gina she was very confused about why I would bring it.  She wouldn't make eye contact with me at that point and awkwardly set the letter aside.  Nothing about the hiring or temping process was explained to me at all, and after a month I've heard nothing from them, while other agencies have kept me busy with temping.  Gina had poor body language when interviewing me, and I left the office believing I would likely never hear back anyway.  It was upsetting because I connected VERY well with the other two staff members at the office while we waited for Gina to come to our meeting 15 minutes late.  I believe they are holding the office together.  But not contacting me is her loss, because I found a full time job very quickly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Blue features mediterranean style food and offers some unique options that I've not had before. The menu is pricey. Beautiful decor with a nice bar and jazz band playing. The dining room is very nice and feels like it should be pricey.\n\nWe've had great service every time we've been. The wait staff is helpful, knows the menu very well and has had some solid recommendations. The downside to Blue is that the food doesn't necessarily live up to the surroundings and the prices. I had the kobe beef on one occasion, which was very pricey, and found it to be absolutely awful. I've tried other more unique dishes like their Lamb Tagine which is slow cooked from 5am in the morning until served. I expected lots of great flavors and it was simply okay. My friend enjoyed the wild boar very much. My wife was very happy with the salmon. So the place can be great, it just depends on if you hit the right entree. We'll keep it on the list and hopefully they'll be more consistent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So... I would have posted pictures, but devoured everything before I could remember, lol. \n\nThe food is AMAZING! The service is great also. Salmon burger, french fries, apple crisps, regular burgers, and the list goes on! I haven't even told you the best part... THEY DELIVER!!!!! Unfortunately, this will be an overweight summer... but a happy one! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came here for a leisurely Friday lunch. The ambience, the food, the wine and the outdoor patio were all amazing! \n\nI had the Ranga Ranga Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand which was nicely chilled, crisp, light and a refreshing choice for sipping outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day.   \n\nWe chose the cheese board which was not the best I've ever had (although in all fairness I am a cheese snob!!) but definately good and I enjoyed the presentation and the different selection of breads served with it. We also ordered the bruschetta. It was hard narrowing it down to just four as I wanted to try them all. We settled on the following:\n\nRoasted red peppers & goat cheese - My least favorite of the 4. It was good but I would have preferred more goat cheese and less peppers\nFresh mozzarella w/ tomato & basil - Chewy bread, fresh tomatoes, ample basil, yum! \nSmoked salmon w/ pesto & capers - Salmon was fresh, lots of capers, another yum!\nTomato jam & fresh sheeps milk - my absolute favorite! I had to remind myself to share. \n\nAn overall great experience.  I can't wait to return so I can try the rest of the bruschettas! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I thought I'd avoid the crowd by dining a little late but the place was PACKED! I love the look and feel of the restaurant although it was a bit warm inside. I asked for a table outside and had my pick...probably a little chilly for some but just right for me. \n\nSweet tea and a corn bread CAKE were brought out right away. It was the size of a small pound cake and I knew I was in for trouble! I ordered the salmon cakes, greens and mac & cheese. Salmon cakes had lost their crispness on the outside, but the flavor was delicious. The greens were leafy and large and JUST RIGHT! And god bless the mac & cheese. Oozing with buttery cheesy goodness and a touch of the topping that had baked up brown and I may as well have died and gone to heaven.\n\nOf course I could not finish all the food. But my server offered a box without my asking. Great food and great service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good Pad Thai. Cold Singha beer. I order the same stuff every Thai restaurant. Coconut Ice Cream is good...ate at the bar....they let me have the remote to the TV too....perfect. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am not a \""cyclist,\"" I am just a bike rider.\n\nI became obsessed with Electra Townies after riding one.  I am a nerdy, middle-aged mom who just wanted a fun bike to ride with my kid.  I don't know from mountain bikes or road bikes.  After calling all over town and looking on the internet, a friend told me about Slippery Pig and how nice and helpful they were.  I called and they had my dream bike in stock, and at more than $100 less than I'd been able to find on the 'net.\n\nWhen I went in to see the bike, the little store was packed with hard-core cycling enthusiasts, talking about races and the virtues of various bike parts I had never heard of.  The lone guy running the store was courteous and took his time with each customer.\n\nDid I mention I know nothing about bikes?  Sometimes I hate going into specialty shops because the \""experts\"" there are just socially maladjusted snobs with their little corner of knowledge, and they lord that over you to assert their superiority.  I was a little nervous, because the Pig was definitely a \""real\"" bike shop.  But when it was my turn for assistance, my man Eli was nothing but nice.  Maybe the nicest guy ever.\n\nEven though it was past closing, he took his time going over the bike, gave me a beverage, offered me a discount, told me about the three free tune-ups I get for the next year, and gave me 20% off all accessories (because you know you have to trick out the new bike).\n\nWhen I went back a week later to get my basket attached, again at closing time, he remembered my name and seemed genuinely interested in what I thought of my bike.  George attached my basket, and I agree with the previous reviewer: he's great, too.\n\nI went in again last night to get a flat fixed, and this latest experience prompted me to write this review.  Again, I rolled in minutes to closing, and they fixed my flat right away, staying until well after closing.  But while I waited, Eli offered me my choice of delicious microbrews (!) and I sipped a lovely Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale while they fixed my flat and attached a new saddle!  Where does that happen anymore?\n\nFor context, I had taken my daughter's bike in to another LBS a year ago, and they took two days to fix the flat.  They were also nice guys, but two days to fix a flat?  (And no beer.  I think I am going to make free beer a prerequisite for service providers from now on.)\n\nThese guys are just the best, and reminded me why it is almost always worth it to seek out small, independent businesses.  Thanks, Slippery Pig! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\n\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\n\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \n\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\n\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Some of the best bar food in the state.  Burgers and Pizza are always a fantastic choice.  Entertainment is hit or miss, but at least they have some.  However, my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I seriously can not believe I've been wasting my time/money/hair anywhere else.  This place is amazing.\n\nI don't go to a stylist - I'm a man who relies on a strong jaw and deep, dreamy eyes for his presentation, not fancy hair perms. When I get up in the morning, I maybe have time to rub some wax through my hair before I'm driving cars and flexing muscles and being generally masculine and handsome, so I go to simple hair places where they can just cut my hair, and I can get on with my day.\n\nMy pet peeve is when I go to get my hair cut, and the hair cutter person asks me what I want, and then has a bunch of questions. I don't have time for that mess - just cut the hair! I don't care if you use clippers or scissors or a weed eater, just do the job and make me look good so I can get back to things. My experience at V's is just that - \""How do you want your hair?\"" Just make it look good.  Boom - job's done.  But wait...\n\nFinishing up the job with a straight razor shave on my neck, ears, and sideburns? Uhmm... yes please.  A quick trim of the eyebrows, a brief neck and shoulders massage, and a hot towel?  Awesome.  And I was in and out with no wait.\n\nI'm not going anywhere else from now on. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> majerle's is our downtown pre-event standby. tuesday night's atmosphere was notably fun - seriously. the staff was all decked out in halloween costumes and the mood was really energetic. it was a nice recovery from the tom's tavern disappointment 30 minutes earlier.\n\nwe shared a pile of wings. he drank beer and i was drinking my new standard, a vodka tonic with 1/2 club soda. an obnoxious drink? sure. but so what? our absolutely awesome server didn't show the slightest bit of annoyance toward me or my drink order.  she was genuinely sweet. i appreciate that. as far as the food and drink, our wings were hot, as requested, slightly breaded, tasty and served quickly. our server was on the ball, bringing a new beer almost immediately after he finished the previous one. awesome! this location is consistently good, quick and friendly. and that makes me happy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Anyone that gives Jarlings Custard Cup below a 5 star rating is functionally insane, or, they were huffing spray paint in the preceding 5 hours before enjoying their tasty treats.\n\nSeriously, Jarlings is that good. \n\nTo those drawing similarities between their product and ice cream? You're gastronomically challenged. Yes they are both cold and dairy based, but it ends there. Their custard is obviously so much denser and creamier than ice cream. Ice cream by process has to have a bunch of air stirred into it.  \n\nThe only knock on the Jarling organization is that they don't want to franchise it or distribute the secret process. \n\nJarlings inc world wide could have an IPO greater than Google's\n\n;) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  DOWNHILL.  I've been eating at Luke's a few times a month since 1996.  Over the last few years, It's slowly been going downhill.  Their signature Italian Beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold.  The extremely hard crusted french bread used to be dipped in au ju (gravy) to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor.  Now, no matter how you order it (extra gravy, wet, etc.) the sandwich comes out almost completely dry and is guaranteed to destroy the roof of your mouth.\n\nI'm really disappointed to see a restaurant I've had so many good lunches wither away, but even their health inspections have made dining here risky at best.  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=11712&business=LUKE'S%20RESTAURANT&address=1602%20%20%20E%20%20INDIAN%20SCHOOL%20RD&permitid=SG13198\n\nAll this and their prices have been skyrocketing!  Save your money and your health and go somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice, put the rest in the hall & called a different place. <|endoftext|>

Not sure why I had to come back for the second appointment, but I think it was a $$ thing...anyway, suppose to have surgery in two days and I canceled both!   The office insisted that I had to pay before the surgery (to the tune of $35)...but they hadn't billed for the kids last appointment.  If they had we would be at our deductible and owe NOTHING!  The lady argued with me about it...I was so upset, I have another appointment for the kids on Monday with another ENT to have their tubes out...what a circus! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The mission statement of Trader Joe's at one time (at least unofficially) was to bring good things to the lifestyles of schoolteachers. That is, to the lives of the educated, discerning yet underpaid. \n\nAt TJ's you can get things like good table wines, Italian-made pasta, gourmet sauces, and interesting cheese at prices that allow the masses to see how the other half lives. And that's why I've loved the place.\n\nIt pains me sometimes to think that it's kinda been painted with a wide \""health food grocery\"" brush. In another review I'll go into just WHY I don't want honorable, egalitarian spirit of TJ's corrupted by elitist sneer of effete health-nuts.\n\nSo yes, I am a fan. I've always gotten a fair deal at TJ's even back when I was struggling to make rent on my studio apartment. I felt they were in my corner, and I still do today. Even though I could easily be an elitist, effete health-nut. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Time to get some Hilton Honors points while on a quick trip to Phoenix.  There's a glut of hotels to choose from in the Camelback area.  They're all cheap in the summer so I chose the Homewood Suites because its always nice to have a big room.\n\nThe location is easy to get to and a block off of Camelback Rd.  Its close to shopping, plenty of restaurants and there's a good sports bar across the street.  Its not the newest Homewood Suites.  If I had to guess, its a late 90's or early 2000's build.  Its good in regards to the rooms being huge and all multi room setups with living rooms and bedrooms.  I don't think they have the \""Studio Suite\"" that the new Homewood Suites have.  The only bad side is the decor isn't newest even though its relevant and in good shape.  There's a full kitchen with a stove, dishwasher and fridge.  And they're still courteous enough to leave the bag of microwave popcorn.\n\nThe linens are fresh and white although they have a non white comforter which shocks me in the hotel world.  I think the comforter choice is a brand thing though.  There were two flat screen TV's in the upper 20in size.\n\nI asked for a high floor away from elevator and was given a 1st floor next to housekeeping on my particular visit.  That was disappointing especially since they acknowledged the disregard for my request when they checked me in.  Somehow they did not have my Hilton number which was odd.  They attributed the low floor to no having any top floor rooms available because of a new room they were installing.\n\nThe one sad feature of the hotel was the gym.  It had an elliptical and treadmill.  The treadmill was out of order.  There was a stack of weights too.  It wasn't the best gym I've seen and pretty emblematic of 90's hotels.  You'll find your average new Hampton Inn with a gym 3 or 4 times as large.\n\nIts a solid hotel, its affordable and as an extended stay format its a nice place to stay.  Are there newer options available but if you need a good affordable Hilton Honors qualifying hotel on the Camelback Rd corridor this is as good as the next. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Cheap, everyone seems to say that.  And it's true.  But I wasn't feeling it here.\n\nI for one did not want to dig through the dirty to find the golden product.  I know it's in the strip, but I didn't appreciate the amount of bugs flying around me as I was browsing the produce.  \n\nThis will probably be a place I just walk by the next time I'm in the strip.  I did not enjoy it here at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When I think of Desert Song, the word that comes to mind is \""haven.\""  Desert Song is a haven from the hustle and bustle of daily life.  A place to recharge and recenter. As soon as you walk in, you can breathe a little easier.  The atmosphere is calming and inviting.\n\nI've been to a lot of yoga studios and I think this place has the best staff.  I particularly love Mary Beth and Alisa.  Mary Beth is a great teacher, a great leader for the whole class but, on top of that, she gives tons of personal attention to everyone there.  Alisa is also wonderful. I know she usually teaches prenatal but I had her as a sub for another class and I thought she was top-notch.\n\nI've also gotten a couple massages here and they are wonderful.  Rivaling 5 star spa experiences I have had at some of the most luxurious resorts in the country.  \n\nDoes it sound like I'm crazy about this place? That's because I am! Seriously, give it a try. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :( <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was sure that under the new ownership, things would improve at Rainbow Cleaners. Not only was I wrong, but in fact things have become worse. Losing a customer's clothing seems to be their M.O. here. Just in the past 4 months, they have managed to lose 5 shirts with a total value of $200. In addition they lost a jacket I purchased in London last summer. What baffles me, is that the new owner and his staff have absolutely no procedure in place for how to deal with lost items. I have checked back 5 times in the past 4 months, with the hope that something would turn up. There is a smart ass counter person who works very hard to place the blame on the customer for the lost merchandise, and claims that she has absolutely no responsibility, stating over and over that \""it\"" (the computer) shows that the items were picked up. (Not by me!) The owner simply stands by, scratches his head and admits he has no clue how to deal with this problem, but admits that his high turnover in employees, may be partly to blame. There's a red flag here folks!!!  Stay away from this establishment! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I first heard of The Park House, due to their Blue Grass night (Wednesdays). My boyfriend is a big blue grass fan, so we rallied some friends and headed over.  Parking is street, but we didn't have any problems finding a spot.  \nI love the look of this place. It's so Pittsburgh. (In a fun architecture way, not a dive bar way)  There was a good crowd for the music, but we were still able to get a table with a big group.  \nAs other Yelpers have pointed out, there's free popcorn and peanuts you can help yourself to.  They have a small menu, but the food is good.  We split an order of the hummus. YUM!  A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy.  The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries.\nThey do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood.  \nWe had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set.  That scores major points in my book.  I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well.\n\nAll in all The Park House is a decent spot to hangout! I will definitely be back!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I judge a restaurant by its burger.   The burger is a perfect measuring stick for every-day dining establishments; It is sold almost everywhere and does not rely on special ingredients and is always a good barometer of a kitchen's capacity for meeting your temperature needs.  \n\nThat said, I have enjoyed the American Kobe burger here several times and it is consistently above-average and frequently quite excellent.   My wife has enjoyed the wrap and several other sandwiches and remains pleased.   We also enjoy the spinach and artichoke appetizer.   The wings are average at best but the kettle chips with chipotle ketchup rules.    Oh, and they have 1000 island.\n\nBut what matters is the beer and the porter and cream ale are both splendid if a bit  too sharp initially.  The server are pleasant and the place has a small, family atmosphere.   It's also reasonably priced. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When times are slow this place will make up for it by exagerating the problems with your vehicle.  Customer beware!  The service you get is not the one you really needed. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Third time is definitely a charm. \n\nFirst time: I had a gift certificate, tried the panini and an awesome selection of red wine I can't remember. After hearing so many great things about Postino, I was quite disappointed that night. My panini was just.   Yup. just. \n\nSecond time: I came here with a friend and it was his first time. Since it was our 3rd stop for happy hour that night, it was a bit hazy. \n\nThird time: I decided to try this place again with my brother and my sorority sister who needed a ride to the airport. We did the bruschetta, and bottle of wine for $20, and it more than made up for my first experience here. The Grayson was such a good cabernet selection. My brother even bought another bottle to take home for our dad's birthday. It's also $9 off any bottle you buy to take home. We ordered our board of 4 bruschetta, and although they made a mistake on two, they made it up to us by bringing out the original two we ordered, so we tried 6 different bruschettas. They were all different, ranging from sweet to savory, but none of them were bad. \n\nThe service here is really awesome, and it's consistently good. I can't wait to come back to try the other bruschetta flavors! <|endoftext|>

I normally just get pad thai from any thai place I visit but my friends got me to try the beef panang and it is really excellent.  I love this place.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Good chill spot after a game. Old school music videos in the background where it makes you reminisce of the good old days. Crowd vary in age and are there for a fun time. Drinks are cheap.\n\nHere's the downfall. Food didn't look appetizing. Generic food that looks as if it came from a frozen box and was heated in a microwave. Wouldn't be surprised. I would stay away from there drink specials. It may be cheap but thats because there's no alcohol! My friend ordered a blue hurricane for $4 but asked for a shot for it since there was no hint of alcohol whatsoever. With the shot it came out to $12. So much for drink specials. They ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better. Fail. Sad to say but they returned it. Stick with beer. You can't go wrong with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One word to describe this place? Cute. Another? Tasty.\n\nThe BFF and I visited Havana Cafe for the first time and hopefully not the last. We went for lunch on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. The place is pretty small (and cute!) but there are many tables inside and out. They had festive Cuban music playing which added to the atmosphere.\n\nSince neither of us know much about Cuban food we decided to go with the tapas sampler. Perfect for two people, it was loaded with 6 of their tapas. I'll murder the names, but there were plantains, chorizo, a tamale, black bean fritters, cod fritters and one other meat item I can't remember the name of. We also got a side of Sun Chips (sweet potato fries) and a half pitcher of red sangria because that's how we ladies roll for Saturday lunch.\n\nEverything in the sampler was delicious. My favorites were the plantains, the black bean fritters and the tamale but I really did like it all. The sweet potato fries were good but I've had better. That's the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. Nothing in the sampler was spicy so it's a good option for just about anyone, except vegetarians.\n\nThe sangria was good, more wine tasting than some sangrias. i'd like to try the white sangria next time.\n\nThe service was great. Everyone was friendly and they didn't try to speed us along or anything as we took our time chatting and munching.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu so I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few more things next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have difficulty sleeping in hotels if there is noise coming from vending machines, ice machines, noisy neighbors, parties... So, I add a request for a quiet room to my reservation in the comments section.  I guess I forgot to mention street noise on this reservation.  Rooms facing 44th Street get considerable street noise all night.  And, o.k., I get it... we're trying to go green (everyone applaud).  This hotel does not allow you to control heat vs. air conditioning.  Yes, you can set the thermostat, WHEN THE SYSTEM IS TURNED ON, BUT...  When the outside temps are above 70, they turn on A/C.  When they are below 55, they turn on the heat.  When they are in between, everything is shut off.  Can't even get a fan to recirculate the air in the room.  It would be nice to be able to decide for myself whether I need heat or air conditioning, or turn on the fan to circulate air and get some white noise to cover the street noise.  I won't be back.  There are plenty of other choices in the area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Almost but not quite perfect. Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \""Codfather\"" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \""Codfather\"" is prepared 3 ways - \""Part 1\"" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \""Part 2\"" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \""Part 3\"" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \""express lunch\"" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings. <|endoftext|>

They at least choose to accomodate customers.\n\nDon't know how this store stays in business. <|endoftext|>

If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the kind of place you find in a mall.  Fast food salad, pasta and pizza.  I had a salad/pizza combo.  The pizza was cold and the crust had a weird metallic taste.  The salad was your standard plate of bland greens.  With all the offices and the hospital nearby, you would think there would be better options for lunch in this shopping plaza. Nope.  That's why I always end up at the Good Egg.  It's hard to screw up an omlette. Despite the high convenience factor, I will not be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Best way to put our experience there into words? Bipolar. We went for a prom dress. Poor customer service (other than the consultants who were great, that's why I rate 2 stars, one each for each consultant we worked with, the store itself and other staff get a zero), turning away people 40 min prior to close, guess they don't want to work one minute past 7pm = lost sales/revenue, restocking holds even after calling to say we were coming to get it prior to closing, 5 minute alterations taking over an hour (a brides bustle apparently trumped us, we learned this later, we were willing to pick up the dress another day but were asked to wait). Here's our experience if you care for details...visit one, Saturday morning...we walked in and saw prom/bridesmaid etc. to our left and migrated towards the dresses. Okay, yes, the was a little podium to our right with a woman standing there, but didn't think anything of it (assumption was made, that she is there for women with bridal fitting appointments). She didn't say a word to us. We perused the dresses, pulled some, even asked someone at the sales counter if a certain dress was available in another size somewhere (was told what was out was what they had and that was fine). Still, no one mentioned to us that in order to try on the dresses, we needed a junior consultant working with us (everyone is apparently supposed to check in with the lady at the podium). They had 2 opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us. Anyway, we go \""sign in\"", the lady at the podium barks over the intercom for a consultant and my daughter is taken to a fitting room. I will say this, the stylist/consultant was very nice and very kind. We put 2 dresses on hold, since this was the first store we visited and headed to some other stores to shop. When it became clear, around 5pm that the dress she wanted was one of the ones at David's, I called to let them know we were coming for it and not to restock it. They said great and we headed back in that direction. When we got there at 5:30, the dress had been restocked. They couldn't find it in the \""on holds area\"" WTH? I didn't complain, just glad it was still THERE, albeit on the regular sales rack. My daughter tried it on again and we noted the hook and eye closure was broken and there was a seem pull on the back as well. Again I will say, the consultant this round was very nice and kind as well, just as much as the first, even helping my daughter find matching shoes etc. and getting the minor alterations done on the spot. Or so we thought. Here's where I need to complain. The alteration lady took the dress to the back, and after about 20 min, we inquired what was taking so long. Our consultant was kind enough to go check for us and came back and said she was currently working on it, We had dinner plans, it was after 6 at this point so we said we could come back for it. The consultant seemed miffed at that and asked us the wait, since the alterations were being done, right then, and the alteration lady was taking the time to do it immediately and putting other things aside for us. We felt bad, and stuck around. BAD idea. At 6:20, still waiting, a prom girl comes in and tries to check in with the podium and is TURNED AWAY, the woman there tells her that since they close at 7pm, she won't have time to try on dresses. WTH again?! There is 40 minutes left to pick and try on dresses! Our visit that morning was only 40 minutes? Lost sale opportunity. We witnessed this again 10 min later, this time with a bride and her bridesmaid seeking bridesmaids dresses. At 6:45, we were done...late for dinner, it had been an hour, when finally, the alterations woman comes out. She was apologetic at least, telling us a bride's bustle had to jump in front of us. Another WTH moment! We were fine picking it up another day but were told she was working on it and asked to wait. A very frustrating moment indeed. Someone should have come and told us that, we would have left and come back. Overall, their consultants, who I'm sure work on commission, were motivated, friendly and helpful. The other staff were horrible! What's also bad for this location is I am a bride and haven't begun my dress search but perused a little while I was there, even mentioned I was a bride, totally went on deaf ears. Another lost sale opportunity. We will never shop here again. <|endoftext|>

I understand when you are tired at work, or even having a bad day, but your customers are NEVER suppose to feel unwanted. Soon my best friend and I walked in the door the atmosphere was not very good. It seemed to be tension. The lady who did my Pedi was TERRIBLE! She will NEVER get a tip from me nor EVER do my feet again. I wanted to take my feet out the water and leave, but I really needed my Pedi. She completely ignored how I asked for my feet to be done. My polish looks like I done it myself instead of going to get it professionally done! It was such a rush job! I'm not even going to get started on my Mani!!! GRRR! I'm so livid, even writing this review. I will never go back! They don't even deserve the 1 star that I just gave them. Just HORRIBLE! SMH!!!!! <|endoftext|>

(The spin studio is dark, really dark.  Arrive with plenty of time to find a bike and to adjust it for your frame & body.)  I was greeted at 8:45am by the instructor and spinning phenom, Samantha.  She played great music and inspired everyone to push harder.She would turn up the music occasionally when the black light was on, it became also trance or rave- like.\n\nAfter visiting a few more spin classes at the Village on Camelback, I learned that Studio 360 is a stand-up studio (they rarely sit down when riding.)  After more spin practice, I will return and see if I can ride standing up the whole time.\n\nSorry that I missed out on the Yoga Studio 360, that segment of the business ended a few months ago. <|endoftext|>

Every food establishment in Phoenix should be required to offer the same brand of iced tea, in several flavors, with your choice of lemon or orange slices.  The only problem?  Frequently long lines.  But super great and friendly service.  Don't forget to pick up a brownie or tiramisu.  Oh yeah, they have really great groceries, too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This guy totally bait and switched me. I went in and he told me 50 dollars and I thought that was high so I went and called my insurance to see if it would be cheaper to just get new frames. I went back in and said ok I will do it. Then I pulled out a 10% discount card and then he told me 69 but he will do it for 50. I thought that was pretty unethical.  I told him I would pay 45 which would be his orginal quote plus my 10% off. He refused. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had checked out the reviews on Great Wall south, and decided to try it. Walking in at 3:45 PM, there were maybe 3 tables occupied. The decor was inviting. I loved the huge fish tank they had on display. From there, sadly, it began to go downhill. \n\nA lady at the bar waved me to the dining room, and a waiter sauntered over to ask what I wanted to drink. Also he asked me if I wanted a menu......strange. After getting settled with the menu, I ordered 2 egg rolls, hoping that since it was between mealtimes I would get freshly fried ones. Nope, not to be. Cold, hard and greasy. So back they went, with a request for fresh ones, told the waiter I didn't mind waiting for them.\n\nI ordered Sa Cha Scallops as an entree, with a small pork fried rice. The new egg rolls came out at the same time as the entree. I could deal with that, no probs. BUT....egg rolls were NOT fresh, they were warmer, and just as hard. Scallops were good and plentiful, presentation was good, fried rice was good also. The egg rolls were the turnoff. \n\nI'm giving it 2 Yelp stars, but if you love good egg rolls, don't come here expecting to find them. Panda's Den in north Charlotte puts this place to shame. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just logged on to amtrak.com to buy a one way ticket to Chicago for a Monday train a couple weeks from now.  Price for a ONE WAY ticket has gone up yet again to $37.00!!!!!  \n\nThanks to a slow day at work, I decided to do the math on this to see exactly how much of a ripoff Amtrak really is.  At $1.70 a gallon for gas, even if you were to drive a Hummer H2 to Chicago, it would only cost $21.00 in gas to get there.  If you've got a Prius, driving would run you less than $5.00.  A 38 foot Winnebago would cost about $32.00.  In fact, you would need a vehicle that gets only 6.2 MPG for Amtrak to be the less expensive option.  Did I mention I'm having a slow day at work?\n\nMoral of the story:  Don't waste your time looking at Amtrak as an alternative to driving.  Even if you have a vehicle large enough comfortably sleep 6, it's still cheaper to drive.  I also don't imagine Amtrak's reliability issues have been resolved by the price increases, so the extra cost really doesn't get you anything other than a strong likelihood of a 90+ minute delay in reaching your destination. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stayed here for four miserable nights & two awful rooms.  The only reason I gave them even two stars was because the staff were very nice.\n\nThe first room had a broken A/C so we tossed & turned all night.  Half of the lights in the room didn't work and neither TV came in.  And if that wasn't bad enough the bedroom was located adjacent to the back of a restaurant next door so we were woken each morning at 4:00 to non-stop truck deliveries backing up, beep, beep, beep!!!\n\nOn our third day the water was turned off for the whole hotel for several hours of emergency Rotor-Rooter service.\n\nThe second room was better than the first, but the A/C still didn't work well and the tub had a major drip...we just closed the bathroom door and dealt with it.\n\nI'm afraid to say that this might have been the last time I stay at an Embassy Suites Hotel because as I recall, the one in Austin, TX wasn't great either. <|endoftext|>

They carry plenty of bagged meals for two people that you can just heat up and eat. They aren't full of awful chemicals like at the grocery store, either. The people who work here are very friendly, and I don't get stressed out shopping here like I do at Safeway or Fry's, plus most things are cheaper. They seem to constantly run out of the Thai Chicken Noodle Salad though... not sure why they don't order more. Every time they get it in, people buy 5 or 6 boxes of it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used Scotts Flooring a year ago to put in new hardwood floors throughout my house. From the start things ran smoothly. They gave me a fair quote and showed up on time to all appointments. The floors went in smoothly and looked great. Why the two stars? Well the job was never really finished. We had Scotts take out about two inches thick of satillo tile and repaced with hardwood flooring. We have a fireplace with same flooring. They took it out for us as well and replaced it with a different tile that matched the floors. The replacement tile had very sharp edges and i have a baby so I asked them to round the edges or something. They said they had done all that was paid for and washed their hands of the issue. Which was true, the fireplace was not included in the original quote and i told them I would pay to have it completed well, but I think they had other projects to move onto and were done with me. After several no return calls i gave up and sought my own solutions. On top of that the installer left several gaps in the flooring between the cabinets and the wood. They came in to fix it, but their fixing the gap looked messy and they still missed lots of spots that were never completed. I eventually gave up trying to get their help. They had their money and were done with my needs. My floors looked great and if you're not taking out two inches worth of satillo tile you probably won't have the gap issues we had and they'll probably do a good job. If you're replacing satillo, really do your research and do not pay in full until you've gone over every single crack in the floor. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I heard good things about this place and thought I'd bring my daughters there for dinner.  I ordered shrimp parmesan for 20 dollars and got four overcooked shrimp covered in sauce with watery white rice on the side.  My daughter ordered Linguini with clams and it was too gritty for her to eat.  I literally heard her bite into a sandy clam.  My other daughter ordered fettucini alfredo which was decent.  The best part of the meal was the bread served beforehand.  Even the caesar salad was disappointing.  I have to say that for a $75 tab, there are plenty of other places I would rather go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My girlfriends and I were in Phoenix for a weekend away from SF and unfortunately, there weren't very many options for classier places in the area we stayed in. \n\nSky Lounge was across the street from Hotel Palomar, so after dinner and a few drinks, we decided to check it out. Even with our buzz, this place was a bust! \n\nWe had to pay $10 cover (which isn't really a big deal) to get in to a place w/c wasn't even nice (interior-wise) and had a practically empty downstairs area. However, that might be better than going upstairs with all the creepers looking to prey on drunk girls. \n\nWasn't our scene, so we left after 15 minutes and $50 poorer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow. Simple, almost fast food soul. Good food, fried fish, fried chicken. Did not have the collards or okra. I am just not that soulful. Fast friendly service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Delicious Southern food!\n\nThe cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs, with Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, and Yams. The ribs were full of yummy NC vinegary flavor, the mac was cheesy and good, the collard greens were tangy and flavorful, and the yams were savory and sweet. For my first dinner in Charlotte, I was def satisfied.\n\nPrices are decent, and the service is good.\n\nParking can be a little tough. My best suggestion would be to park in one of the nearby structures, bc there really isn't street parking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My son and I have been seeing Dr. Simpson since about 2003...and I must say that this is the BEST relationship I have been in with a healthcare provider in years.  What a terrific OFFICE!  The people there are always kind, especially Pamela who mans that front desk with such incredible skill.  She is savvy with insurance, warm with patients, funny and so very kind!  \n\nI can cite lists and lists of reasons why you should visit this Dentist...\n--My son fell off the jungle gym (or something like that) at school and dislodged a tooth - and Dr. Simpson checked his tooth immediately upon arrival, explaining what had happened and giving us our options.  It was a baby tooth, but my son was pretty shaken up and we wanted to make sure it could stay in his mouth for the balance of it's short life (it did!)\n--My husband (then fiance) hadn't had his teeth cleaned in a while and wanted to have then cleaned and x-ray'd....only to find out he had periodontal disease!  Dr. Simpson was on it immediately and I am told he enjoyed a thorough cleaning with some relaxing gas and tunes from his iPod - reportedly the most comfortable cleaning of his life (seriously?  I think they scraped his teeth down to the roots!)\n--And ME!  I have pretty good teeth but Dr. Simpson reminds me of how to keep them that way, and he's saved me from a couple exposed roots and some tricky plaque deposits!  Whew!\n\nWhat makes this more impressive is that we tried to LEAVE Dr. Simpson when insurance issues made it tough for us to stay...and we tried another dentist and everyone BEGGED me to let them go back to Dr. Simpson.  So..humbly and politely I rescheduled with Pamela who welcomed us with open arms...\n\nDon't bother looking...there isn't another Dentist like this! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So glad my co-worker and I went and checked this place out before we did Friday happy hour with our 15 co-workers!\n\nBartender did not greet us even though all of the men at the bar turned to look...sure she saw us.  we sat down read the menu 3x.  Long day at work and the last thing I wanted to do was hunt down a beer.\n\nWe waited around for 15 min at a table and left.  We then walked 20 yards to Uncle Sam's and had beer in hand in within 5 min.\n\nI am so disappointed!  I was excited to bring my co-workers to a new place \""for us\"" that has fish tacos.\n\nUnfortunately we did not even have the chance to try anything other than the service.  Not a chance in hell I would take/ask my coworkers to this place.  I would have been mortified if 15 of my friends came\n in and were ignored on my recommendation.\n\nSucks cause it looked so\nFun until u couldn't get a beer! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stay far away from this company. You will waste countless hours on endless paperwork, forms, tests and still never get a straight answer about being able to go out and cover shifts. Been on the registry 5 weeks and not one shift. They use several different phone numbers from the west coast and southwest region and seem to pride themselves on it. The number you dial might be long distance, but the person you are talking to is probably sitting right inside the Phoenix Office. Also, their office is no longer on 44th st. It is on 30th st and Camelback. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to copy Stephanie B's review below.  It's worth reading again.   It needs to be posted again for the sake of those unknowing customers who think they're getting something good out of this.\nI don't know Stephanie B but what she said is dead on.  I couldn't agree more.  I think this place is overrated....and the bread is very hard to sink your teeth into.\n\nI ordered 3 sandwiches - the regular tomato/mozzarella/basil, the proscuitto/cheese and the tuna.  Out of all 3, all priced at $8 each, the tomato/mozzarella/basil was the best.  But for you, reader, don't even waste your $8.  Just go to another place for good eats.  \nThank goodness I brought my own water in a stainless steel waterbottle.\n\nStephanie B's review:\n\n\""The look and taste of organic food without any of the philosophy behind it....and the bread is very difficult to sink your teeth into.\n\nI know...I know...I just berated your favorite sandwich shop. But really, this is your favorite place because either (1) your options are so limited in the area or (2) you require a feeling of prestige to eat.\n\nIt's good to be organic. The ingredients taste delicious. I don't even mind paying $10 for a vegetarian sandwich that tastes good (albeit difficult to eat) and a water for lunch. But what bothers me is the mixed message that's more like false advertizing. \n\nFirst there is no place to sit inside at all. So chances are, you're getting this meal to-go (with all the packaging that entails). There's outdoor seating that is shared with Cafe Lux (fair trade cafe that's awesome but similarly expensive). Seating is not available at typical eating times and lines may be long.\n\nSecond, you cannot order a beverage from the US, Mexico or anywhere that it might arrive in even a remotely sustainable way. All their drinks are from Italy. There's no option for fountain drinks or even local bottled water. If you ask for a drink that hasn't traveled 5,000 miles to be here, they point you to a water cooler  in the cafe next door.\n\nThird, the service sucks. There are plenty of people working there, almost tripping over each other politely trying to not infringe of anyone's  space  by trying to use the cash register.\n\nFourth,  The decoration is designed to make you feel like it's sustainable from recycled organic materials. They even offer an organic tote bag for sale ($10).  This is their attempt to offer a solution for all the waste created by the perpetual to-go-ness. It's almost like they're laughing at you calling you an \""idiot\"".  We can call this 'the bleeding heart tax'. If you forgot your recycled to-go bag at home, they can give you another one for the price of two meals.\n\nFifth and finally, the bread is hard to eat. So you can't take a bite of your sandwich without it falling apart a bit. There are no silverware to save you from the embarrassment of using your hands. The wrapping is brown paper with very thick wax paper lining, so you can't use it to wrap around your sandwich to keep it together while you're trying to tear pieces of the bread off with your teeth.\n\nBut they give you a sweet with every order....and if you decide to come back with your empty glass bottle from Italy, they will recycle it for you.  --And if you start coming here regularly you will look very hip when the people who work there remember your name, order and the fact that you do not require a boutique to-go bag.\n\nI'd eat from there again, if you pick up the order and return the empty Italian bottles for me.\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dude. We're over here. No? No eye contact?  Too busy with your iPhone?  \n\nThe bartender was beat. We left without being acknowledged or served (and we literally waived our arms).  Could be good, but who'd know.   Wasn't busy either.  You're fired. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  DO NOT take your car here unless you want something messed up!!! Took my car in for an oil change and was told my brake fluids would need changing for an extra 75 bucks.  Saw the oil light on my car go off in a few weeks but took off getting it looked at for another few weeks.  Found a nice surpise later that the cap wasnt screwed on right from the last oil change and car had engine damage.  These guys are the WORST shop in Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Absolutely the worst bar I've been to . After about 5 drinks I realized they purposely made their drinks extremely weak. I spent so much money and barely got tipsy. I told the bartender I was disappointed with my drinks and she literally screamed at me as I walked out of the door ( I still left her a good tip!) I will never ever go there again. Trashy, nasty and extremely rude staff. There was even a fight with some dude broke glass and almost hit us with it and there was no real bouncers- just a few people who worked there who barely stopped him from attacking us. Completely ruined my night-especially the rude bartenders. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I called four times last night to place a to-go order (7:30p-8p) and got their recording each time.  Either this place is SO busy they can't get to the phone or they had closed up early and went home.  \n\nI'm still craving Thai...and looking for a great place in Central Phoenix.  Any other suggestions or should I give this place another chance? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My Mother had the unfortunate experience of being there for 6 weeks in rehab. Although the place looks nice, after searching many places this one seemed to be the best, although we were not overly impressed. She needed to get out of the hospital within 2 days.  I have hesitated saying anything ,because  there are some nice employees there. My Mother's experience was one of total neglect. Aside from being served molded bread on several occasions, they would also bring her meal tray, drop it and go, even though she could not even reach the tray. I think the most overwhelming problem is apathy on the part of employees. If it was not for my sister who was there daily, nothing would have been done. As she could not walk during this time, she was wearing protective diapers with a pad on the bed. On several occasions my sister went in and my Mother had been sitting in her urine for several hours. She even got a sore on her back from it. When my sister removed the pad it was so saturated from sitting for several hours that it fell apart. My Mother needed water. She would call someone. They would always tell her they would be right there. Once a nurse came in and said she would be right back. An hour later she called again and asked what happened. They told her that nurse went to lunch. Now, if this was one or two incidences I might not complain, but this was daily. One nurse came in and told my Mom, \""You stink.\"" Those were her exact words. I would like to know what she would think if someone said that to her Mother! Although my Mother needed rehab to walk, she is of sound mind and very with it. My Mother would tell me she would be calling and the nurses would be in the hall laughing and carrying on, not responsive in the least. Total neglect of a patience's needs. When the director was informed, I think he tried to brush it off. We made several complaints during her stay there. We were not asking for any special treatment. We just wanted my Mother to be taken care of with dignity and respect. If you don't have the humanity to work with older people you need to move on to another line of work. They get away with it because they can, that's why they do it. \nPlease don't send your loved ones to this place. They seem nice to your face, but as soon as you leave they have carte blanche to do whatever they want, with obviously no accountability to anyone apparently. It breaks my heart that my Mom was treated this way. No one deserves this! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The words \""epic fail\"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\n\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\n\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\n\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\n\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\n\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not China Town, but more like China Oasis\n\nThis is the closest thing to a China Town in Phoenix.  There is not comparison to the ones in LA or NY, but there is a lot of character present.  I usually come here for Dim Sum at Golden Buddha and go to the L Ranch Supermarket, but it is small and quaint, but does give a fun representation of the Zen Chinese in the Koi Fish Pond and garden.  Don't expect LA or NY China Town, but not bad for the desert. \n\nIf you find this useful, funny or cool, please check below. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Beware of the fried rice!  \nThis place is in my neighborhood and one weeknight in March we went for the first time when family was visiting. We ordered fried dumplings to start, saut\u00e9ed green beans, double saut\u00e9ed sliced pork, beef with broccoli and chicken with mixed vegetables with an order of steamed rice for the table. I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! I didn't care for the pork, thought it was too \""porky\"" but everyone else liked it so I'm the outlier.  The woman manager/owner comes up to us at the end, asks us how we liked our meal. I tell her we really enjoyed it, we live in the neighborhood and we'd definitely be coming back. Then this is where it went south. She asked us if we'd like boxes for our leftovers and we were debating whether to take the steamed rice. She says she can give us a carton of steamed rice packaged already and my husband says that if we take rice, we'd just take our leftover from the table rather than the carton she was offering.  \""We wouldn't want it to go to waste and take new rice.\""  Her reply??? \""Oh that doesn't go to waste, we use for something else.\"" Oh really?? My husband asks what it is used for and I'm not joking...she replied  \""We use that for fried rice\"". We were speechless. And just so there is no confusion about what rice she was talking about, that we are absolutely clear we were talking about the half eaten rice ON our table she says, pointing to the bowl on our table, \""see, it's like nobody really touches it anyway.\""  I'm not joking. We left absolutely devastated! And though I really liked the food, I will not eat here again and cannot recommend it to anyone else. There are basic minimums I expect from a restaurant I patronize and reusing leftovers from the table is outrageous and unacceptable.  So sad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great restaurant! Being that I was hanging out in Everitt for most of my stay in Chambana - I got very familiar with Zorba's!\n\nWhat to say about it... Service is always great. The people that work there always seem happy and treat you well. Prices are totally reasonable. I went almost every Tuesday as it was cheaper on Tuesday. Their gyros are great - though if you get a normal gyro you will be left smelling, well, like a gyro. The chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason. So good.\n\nI went almost every Tuesday and I'd get a large normal gyro with a side of fries. I'd bring a textbook and study for an hour or two while enjoying my amazing food. Great place to study ( at least for me) as there was always enough noise to keep my mind from wandering - but little enough noise so that I could concentrate.\n\nNever eat here before a test. You'll go into a food coma and not do well on your test. I learned this the hard way. The very, very hard way. <|endoftext|>

I guess they don't get very many ladies dining alone :)\n\nFood\nWarm Croissants - YUMMY! So very good.\n\nFirst Course -\nRatatouille Tart with Parmesan Crisps & Black Olive Tapenade - Light and fluffy with lots of veggies. Came with a small salad that was pretty tasty as well. Olive Tapenade is always a little salty regardless of who makes it however this one was not as salty as most. Very good.\n\nSecond Course-\nDuck Confit with Citrus Sauce - YUM! Cooked to perfection and the sauce was just right. Also came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes, a couple of veggies. Only ate half as I wanted to make sure I saved room for dessert. So needless to say I have enough for dinner tomorrow night. They even packed in a few extra of those mouth water croissants. Double kudos for that.\n\nThird course -\nWarm Chocolate Tarts with Fresh Whipped Cream - SINFUL! Seriously mine came out nice and warm, fresh from the oven with a nice dollop freshly made whipped cream. So very good indeed.\n\nI must say that dining alone has its perks. I got to people watch, even watched a proposal (she did say yes by the way) and the staff were really nice and very attentive. I will definitely have to visit them again soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes.  A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef (shui zhu nio) and Yu xiang Eggplant.  Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I've had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I've had at China Palace, I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.\n\nContrary to popular belief, China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner.\n\nChina Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.\n\nPrices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.\n\nHighly Recommended. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place from the outside looks pretty old, but on the inside it's pretty nice as far as bowling alleys go.  \n\nA few times we had to wait in line for the late night bowling thingy to start, you know where they play music and videos and turn the lights down. Rock and roll bowling or Disco bowling, I don't know, I forgot what they call it.\n\nFood, no thank you, seems pretty typical pre-made deep fried stuff.\n\nBeer and bowling are always good.   They put a ice container in the pitcher to keep your beer cold, but it displaces about one 12oz beer so you kinda get ripped off ----but at least the beer is cold!\n\nI'd like to be more like The Dude from the Big Lebowski every time I go bowling, \""that rug really tied the room together, did it not?\"". <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had to make sure I didn't leave any sauce on my fingers prior to typing this. Wait, did I? Nope, clean. Most likely because I licked them clean from the baller sauce that is on this BBQ. The sauce has a great consistency to it and it clings nicely to the meat. \n\nI went with the sig-other and between the two of us, we had the pork shoulder sandwich,  brisket, and ribs. I think we both went with fries and the Cole-slaw for our sides. They were fine. Sides are sides. I realllllllly wish there would have been corn bread. Something doesn't right within me if there is no corn bread to accompany BBQ. I was sad when I found out there was no cornbread.\n\nBut then I was happy again the moment I was able to put that delicious pig in my mouth. The ribs were ribs. The brisket and the pork shoulder was where it was at for me, but really, I think you can slap that sauce on cardboard and it would be delicious.\n\nI'm a west-sider so coming out here is a haul. A worth while haul. Be prepared to wait though; the dining room is small.  They did get out food out to us really quickly, but if we would have come 15 minutes later we would have had to wait in a long line to place our order, and then would have had no where to sit. \n\nOh, and if I wasn't such a bottomless pit, there would have been plenty of leftovers as the portions are plentiful. I definitely did not leave hungry. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So far the best Chinese delivery we've had here in Madison. Their food is flavorful, fresh, and not super-greasy. \n\nThey also have an online menu to order from, which is amazing! It makes life simple, and I don't have to worry that I mispronounce something or said the wrong thing entirely. \n\nThe only complaint I had is that while our food was steamy hot, the crab rangoons weren't. They were actually a little on the cool side. But, it's delivery, so that's not all that surprising. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped by here for a quick lunch. Looks like a great diversified menu with plenty to eat! It'll take several visits to try everything you want, but I'll base this review on just one.\n\nWe had the saganaki (Flaming feta) for an appetizer. While the taste of the dish was solely melted feta with a little oil, watching the guy light it on fire right besides your table was just awesome. \n\nI personally got the Chicago gyro with fries. The gyro meat was nice and crispy, while the flavors balanced quite nicely. The sauce falling off the pita actually made it more enjoyable, I'd say. The fries were also pretty crispy.\n\nGood value lunch, and I would recommend if you're looking for a fix in the area. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Absolutely horrible. I ordered a white wine spritzer, the server told me I don't think we carry that, I don't know these fancy drink names. I told her what it was and that it's been around forever. My wife ordered a frozen strawberry lemonade and got a regular. When ordering our food she laughed when I specified no poblano peppers or any spice. I ordered a weight watchers meal as I wasn't too terribly starving. When our food came she just assumed that my wife who is larger than I wanted the weight watchers. I was completely appalled. I spoke to the manager at once told her everything and explained we were leaving and I was paying for nothing. Next time I visit Phoenix this will not be where I go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love the food at Outback but not a big fan of some of the appetizers. We usually hit this Outback about once a month for a good lunch because the service is great, the food has yet to disappoint and we never have to wait for anything. Outside of dinner after 7 pm here you can get in and out fairly quickly and feel that you got what if not more than you paid for. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nice people. Cute little place. But the food isn't that great. The meat was undercooked both times I tried beef and chicken. The only two good things are the veggie rolls and the vegetable soup. The vegetable soup is really tasty and has a lot of flavor in it. I don't recommend it unless it was for either of those. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped by for a late meal on a Thursday night and the place was quite lively, but there were still a few tables open.  The servers all seemed to be having a good time and took excellent care of us, checking in just enough but not too much.  \n\nThe menu is small, but has something for everyone.  We tried the carnitas - flavorful and tender - and a burger - expertly seasoned and juicy.  Both were slightly overcooked: the burger arrived more medium rare than the requested rare, and on the carnitas the yolk of one fried egg was deliciously soft, while the other was just a bit too set.  However the high quality ingredients and delightful flavors evened out any imperfections.  The drink menu was well rounded and we enjoyed both the beer and cocktails.  \n\nThe small touches in design elevate the interior from the ordinary in an entirely pleasing way.  Tip Top is a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to enjoying it again soon. <|endoftext|>

I will be so happy when Downtown Phoenix starts thriving to the point that restaurants decide to open their doors on Sundays (most don't). However, until that hopeful day comes, I will rely on Marjele's to feed me since they are one of the few restaurants who stay open on Sundays. Mareje's provides solid food. Food that you will know what you're getting yourself into before you get there. They also have several TVs and always provide quick and friendly service. <|endoftext|>

I worked as a ticket taker at the old Three Rivers Stadium and I have such fond memories of working there.  I was 17 when you won your last divisional title and I don't think you've had a winning season in my entire adult life.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my Bucs!  I do love you so much.  In a way, I have to.  See, you're like the boy I knew in grammar school who was such a sweet kid, but he was constantly failing his classes--and he lived in a nice house!  \n\nLet's take a look at your records since 2000.  I warn you dear Pirates--it won't be pretty.  But it's something you have to come to terms with:\n\n2001:  62-100 (last pl)\n2002:  72-89 (4th Pl)\n2003:  75-87 (4th pl)\n2004:  72-89 (5th pl)\n2005:  67-95 (last)\n2006:  67-95 (5th pl)\n2007:  68-94 (last)\n2008:  67-95 (last)\n2009:  62-99 (last)\n2010:  56-101 (last)*     *As of 09-29-2010\n\nSo that's six seasons in last place, two 100 loss seasons, and this season has been the worst so far.\n\nYes, I'll still go to your games next season.  I'll still go with my husband, my co-workers, and my Girl Posse.  My dad and I will still have our father-daughter nights out here.  But like the parents of that sweet little boy in grammar school with the failing grades, you're really trying my patience.  And don't forget, the Washington Wild Things have been wooing me for the longest! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You'll find a diverse array of people dining here. This Merry Ann's isn't nearly as pretty as its newer sister location, but the food is the same. Sometimes you'll see students studying here.\n\nIt's a 24 hour place, and there's one of those \""use the claw to grab a stuffed animal\"" machines in the back if you're interested. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> While I can't say I've ever actually purchased anything for myself, I keep coming back to My Sister's Closet. It's probably more the thrill of the hunt for that perfect (shirt/pants/jacket/etc) that keeps me interested. Maybe its just me, but they usually don't have much in my size. They do have plenty of Med - Large sizes and 35 - 40 waist pants.\n\nFYI MSC - I wear a 38s jacket, size S collared shirts, a 30ish waist with 29inch inseam, and size 7 1/2 - 8 shoe; just in case you were wondering. ;)\n\nMy wife seems to have some luck though. She's found a few designer shirts, a couple pairs of 7 jeans, and even some cool Coach purses. I think this is definitely a better place for the female shopper. \n\nBest of luck to all you shoppers; and who knows, maybe you'll bump into me in there not buying something. :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After spending a month in Europe, I was very excited to come back to Madison and rediscover Clasen's European Bakery. Though the shop is about ten times bigger than any bakery in Europe, you can find some pretty authenic goods, and the kitchen is said to be staffed by German master bakers. Of course, nothing tasted quite the same as the real European thing, and you are sure to find some pretty standard American bakery there as well.\n\nClasen's doesn't look like too much when you first walk in, but who cares when you have a warehouse of good to gawk at? There are shelves and shelves full of cookies, desserts, breads, sweetbreads, etc! Everything I've tried is quality and very fresh. Be sure to come early for the best selection.\n\nPrices are decent, but the staff can be grumpy. There is ususally a sale or special deal to look for on one of the store's front tables, and a wide selection of holiday items. Also don't miss the sampling area near the back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have gone to Capital Grille over the years in other locations and have always had a nice experience but the Biltmore location gets a \""D\"" in my book!!!!\nThe bar area and bartender were friendly and attentive :) so that part was great! The dining experience was TERRIBLE!!!!  The waiter was not only very rude, he constantly forgot simple things and was totally unattentive... so after 5 things and 2 hrs into dinner we requested the manager who was just the same and sarcastic on top of everything else! For a $300.00 meal that was average at best. Thank goodness the company I was with was wonderful!!!! Too many other choices to be treated the way we were :( I was so disappointed that I wrote corporate headquarters! To be continued when I hear back from them!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 3/5/11: we met some other families here for our first visit. Separate play area for under 2 years made it a lot easier for me to relax & enjoy watching my son play on his own & with other little ones. We will be back. :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I work right down the street from La Tolteca so many of my co-workers visit here regularly. I finally visited...\n\nFOOD\nThe menu has a great variety and is pretty inexpensive. However, my burrito kinda started to taste funny as I finished it up- almost like cleaning solution--- I didn't get sick so I'm not sure what that taste was. \nI like the bakery and the sweets selection and the salsa is pretty good. \n\nOTHER\nWe also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees. The catered food was a lot better than my burrito. \n \nI will give La Tolteca another chance... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Floyds on Nation Ford rd is terrible!!!! Worst collards and macoroni and whatever in the world. And space. Taste like noodles, salt, and water. No milk or cheese. Not made with love. Food made with HATE. Im so sorry the owner died. Should have taken this so called restaurant with him. I should have known the food was gonna be bad because of the bad service!!! Floyds food does not taste nearly as good as mine. Reply to my post and i will sell a real recipe for collards and real macaroni and cheese. Oh, the location milton road food excellent!! Holla at me or them to learn how to cook!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.\n\nI don't get this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great location for someone new to the city. Your right in the middle of it all! Within walking distance of Charlotte's great bars & restaurants. The staff was very accommodating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food is great but the service at the bar is horrendous. \n\nLast few times we have went the bartender was unable to cope with even a half full bar. Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. \n\nSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \""give me a second I have to get this for these people first\""  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. \n\nOn the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great service.  They won't try to sell you anything that you don't need.  If you prefer to have a different types of tires that goes to your vehicle, they will tell you why and why not it works or don't work on the car.  They want what's best for your vehicle.  They don't work on commissions, so feel free to ask as many questions as you possibly have.  I recently bought 4 tires for 2 of my vehicles for the President's Day special.  It's good deal when you know what you are doing.  Give them a try if you haven't done it before.  I know I'll go back again for more of their great services. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm typically a fan of Rubio's.  I've been to many of their locations.  However, this one disappointed.  I ordered:\n\nSteak Burrito Especial, $6.99\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=ZOzRhgzHjp_MipYqG2Kn6A#ZOzRhgzHjp_MipYqG2Kn6A\n\nSteak Street Taco, $1.89\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA#4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA\n\nThe food came out in a short time.  While I was waiting, I went to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of their spicy Salsa.  The first item I ate was the Steak Street Taco....the meat was dry and Guacamole was bland.  I poured a lot of the Salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture.  Very disappointing.\n\nNext, I had the Burrito.  That was dry too!  Even with the Sour Cream in the Burrito, it was dry...the Steak, Rice, Beans...all was dry.  Needless to say, I used a heavy dose of Salso on that as well.  To make it worse, the Chips that came with the Burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale...so they were chewy...that means they combined new, fresh Chips with a batch of old ones....bummer.\n\nOne positive thing is that the service here was outstanding.  The cashier was very friendly and had a nice, welcoming smile.  I also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine....the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one.\n\nI'll have to come back and give this place another try, it may have been an off day for them.\n\nReturn Factor - 60% <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My wife and I have always liked the cable repair personnel but the customer service has always been the biggest joke- wrong departments , dropped calls, crazy appointment problems. I'm a small businessman who has sadly come to the conclusion that large corporations that dominate a market have no incentives to provide good service,customer communication, and reasonable prices. Time Warner Cable has done a horrible job of operating in this area although I fear that   the competitors are any better. A tollfree guy told me about \""claiming\"" to have an appointment I scheduled and wanted to know who I wanted to talk to- I said whoever can help me fix my problem- he then asked what department that was and in the transfer the line went dead. Its a sorry corporation that doesn't care about customer dissatisfaction, and wasted time spent by the consumer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  NEVER USE THIS PLACE. DO NOT RECOMMEND. THEY DO NOT FOLLOW UP, ASSOCIATES ARE RUDE, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. HARD TO BELIEVE HOW THEY STAY IN BUSINESS. I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON BOOKS FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD ARRIVE IN TWO DAYS. DUE TO THEIR INCOMPETENCE I AM NOW HAVING TO DROP A CLASS.\nI am very upset and disappointed with the service that I have received. I was told by Frank the order would be placed on 8/27 and the order would arrive on 8/29.  Now, almost two weeks later, my order still has not arrived. And the order was placed on 8/28 instead of 8/27.  I have had to call every day to check on status, no one until today, after calling every day since last Friday has reached out to me. The customer service is not what I expected. These books were needed last Friday for a class that meets on Mondays.  I will be two weeks behind since they will not come in until this Monday. This is unacceptable. If I had known that, I would have used another company to receive my books on time. Now, I do not have time to obtain the books from any other source before Monday.  This has been a major inconvenience for me and I will know not to use your business in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I spend too much of my waking hours at this mixed office/retail space and I pay $75/month for garage parking in a city where parking is usually free so naturally I can't be completely objective about this review.  Generally, it's Outdated, with too many empty suites, and expensive parking.\n\nTake a look at the restaurants that somehow survive or haven't.... Houston's moved across the street, McCormick & Schmicks remains empty, and so does the space that housed a chain steakhouse that anchored one end. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try. My first impression walking in was \""eh\"" could be better, could be worse. The service, however- Couldn't get any worse. I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work, but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves!\n\n I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH!!! Nothing good about that thing. I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla. She made me a full sized instead. This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful. The quesadilla was pretty darn good! Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What a waste of time/money. The menu pictures of the food look delicious, but what I got was completely different!!!!! \n\nI wanted it to be tasty....but I got some slapped together shrimp tacos with...white rice? White rice and butter. Crunchy..BLEH.\n\nI was expecting lots of shrimp for the expensive plate I bought. I got tiny little shrimpies....DON'T DEPRIVE ME OF MY SHRIMP! I love shrimp. Anyway, so bland....no flavor....so LITTLE food....I am not one to eat a lot, I just was expecting a bigger portion for what I paid for\n\nI feel like a jerk every time I rate a place low. But The thing is, when I dislike something, the first thing that comes to my head is: I gotta tell other yelp about my terrible experience!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Based on reviews I thought the food would be excellent both in flavor and quality. We had carne asada tacos and there was almost no flavor at all. Plus, two of the tacos had big pieces of gristle that were unedible. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is probably my favorite place to eat in C-U.  I come from Boston, the land of 100 Indian restaurants.  I fell in love with Indian there, and was very wary of moving to a tiny midwestern city.  However, Bombay definitely hits the spot.  I like the typical curry dishes, chicken tikka masala, samosas, naan - all are great here.  My husband is a bit more adventurous and he has never been disappointed.  Granted, it's not better than many of the places we've been to in Boston - but it's way better than I expected for around here!  On the down side, it's pretty small and very crowded around lunch time.  Good luck finding space for more than just 2 at noon! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i don't understand why this place always gets such good reviews everywhere. i guess the fact that it's not panda express or pei wei gets it some bonus points but honestly the food isn't that great. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The green corn tamale with green sauce was awesome!  I came in after the lunch crowd so it wasn't really busy, but service was lacking. \n\nIt seemed that \""regulars\"" got more attentive service and I had to ask for everything, more water, utensils, clean plate, no one came by to check on the table after I was served until I was finished, etc...\n\nIt would be worth another try and if nothing improves, I'll write it off completely. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm not sure why I even tried giving this business another shot. What a waste of time. \n\nThey advertise for window tinting, so my husband and I decided to go in for a quote and possibly schedule a time to do it. We asked for a price quote from the counter and with the price and the brand of tint they use, we were happy and decided to schedule a time immediately. At that point, the lady at the counter said she needed to call the guy that did the tinting. [sketch moment #1]\n\nShe called and he was apparently able to come in immediately, which at that point was fine, we just needed to run our last errand before we got stuck there for several hours. As we were leaving, we were informed that we had to pay in cash, and couldn't use a card because this individual doesn't actually work for the car wash......we explained that we didn't have cash on us, and the lady at the counter kept insisting that we could just go get some cash. [sketch moment #2]\n\nAfter we left, we had gotten such a bad vibe from that, we decided to not go along with the appointment and immediately called to cancel. During that phone call I explained that we were no longer to to get the window tint (this was within 5 minutes of us leaving there) and THEN, she tells me that they CAN take a card for payment! \n\nWhat the hell kind of business are you running? They also claim to have a warranty on the tint, but if the jobs are being completed by someone who doesn't even work for the car wash, who is in charge of covering any type of warranty? NEVER AGAIN. This isn't breaking bad, stop trying to do shady work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I recently rented a car while in the area for Thanksgiving. I left my Tablet in the back seat of the car and when I tried to get it returned it just vanished. Supposedly they looked for it and didn't find it anywhere. So if you decide to rent from them never ever leave anything behind or it will magically disappear. Yes it's not there problem but it should have been handled better. Lesson learned, hope whoever took my tablet needed it more then me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  $9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \""Paradise City\"" with the rest of the crowd. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The ground's gone sour at this plantation. The coffee isn't the best, but if carrot cake is your scene, man, then it's worth checking out. \n\nLocated at the Biltmore Fashion Park, parking is usually an issue. Since they're open until midnight, you can get a decent parking spot sometime around half an hour before closing. \n\nThe crew on hand is usually a little surly and sometimes a little scary. I've coined a new word that will cover this breed of counter worker: \""scurly\"". Maybe it's not new, nor does it make any sense but in my fragile mind, it sums up the attitude I usually encounter on the rare occasions I go anymore. \n\nAs I just mentioned, they are open until midnight so it's a decent place to go meet up with some friends after hours if you aren't a fan of bars and smoke... or Denny's and Applebees... or good coffee. I ripped my pants on a jagged piece of metal protruding from a broken chair here once, so they lose another star for that... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have eaten there several times during the day and early evening , the foods has always good , and the service has always be delightful, friendly and fast. I can't comment on the late night crowd but I can see it getting rather loud and, crowded and wild but thats a College thing , I assume it would have been a great place for me  years ago <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not only is the pizza scrumptious their service is great. Pats isn't a chain so it is like a homey pizza haven in Boston. An adorable little shop where you can break bread with sauce and cheese and feel content. Pats Pizza Plus is an outstanding pizza shop that me and my family love! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok, clearly the writers of previous reviews are desperately hungry for entertainment.  I just went through this \""zoo\"" yesterday, and I found it nothing more than a bunch of displays with 1 or less animals in them.  The animals always huddled towards the back of the areas making them completely unviewable.  I guess it was a zoo of Rocks n Sticks.\nFurthermore, the prices for food (this isn't a suprise) is not just a ripoff, it's nothing short of thievery!  No one item of food was worth what they wanted.\nPlain and simple - go find somewhere else to entertain yourself... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like this place... It's not the best used book store I've ever been into, but it's a quaint little place and the people who work here are really awesome people. \n\nIf you are looking for used books of various genres (nothing too old) then this will be a great little pit stop. I like to stop by if I'm heading over to Viet Thai or Musashi's and I've placed a to go order I am waiting on.  I took my grandmother here a few months ago and found a group of books from an author I used to collect. My copies have started falling apart and I grabbed what I thought I needed. Unfortunately it wasn't the right one and they had already sold the right one when I stopped by later to get it. So they kindly took my name and number and said whenever they came across it again they would give me a call. I obviously had forgotten all about it and then yesterday they called me up and said they had it behind the desk for me. How awesome is that :-)  \n\nThe prices can't be beat and you can really find some gems if you search. It is small as some people have claimed, but it's a great place to exchange books and find new things.  I highly recommend giving it a try. I know one customer complained about there being too many romance novels and yes there are quite a few but honestly they have lots of other things too!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ace's employees have been incredibly helpful and nice every time I've gone to the store. The store itself is chock-full of great home- and yard-improvement stuff (tools, accessories, gadgets, etc), and the prices are very fair (especially when one considers the convenience of Ace's location and the idea of supporting a local business). For most of my small-to-medium-size home and yard needs, I'll skip the trip to Home Depot or Menards and stick to my neighborhood Ace Hardware. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  People who give the Phoenix Zoo 5 stars have never been to a world class zoo like San Diego.  If you have kids this is a great place to take them since there are  a lot of things for them to do.  For adults, not much to see and the zoo itself is small. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a guest review from my wife Jodi, who grew up within walking distance of the Little Pink Doughnut Shop and came here often on her way to school and on weekends.\n\n\""Best doughnuts created by man.  I'm totally thinking about flapping my wings up to Pittsburgh right now at 2am to get some donuts.  Super-delicious.\n\nThey usually only have doughnuts until about 8 in the morning and they are SO DELICIOUS!  I used to get my lazy ass up at 6am to walk here and get some doughnuts, which is saying something because I like to sleep until 1pm.  I'd be like, 'Oh, it's a day ending in Y, I need to get my ass to the little pink doughnut shop.'\n\nThe doughnuts are so good I got the school bus driver to stop.  I offered to buy him one if he'd just stop long enough for me to go in, and he totally did.\n\nGo get some! Why are you still reading?\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went with a party of four, and was the only one not to order the chicken fried steak - - rather, my heart was set on chicken fried chicken.  Now, I'm not a gravy person, so I ordered my chicken w/o gravy.  This was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken I've ever eaten.  The breading had ZERO seasoning in it, and the chicken was not seasoned.  While it was moist, it required generous amounts of tabasco to make it edible.  What a let down.  The buttermilk biscuit was good...and that was all I'd describe as above average. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate to give this BK a 2-star review - I really, really do, because the folks I have encountered in the drive-thru and dine-in has been exceptionally friendly.  However, the food is definitely meh.\n\nFor a drive-thru dinner, the chicken sandwich was fair - a little light on the mayo and heavy on the lettuce.  Fries were a little soggy.  For a dine-in breakfast, the young lady assisting was very, very nice, but my 2 for $3 ham and cheese crossanwiches were YUCK.  The ham was burned around the edges, so it tasted like coal.  The cheese was super melty, so the sandwich pretty much fell apart the minute I bit into it.  I ate one but could not force myself to eat even part of the second.  I was in a crunch for time, so just went on my way and struck BK off of my list for fast food breakfast stops near home.  Breakfast gets a 1, dinner gets a 2. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best hot and sour soup this side of town. Their egg foo young Cantonese style is unbeatable and their moshu is fantastic. The only thing I think could be improved is their egg rolls sort of taste like out of the box not. Homemade. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... \n\nI am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My 3 day visit to PHX concluded here, and a worthy finale it was. Really, it is quite nice and completely worthy of the 5 star \""as good as it gets\"" designation in its category. Educational (for me and Mr. Amalia C, presumably also for kids) with hands-on activities along the routes, nicely curated displays, and obviously some cra-a-a-zy cacti. It is pricy but don't forget to use that (unadvertised) AAA discount. Also take along water as I found some of the fountains non-functional. We spent about 90 minutes here and didn't really rush or need more time (however, skipped the wildflower exhibit as were told nothing much was blooming, and the butterfly zone was closed for the off season). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I cringed when I saw that their BBQ buffet price went up to $24/person, considering that I can go to a seafood buffet 10 minutes away for much less. Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. \n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). \n\nOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh. For being the only Korean BBQ buffet place in the area, it deserves a standing ovation. I had a great time at Sushi Kim and would gladly recommend the Korean BBQ buffet special. Buffet price was a bit high though, so crack open that piggy bank! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Since I moved to San Francisco, I have sometimes contemplated going to Phoenix, buying as many Rito's burritos as I could afford, and bringing them back to my freezer for emergencies.  I LOVE this place.  This is real Mexican food.  They serve salad with the Mexican food here in the bay.  If this place opened up on Geary in SF, there would be lines around the block!  Have a Red Chili and bean burrito enchilada style with a taco.  You will come back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place was awful , I was there for rehab  the therpists were ok ,there were some awesome Cna's  the food service was really bad no selection and tasted like shit. I wouldnot recommend this place to anyone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good Italian. The portions are very large, so do not be tempted by the bread early. My fianc\u00e9 and I shared two appetizers and an entree. The entree also gives a huge bowl of salad and penne alla vodka. This was so much food, we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. I would absolutely recommend this place, but would suggest pacing yourself. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good doughnuts! Only purchased the glazed but if you heat it up it's oh so good. Also, the cinnamon roll was delightful. Not a fan of their cookies, but hey everything else is very good. If you have a sweet craving, this is definitely a top spot to come pig out at. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very rude and unprofessional guy! Not willing to work out anything with the customer. Very short on the phone. I called for some appliance repair... Called back after almost a week and flat out said he was booked for over a week. He did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time. Would not recommend this company to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I agree with most reviews on here that the food is good, but the service is horrible and I will not go back here again. I placed our order for take out and sat down and wait. I waited for over one hour and the cashier totally forgot to call out our number . The food was just sitting on the counter. After watching other people who came in after us getting their food, I walked up and she said that she forgot to call out our number. What the f? If your job is to take orders and then give it to the customers, then do it right. I will not come back to this place EVER again. Go to Windy City Express if you want good food and timely service! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great layout, very nice bar/restaurant and good people.\n\nThe layout is fair and wisely not long. IMHO any idiot can make a course tough by making it long. Bridges is within the ability of most golfers and yet is challenging enought for, say, a college team (that I recently watched). \n\nMy only criticism is that it is not an easy course to walk with long distances between holes. I think courses should be walked. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First time here and from out of state, so of course we saw it on man vs food and wanted to check it out. Place is pretty cool as far as decoration but the food was awful. We had barbecue, nachos, hot wings, and the chipotle pasta (with cut up hot dog in it). Worst barbecue ever. Seemed like it was made a week ago and microwaved. Nice place to have a drink and watch a game, but avoid the food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Eek... avoid! We walked into Shooters Express Gun Shop looking to pop off a few rounds. The range is in the back of the shop, ensuring that you walk through the retail portion. There are two separate ranges, one for rifles/shotguns and one for handguns. \n\nWe checked in with the range master and he asked if it we had safety cards. We didn't, as this was our first visit. He handed us a business card sized safety card and told us to fill in the info (name & birthday). That was it. I'm not sure what video the others are referring to, as we didn't watch it. \n\nThe range itself had terrible ventilation. No air conditioning/cooling just a fan that didn't oscillate. Sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun. No bueno. The lighting was poor. \n\nMy biggest complaint is pricing. $18 per hour per PERSON... with an one hour minimum. Most indoor ranges charge by lane, not person. Plus... they charge for targets... Customer service was poor and unfriendly. $40 for two people to shoot for less than 30 minutes (we brought our own guns & ammo, otherwise that figure would be way higher). \n\nThe bathroom was gross. With how much money they are making at the range, you would figure they could at least spruce up the bathroom a bit. I've been to a fair share of indoor shooting ranges across the country and this was by far the least impressive! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have received poor service from this KFC location many times. Ranging from no napkins at the drive-thru (a big pet peeve of mine!), old and/or overdone food to receiving food that I didn't order, and not getting what I DID order!\n\nToday I asked for \""extra\"" lettuce on my Twister Wrap with the hopes that I would actually get a decent amount of lettuce. When I got back to the office and opened it, there was not a single shread of lettuce - not even a rogue piece that could have been rolled into the wrap from the counter. (I know... gross!)\n\n$3.50 for 1 tortilla with 2 chicken strips, 2 very small slices of tomato and a little pepper sauce - I can do this (and much better) at home!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hello, I have a rental home and my home warranty used Lee Collins. They came out to fix it a few times over the summer and then finally said it was not worth fixing and they Home warranty gave me a $500.00 credit towards a new one. I had Lee install a new Trane 3 ton for around $3,500. It never worked correctly and my renter always complained about her high bill and no cold AC. Finally a new tech from another AZ company realized it was installed wrong. The air duct returns. So thats why the bill has been high and no cold AC with brand new unit. I'm not sure they know what they are doing. Sorry Lee but all true. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate all Apple Stores.  They are all the same.  Yes, I use a PC and would never use a Mac for anything, but I do love my iPod(s).  This location is pretty high up there in terms of irritability.  There's always some strange, huge cluster of people congesting the back of the store along with the prerequisite losers who come here to surf the internet.  The employees here drive me nuts.  They are either completely lazy or obnoxiously pushy with their \""genius\"" title.  I refuse to call them that and find it embarrassing when one of these so-called \""geniuses\"" knows less about the product than I do.  Aside from that, I also can't stand their new check-out procedure where I have to find an employee and get them to take my card and then proceed to take 10 minutes just to make the transaction.  The only Apple store I didn't try to kill anyone in has been the one at San Tan Village.  They're a little less douchey there.  Ugh!  Only go if you have to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service. \n\nI was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.\n\nShe said she could not do that. No substitutions.\n\nSo, I asked \""why?\"" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.\n\nHer reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.\n\nHuh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?\n\nI tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.\n\nYep, I might tell other people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Recently went because I had heard that it was under new ownership and wanted to see if it had changed.  We went a few years ago and the food was good but the service was just ok.  Since the last time we were there the place is clean and everyone is very nice.  We love their food as it is your traditional classic american food.  We look forward to the new volleyball courts and wish the new owners luck.  I recommend the tex burger. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been using Enterprise at CLT for years (mom lives there). I have always had very friendly and helpful customer service. I reserve on line and always pick the car I want (hint - don't think that the small car is the best value, do your homework and you won't get dinged at the airport). I have full insurance coverage so I always decline. To those of you who complain about getting upsold - It's their job! Just say \""no\"" and move on. No one (NO ONE) has ever pressured me at Enterprise once I clearly said no (that has happened at other places). Service is almost always fast (CLT has been undergoing renovations since the Dark Ages so it can be challenging for anyone to get around that airport) and it is sometimes not their fault if they have problems getting to the terminal quickly.\n\nI once had a minor damage report and had to get the car repaired on my insurance. Worked out okay, but everything gets transferred to contractors for this so it definitely adds to the hassle.\n\nOh, and at CLT there are a number of convenient gas stations on the way to the airport (I use Wilkenson Blvd. access) so don't worry about the gas. You can top off right outside the airport and save the aggravation of wondering what to do.\n\nI have rented a lot of cars from a lot of companies and places and I always expect this to be a good experience and so far (after many at bats) Enterprise CLT is batting close to 1000. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I give this local neighborhood hot spot five stars. Owned by Pizzeria Bianco's Chris Bianco, this sandwich/panini joint bakes fresh bread daily made fresh to go, and although the menu is limited usually to three sandwiches and a foccacia bread, it's well worth it. The Market Sandwich which can change is always my favorite. From fresh mozzarella and tomato to superb meats, they can never go wrong. This is a great in and out spot and there is only outdoor seating next to Lux Coffee bar. They also offer salads, fresh baked bread, fig jam and chocolates. I highly recommend this hot spot! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disgusting. Typical cheap, dirty, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Clean your damn restrooms! Chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli. Hot and sour was pure barf. Dark. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Totally awesome experience. We decided to celebrate our anniversary here and it was a great choice. Yes, the restaurant is small, but that really doesn't matter as all one needs is one table to seat four people. The waiter was full of helpful hints and suggestions as this was our first visit here. After deciding on a bottle of Chianti, we began with a plate of calamari and a side of garlic bread, hmmmm, yummy. Then we all had different main courses--butternut squash ravioli, spaghetti neri, penne al Santa Fe, and penne al salmone. However, two of us switched to the house fresh pasta, which was awesome. If you have only experienced store-bought pasta then you may not be prepared for the wholesome goodness of true homemade pasta. The flavor of each dish was wonderful. We then indulged in dessert. The creme brulee and key lime tart both were excellent (although we were all stuffed by then). The portions were just right and the whole dining experience was awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. It offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. Still ha that neighborhood feel though. I have never had food there though they offer paninis. Great desserts. Good espressos and okay coffee.Outdoor seating. Good place to study. Plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My boyfriend and I visit LGO often ...maybe TOO often! But I just can't get enough of this little place. If you're looking for a trendy place for a lunch with friends, or even a dinner date, this is it. My favorites are the commuter with salmon and avocado, and the cheeseburgers. The cheeseburgers are amazing...and I don't even LIKE cheeseburgers. I also enjoy their Arnold Palmer's! Hands down, 5 stars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well worth the drive. The best crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e I had so far. The crawfish were so plump and juicy. And the garlic bread.... So delicious. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I went to Presto on a Tuesday night around 6:30. It was very, very bad. Very bad. So very bad that I'm writing my first Yelp review.\n\nSummary: Some of the food was decent, but everything else is so so very very bad that it's not worth it. I will tell people not to go there and I will never go back.\n\n[The BAD.]\n\nThere was one guy playing hostess/waiter/bartender/bus boy, hitherto referred to as HWBBB. \n\nWe went there specifically to sit on the patio because the weather was awesome, but were told we couldn't because the HWBBB was the only one on staff.\n\nThe temperature in the restaurant was HOT. Stifling. Not normal. 70 outside, 85 inside.\n\nThe menu was schizophrenic. I had no idea what to order. Sushi, pitas, pizzas, steak. Plus a \""build a 3-course meal\"" option. I felt like I was reading the menu at Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThey played dance music? Which is just weird in a restaurant setting.\n\nThey were out of several things. I asked the HWBBB, \""What beers do you have on draft?\"" He said, \""We only have 2. We usually have 4 but we ran out of 2 today.\"" So I'm already disappointed and I don't even know what they have yet. My husband ordered a glass of Malbec and the HWBBB came back and said they didn't have it.\n\nMy order was wrong. I ordered a side salad in lieu of fries. I received an entr\u00e9e salad in addition to my meal, which still came with fries. I ordered a chicken kebob sandwich and received a beef kebob sandwich. We decided things were so bad at this point that I didn't tell the HWBBB of his error. I sucked it up and ate the stupid beef.\n\nThe beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality. Maybe stew meat. I chewed each piece the point I'd realize it wasn't going to break down any further and then spit out what remained. I'm usually not such a disgusting dining companion but this place brought out the best in me. I kept wishing for a normal chewable digestible piece but ended up eventually spitting out every single piece of beef.\n\nWe had a groupon and when the HWBBB brought the bill we got lectured on all the items the groupon did not apply towards. Like alcohol (fine) and the $20 3 course meal my husband ordered, \""because that's already a deal, but I'll make an exception, just this once.\""\n\nWe settled the bill before the dessert from my husband's meal came. Our HWBBB was puzzled that we were still sitting there and eventually asked what else he could do for us. We asked if he could bring the dessert we ordered. \n\nThe apple crisp was like flour and sugar mixed with 3 apple chunks, stuck in the microwave on high for 10 minutes, topped with ice cream.\n\n[The not so bad.]\n\nThe beef tasted good, even if I couldn't chew it.\n\nMy husband's shawarma was good.\n\nThe tzatziki sauce was very good.\n\nThe pita bread was good.\n\nThe salads were ok.\n\nThe curly fries that came with our meals were reminiscent of Jack 'n' the box, one of many other places I dislike but would rather have eaten at. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I started a new job downtown (I moved from NYC during the summer), and some coworkers took me here just last week for lunch.  Since the move from NY, I'd been really craving some quality, New York-style pizza, and hadn't had a ton of luck finding any (although the search introduced me to some excellent \""Pittsburgh-style\"" pizza joints, so I'm not complaining.)  \n\nVilla Reale really came through.\n\nI loved that you could order a slice with basically whatever toppings you wanted (I'm used to being at the mercy of whatever \""slice\"" pie has been languishing under a heat lamp for 3 hours).  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage slice, and the small feast that was presented to me did not disappoint.  The slice was huge, the pepperoni crispy, the sauce really balanced (not too sweet, not too garlicy), the cheese fresh and delicious and the crust...oh man...thin and crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside.  One slice was perfect to fill me up for lunch, too.  \n\nFull disclosure: while the wait staff is so friendly, they do get overwhelmingly busy at lunch.  We went to the place at 11:00 so we could sit at a table (if you want to dine-in and order a slice during lunch, you can only sit at the counter, not a table, after 11:30) and by 11:30 the place was standing room only.  My coworkers informed me that somehow, their pizzas are even better when ordered by the pie (hard for me to fathom) and also that their hoagies are delicious, so I'm sure I'll be trying one of those next time.  \n\nIt's not the most inexpensive pizza joint downtown (I think my slice ended up being $4-$4.50) but if you're a recovering Noo Yawker like me looking to fulfill some culinary nostalgia, this is your place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I received a card for this place from a Verizon store when my phone has issues, and i had no insurance. Dan was very quick and repaired my phone for a very nice price! His first fix did not take care of the issue, but after taking it back to him he was able to properly diagnose the issue and resolve it with no extra cost. I would definitely recommend going to see Dan if you have any phone issues. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have purchased many high end pieces of luggage (Tumi, Briggs & Riley) from this location with the understanding that they are adding value to my purchase over that of online or airport retailers should I need a repair as they are certainly not less expensive.  Well One of my B&R bags is in need of repair.  The bag was purchased Dec-2012 so it is not that old and it is indeed covered under the lifetime repair of B&R.   I stopped in today to see what could be done.  They could not repair the bag and did offer to send the bag back to B&R for me for the small fee of $35+tax. Really, I could walk down the road a bit and have the UPS store ship it for half that price.  What value are they providing me?   It is a shame that the brick and mortar stores are unable to provide value over online and this is one easy way to do it.  A Shame since I used to be a really good customer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I guess I took it for granted as it was my first non-RA sushi experience in Arizona.  I love Zen 32, for a lot of reasons, but have a few minor complaints. I think this place is tad bit overpriced, and they do have OK to mediocre service. Overall it's not the best Sushi experience of my life, but it has great specialty rolls, miso soup, and amazing hot green tea. I guess sushi becomes so similar as I try different places around the area, overall Zen 32 has held up as a solid 4 star experience. I would say. you won't be disappointed here, and you will walk away feeling securely sushified. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> At first glance I wasn't too impressed with the buffet, I thought it'd be another botched attempt of authentic Indian food. While the selection is not that impressive, I would say that the quality is pretty damn good. \nI debated for a long time with my friend about the food going back and forth between a 3 and a 4. I ended up going with the 4 due to the Indian tea that they had - hard to find at any buffet!. \nThey aren't trying to wow you with exotic ingredients or fun twists, it's almost as if you're sitting down at someone's house and eating what they'd eat on a regular basis. Plus you're paying around 9 dollars for a buffet, I mean- let's get real. You get what you pay for. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The food is good because newer restaurant. The salad bar is good and at a decent price. The prices are better here,then at the airport. If your waiting around by the airport for someone to come in from where ever. Have eaten at the bar a couple times now and always enjoyed the service and food!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a fan at all. I was looking for a late night Taco stop that would surprise me, in a good way.  The food (Taco and enchilada) had a funky taste, slightly chemical. I threw it out after a few bites. Scottsdale rules for Mexican. You would have to be wasted to think this place was a gem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You cant go wrong....:)))) YAY!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I only come here to get their 99 cent bags of ice that are advertised all over their outside windows. \n\nUnfortunately, out of 6 visits they have only had the bagged ice once. Why??? And offering me a large cup of ice for the same price is not gonna make me happy Mr. Manager. Just bag that ice up.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have eaten here several times. The burgers are always good. I went there last night around 9 PM. I order a double meat hamburger. I must say it was one of the best I have eaten in a while. The service was above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food restaurant. The workers were very friendly and offered to refill our drinks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here because I wanted to try a new salon and I'm glad I did. There was no wait time and the staff was very warm and friendly. I had a pedi and a full set, both look beautiful. It was $25 for a full set with gel and $21 for the pedi. I highly recommend Central Nail. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love. Love. Love this place.\n\nGood prices all day long, but stick around long enough and there will be some random even greater special price of the day.  Love that even on the special prices for cocktails you still get a fairly decent pour.  The patio is great at night for watching all the crazy drivers on Camelback.  Service is always pretty good, and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service.  They have pool tables and tons of TVs.  I've only had one thing here that I didn't like, and that was just a personal preference thing (their nachos are with the cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese) The 1/2 price munchie menu for late night is awesome.  I have a love affair with their Hummus....soooo good!!\n\nDefinitely a place to check out for sure! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went in for Happy Hour. Food was good. Bartender was rude as could be. Curt, snarky, and a short pour on the wine. Clearly annoyed when we had a question about our bill. Shrimp was tasty, thank goodness. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've found the service here to be pretty terrible. Servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences. The food is really pretty good, but if the overall service sucks, then well, it makes it hard to enjoy a tasty meal. Sorry Storm, you need to improve this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Came here for Zoolights... I'll admit, loved the zoo as a child, but at 19, I'm probably the least likely person to ever go to the zoo. To be honest, I hate nature, not a fan of weird animals, and honestly don't care for the smell........Fortunately, I had a great time and would visit again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Can't ask for more when you are not in New York or Los Angeles or San Francisco China towns...however, this place is a must go when you are in Phoenix <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A nice, clean bowling alley.  Most alleys have pretty much the same features as all the rest--lighted lanes at night, birthday parties, pizza and burgers, etc.  At Squaw Peak though, you get it all without the dinge and wear that I usually see at a lot of other bowling alleys.  The bathroom ain't scuzzy, and you don't smell residual 30 year-old cigarette smoke.\n\nI went here with my family last night and had a great time.  After a warm-up, I bowled a 161--the best game I ever played.  I think you'll have fun too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Super disappointed in the phone mannerism of the staff. Can you say \""no thanks.\"" The story:\n\nI found myself in Phoenix, AZ with two bald tires and I really needed to get new ones. The person on the phone was a JERK. He didn't listen even though I told him that I had the tire size off of my tire. He said, \""It may not be the right size, just tell me what car you have you probably don't know what numbers I need.\"" Why? Because I have a va-jay jay? Really!\n\nHe also said that the last person could have used the wrong size... really? I also bought those at a Firestone in San Diego, CA. Nice... talk bad about the people in your network.. makes sense.\n\nSo, I went to a different store where they were awesome. The reviews on this site are spot on for this location. Maybe Firestone should take note that the person answering their phone is an IDIOT and do better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> unlike the shill reviewer for his store across the street,  I've been going here for years.  Great neighborhood location, friendly American barbers, good value for the money.  This IS NOTt a cheap $9 soviet we-buy-gold place for walmart shoppers.  What you get is a good hair cut, by a nice person, in a clean place.  Unlike every other place I've been to in 40+ years, they wash your hair AFTER the cut to get rid of cut bits and looks like you would normally look hitting the road..  Add in a hot towel, head and neck massage, and it makes a stressful day a lot better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After doing some drinking at some other places, we landed at Park House. Load me up with some more drinks and the free popcorn and peanuts (which you can just toss the scraps on the floor). I'm sold!! The beers were reasonably priced and this was the type of place where you can gather with friends and just hang out. No pressure at all. The lighting wasn't too dark so it felt intimate where you were sitting. Seems like a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other. If I find myself in the area again I would head to Park House though there was the occasional creeper but I guess you can find them anywhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Eh... no. This bright colorful restaurant is kind of cute, but the food leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe cheese crisp should be skipped. It's a fried tortilla covered in Velveeta (or some other processed cheese). There's no flavor. Salsa tastes like it's made from canned tomatoes. Chips were fresh, on the plus side.\n\nI think the entrees were better. Chicken chimichanga was OK. The rice was fine, too. Carne asada tacos had a decent tomatillo sauce, but the beef was tough. Black beans seemed canned, but the mixed vegetables were actually pretty good and well seasoned.\n\nPrices were high relative to the food you receive. I don't think I'll be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There have only been two superb fusion restaurants that I have been to in the world. There have been quite a few that were average and some that down right stunk. The problem with most fusion places that they rely on the principal that the sum will equal more than the parts and therefore, the parts do not have to be that good to begin with. Unfortunately Soba falls in that category.\n\nFor example the corn fritters we had, if you tried the fritters on their own they were barely passable, greasy, falling apart and not much flavor - a virtual fritter failure, however you wrap that mess in the bibb lettuce, put on a basil leaf and dip it in the sauce chili-soy sauce and all of a sudden it becomes a tasty little snack. But I still have to ask would this dish not be better if ALL the components were excellent? \n\nThe Thai corn chowder tasted good, but had a funny mouth appeal, grainy and lumpy at the same time and didn't look appetizing brownish yellow. We eat with our eyes, nose, taste and tactile feel so while this tasted good it didn't do so well on the other requirements.\n\nThe mushroom and spinach dumplings were actually very blah, relying on the red pepper dipping sauce for their flavor. However the chopped salad was excellent, so all is not dismal at Soba.\n\nI could go on but you get the idea. The place is expensive for what you get, they should pay more attention to the parts, master making them correctly before you try fusing it into another cuisine to cover up your mistakes. Overall most people are not as picky as I am, we tried, it was good with some problems, problems that should not have been there at their price point.\n\n3.5 stars <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> All you can eat limited sushi on Saturday for around $20. Sold. I crashed Dottsy Z's  party with two other lovely ladies (Hi Amber and Debi) this past Saturday after literally stepping off of a plane and seeing her post that she was here. The funny thing was that I wasn't really hungry, until I saw all the yummy food in front of me. Eel rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Toosie Maki Rolls, Spicy Tuna Rolls, good lawd I was in heaven. I ate so much that I arrived looking \""skinny\"" and I left looking as if I was expecting a baby sometime in the very near future lol. Sad case yes. Our waitress was extremely nice but a little overworked since it appeared as if she was working the entire restaurant solo. So if you are hankering for some sushi, go on a Saturday over to Moto Sushi. But be warned, you must eat everything that you order if you order off the all you can eat, or you will be charged 50 cents per piece that you leave on your plate. So don't overdo it. (We left nada! lol) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had lunch at the Glendale location today. It had been quite a long time since I'd eaten at Pei Wei. It's not the same quality as it was when it opened. In the beginning...the food was barely second to that served at a PF Changs. It was quite good, easy to access and everything that accompanied the food was higher quality (drinks, napkins, fortune cookies, staff/bussers).\n\nI ordered a small chicken orange peel with brown rice ($6.49) and my BF ordered the large shrimp kung pao ($9.99) and we also ordered 2 side spring rolls $3.79. I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w/less expensive prices or portions. For lunch, the small is just fine for most, especially if you get an extra little side with it. \n\nBUT...HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SMALL AND ORIGINAL PORTION SIZE..YOU PAY MORE FOR ADD'L RICE WHEN YOU ORDER THE ORIGINAL, NOT ADD'L MEAT.\n\nPlate next to plate my BF had the same amount of meat (shrimp) in comparison to my (chicken)...his plate was larger and it had more than twice the amount of rice on my plate. So comparing apples to apples you pay $2 to $2.20 more for MORE rice, not necessarily more meat when you order an original vs a small depending on what kind of meat you order. \n\nSo...Just wanted to give you the heads up when you consider ordering small or original. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What an absolutely delightful and special dining experience!  Our family of four went there for dinner this past Friday night.  Brought along  two  bottles of wine, which is such a nice bonus. Much cheaper and we were able to bring wines that we enjoy.  The decor is lovely, very bohemian and cozy.  Just magical.  Our server was Bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  The food is Portuguese, which is primarily fish based, so we ordered accordingly. To start we ordered the cod fritters, the grilled octopus and a special salad of the night, farm grown tomatoes with Roquefort cheese.  All very delicious!  Main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous flavor), the impeccable seafood stew and the salmon, also lovely.  Just a perfect relaxing meal in every way.  If you live in Pittsburgh and have not been, this place is a gem. Worth checking out.  Wish we lived closer (we are DC based). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 4.5 stars! Picked up a pizza and small order of garlic knots. I have no idea how big their large is, but the small order was definitely enough for 4 people. Comes with a side of delicious marinara also. Our pizza was pepperoni and mushroom and it was great, too. The pizza crust was not soggy at all. We loved it and wouldn't have found it without yelp :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, The Milestone is a dive bar that does punk, metal and rock shows. The cover is usually pretty cheap, the beer is REALLY cheap, the sound system is OMG LOUD! and the place sure has a lot of character. It's the kind of place native Charlotteans think of fondly because they snuck in to see Black Flag when they were 15 back in 1983. Or had their first sexual and\\or alcohol experience in the parking lot. Or some such other fond teen memory that makes them overlook the place's serious shortcomings.\n\nFor those of us who are Charlotte transplants? It's... something. Let me say this: the bathrooms here are (by FAR) the nastiest in Charlotte. And I'm a GUY. I can't imagine the poor ladies having to hover over the toilets there, afraid of the as-yet-undocumented pathogens lurking on the seat. Seriously folks, the bathrooms here are BEYOND NASTY! And points off for cutting out indoor smoking. They used to not care about the NC statewide ban on indoor smoking (\""yeah, like the cops ever come HERE\"", the bartender told me), but a few months ago they decided to ban it... thus removing the one thing I really liked about it. \n\nDon't get me wrong folks. If you go there with good friends to hear a good band you'll have a fun time. It's just that now that I'm 41 years old I'm a bit less tolerant of subpar facilities than I used to be, <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After researching indie shops on various sites including yelp and m3forum, I decided to take my '04 M3 to Bavarian.  I had a pretty vigorous oil leak and wanted them to install a new fuel filter and emergency brake pads.  I dealt with Ray who could not have been more pleasant.  These guys really take their reputation seriously and do thorough, honest work.  They found the leaking component and called me before doing any work.  Their prices were reasonable, a fraction of what the dealer would have charged and no doubt with much better and personal customer service.  They kept me posted on progress and completed the work sooner than expected.  Ray was just terrific to work with and though I will continue to do my own regular maintenance, anything else that comes up will be done at Bavarian no doubt.  Thanks guys, I'll def recommend you on the M3/BMW on line forums as people are often asking for local indie shop recs! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  True story (and I hope someone from HBP sees this): I walk in the story today and ask the clerk for any books about celiac disease. She gives me a blank stare like it's a new band she hasn't heard of. \""It's a dietary condition where you can't eat wheat or gluten, you know that gluten-free thing?\"" It still doesn't register. No light bulb. I volunteer a suggestion: \""The health section?\"" She refers me to the cookbooks. Seriously. I'm not making this up. Considering the number of restaurants that now have gluten-free options, I would recommend - other than buying some of their staff a clue - having a \""celiac\"" book descriptor somewhere in the shelves. It's nearly impossible to find a book about celiac (and I'm pretty sure there *are* books about celiac) in HBP. Not the best place to go if you're looking for non-fiction books about celiac: lights on, but nobody home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I know this is a chain and found that there is one in SF. We ended up coming here for a late lunch after picking up the husband and daughter from the airport when they flew into Phoenix to celebrate my Gram's 90th. My mom had yet to come here and the fact that this used to be Houston's which used to be located across the street which well, everything that once was has changed in Phoenix. \n\nMy mom ordered the artichoke and claimed it was one of the best she ever had. I had one of the best house side salads ever. It had all sorts of goodies from beets to goat cheese to hidden gems of avocado. Perfect. The husband had a French Dip he said he would fly back to have again and the DD ordered seared Ahi (she is much more adventurous than I) and loved it. \n\nService was friendly, we left full and I look forward to another experience with Hillstone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This bare- bone market is a tiny slice of Eastern Europe in Phoenix.

This is also where you can go when only Hungarian paprika will do.\n\nAlso have fun selection of chocolate and candy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I feel as though I needed to write this review. This is just tragic that such a prime  location on the lake has terrible food, service, and if that isn't enough, even their drinks are so so...live in town and never been happy with the food. Only up is the location!!! Do not waste $$ on food!! I have had \nRibs: too soft and drenched in BBQ sauce\nFish sandwich: fish sticks.. Brown lettuce \nHamburger: dry bun, no flavor..\nWings: the worst, slimy \n\nAnd others as well.. \n\nYou've been warned!!\n\nBest and only thing is good music, nice deck w water views and drinks on a summer night or day.. Live music is fun.. Awesome for hanging out w drinks.. Not a food place <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A welcome contrast to the sprawling blandness of its neighbors-the strip malls, the Paradise Valley mall, Costco-is the small but shapely Mesquite Branch Library. It was designed by Will Bruder, the don of Phoenix architecture who also gave us the Burton Barr Library. Much smaller than its cousin, the Mesquite Branch still manages to provide decent functionality within its attractive facade.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time in the the library this summer trying to cut my utilities bill. I felt they always had the AC pumping adequately. Finding a seat, however, was sometimes a problem. There just isn't enough table space. The library seems focused on serving children, to whom most of the free space is dedicated. It's hard to complain too much about that.\n\nFor adults, there are plenty of DVDs and audio recordings. The spotty book selection is bolstered by the interlibrary loan system. The newspaper selection is OK but the magazine shelf is poor. In the Used Book Corner, I can always find one or two great books for under a $1. If you have a laptop you should bring it, since the line for the computers is always long.\n\nDespite being designed to serve a much smaller community, and undergoing serious budget cuts, the Mesquite Branch still serves the area well. And it does so with great visual flair. In addition to the architecture, Lewis Alquist's Whorlpath-an outdoor garden with terrazzo patio-is a great place to relax with a book. Weather permitting, of course. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Being a long time fan of Outback, I decided to try it for lunch.  Not such a great idea, as it turns out.  They offer unlimited soup and salad, for $7.99 and a few selected other items that can be paired with soup or salad. Bottom line, you are nickel and dimmed to death.  If you want a Wedge Salad (as opposed to a House or Caeser Salad), it costs $1.00 more; if you want French Onion Soup (as opposed to Baked Potato Soup), it will cost you a $1.00 more; if you want cheese on your burger, it will cost you a $1.00 more.  These extra charges were annoying and seemed unnecessary.   \n\nThe Caeser Salad had way too much dressing, the Baked Potato Soup was way too salty and the Outback burger was way too dry (maybe I should have paid the extra buck and got cheese!). \n\nI will stick to dinner at Outback, from now on. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After seeing a movie at the nearby Harkins, my family and I went there for my cousin's birthday dinner. We picked this place based on the positive online reviews. The place was unimpressive looking, but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign (nobody lines up and waits for bad food...or at least they shouldn't). After half an hour we got seated. They placed us in what looked like an addition to the building and it was freezing! They had the A/C blasting and a ceiling fan going. Our server was very nice, and our drinks and salads came out rather quick. Then it took a turn for the worse. Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food. And the food was pretty mad. We ordered spaghetti, eggplant parmesan, and the manicotti. Ragu tastes better than the sauce that they seemingly have an neverending supply of. And the eggplant was mushy and unflavorful. To add insult to injury, the prices were absurd! They charged prices on par with higher end Italian restaurants...yet this place is a far cry from anything upscale. Maybe this place is only good for the pizza, but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The portions are huge. Reasonable price. The fish I ordered was decent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When it comes to pizza....I am a snob. After tasting the food of the gods direct from NY, I have yet to find a suitable facsimile in other parts of the country. I will say that NYPD comes pretty dang close. Even some of my friends from the east coast can attest that it is \""pretty close to NY pie\"". I am partial to eating pizza like a fat kid so when I get a slice of sicilian in front of me you would think that the zombie apocalypse was right around the corner. \nThe prices are fair for what you get and I highly recommend eating carbs with your carbs and order yourself the cheese covered garlic knots. If anything, you will be vampire proof for at least 24 hours.\nSome locations have a great Happy Hour and an acceptable set up for alcohol.\nGo, eat, love, regret and do it all over again.\n\nBoo to the yah. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have found all the trophy wives in the Biltmore area.  They're at the Camelback Village.\n\nI'm pretty young still.  I'm in my 20s, and I'm used to being one of the most energetic, fit people in my group fitness classes.  I showed up at the Village dance classes expecting this trend to continue.  Nope.  The standard age at the Village seems to be 35-50 years old, but it caters to the 35-50 year old MARATHON RUNNERS.  I'm pretty sure that the dance classes are filled with ex-cheerleaders and professional dancers.  The Yoga \""students\"" could teach classes at most other gyms, and the rockin' ladies in the Kinesis class have six packs.  I'm not even joking.\n\nWe tried some of the cheaper, more traditional gyms in the area before deciding on the Village, but the large number of diverse class offerings daily, the gorgeous facilities (I feel like I'm in a spa when I take a shower there after a workout!) and the sheer number of fitness options led us to the decision to pay the extra money in exchange for a better quality, fitter lifestyle.\n\nWant a tennis partner?  The club will set you up with a league.  Like to shoot hoops?  There are organized pick-up games as well as competitions for all ages (or there will be again soon - unfortunately the flood damaged the basketball courts, but they're already at work replacing them).  Swimmer?  No prob - masters swim classes and swim team, led by ex-collegiate swimmers.  Hiker?  There are morning running and hiking clubs.  \n\nHere's what else I've discovered so far: ping-pong tables, racquetball courts, squash courts (apparently they're two different games - who knew!), Kinesis and bootcamp classes (Crossfit without the brand name), various dance classes ranging from Zumba to Belly-Dancing, Bounce Classes on trampolines.  Also, nutrition experts, personal trainers, well-supplied weight rooms, cardio rooms, an indoor running track, and the evil \""kinesis room\"" which looks all innocent but then kicks your butt.  Also, free ice water and coffee at all times of day.\n\nDo you just want to booze it up and get massages while your partner works out?  Good news - there's a full-service bar and a relaxing spa!  There's also a big screen TV where you can watch sports games (tennis is given preference, but football and basketball have been on recently too) as well as smaller TVs in the locker-rooms - and don't get me started on the locker rooms.  Iced towels, mouthwash, razors, and pretty much any beauty item you'd need to get ready for work in the morning.\n\nI'm still amazed by this place every time I go, and I've been going daily.  The steep price tag is worth every penny. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was my first time visiting Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. I thought that the concept of a noodle bar was interesting. \n\nI was kind of unimpressed by the lunch menu. There weren't that many options and I had a hard time finding anything that jumped out at me. Many of the lunch options were for rice or salad. I really wanted noodles, ie a noodle bar. \n\nI went for a Udon Combo Special with a California Roll. The roll was whatever, but the chicken in my soup was basic and kind of bland. \n\nThe food was average, but it was the service that left me unimpressed. The waiter was short and was very impersonal. He made my table feel rushed and as if we were an inconvenience for patronizing the restaurant. When we were ready to pay our bill, we asked for a spit check and he proceeded to tell us that he \""couldn't do tax in his head\"" so basically too bad. We decided to spit the check 4 ways to be as easy as possible. Then as we were leaving he reprimanded us for not asking for a spit check before hand. I think it would have been nice for a server to be observant and ask us if we needed that rather than expect the table to make that known. A little foresight and customer service would have made a huge difference. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's a flea market.  Nothing more; nothing less.  It's old crap that no one should need unless you are a hoarder.  There are plenty of free flea markets and yard sales that are free.  This misadventure cost me $20 in admission fees.  What a waste.  It's $10 a head.  Finally, no one takes credit cards... even for the admission charge.  After all, flea markets and yard sales typically deal in cash only.  I now feel slightly dirty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible service. I waited in line a good 15 mins to ask a question with two people at the shoe reg. One which was doing nothing, when I tried to ask, they kindly asked me to wait.... so I did. When the person in front of me was done,  they skipped over me and took the next person... um hello....? I found it very disrespectful. Maybe training staff on customer service is a must... just sayin <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sat at the bar and had Byron, nice guy, waiting on me.  I wasn't too thrilled when I saw that the $5 happy hour red wine selection was a Penfolds (?) cab/shiraz blend, but Byron said it was good, so ordered it.  (I'm not fond of shiraz...)\n\nChose the deep-fried zucchini and the blackened cajun-spiced chicken sandwich with fries off of the $1.95 menu, with the chicken sandwich selection entered first.  It's a good thing I added the zucchini, as it arrived much earlier than the sandwich.  I'd already polished the dish off (nice, light, crispy coating of panko with a side of rather tasteless ranch dressing), as I ended up waiting another 8 to 10 minutes for the sandwich to arrive.  The sandwich was good (loved the spice rub!), allthough I had to throw away the **.  Still a good-portioned meal without the omitted items, as it came with a side of fries.\n\nDidn't feel comfortable enough to take photos of the food... Don't know why as I usually don't let what others think influence my actions, but there you have it.  I think happy hour at Roaring Fork's spoiled me a little bit... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \""You look oriental, but you also look American.\"" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \""Why don't you try this instead,\"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \""sell by\"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you. <|endoftext|>

My stay was on a Thursday night, and had a room on the 10th floor facing East.\n\nIt's located right down town in the theater area, and it's an extremely easy walk to a lot of essentials. There are convenience stores a couple buildings down, and tons of bars and restaurants to check out all around.\n\nThe valets at the front door are extremely polite and will open the doors for you and call you a cab if you need it, and the front desk people are extremely friendly and will help you with whatever you need.\n\nThe rooms are great, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms have large desks, which are great if you are doing paperwork or have to setup to do some business work in your room. TV's are great and have good programming, the beds are super comfy, and the bathrooms are large with good showers.\n\nAfter being here, this is probably the only hotel in Pittsburgh that I will ever want to stay at again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First off, a heads up. Though the business is listed here as Salsa's, it's now actually Cabo's. \n\nI stopped here spur of the moment for takeout lunch and ended up ordering the Chicken Taco Salad. It wasn't exactly what I was used to--the black beans and chicken were both hot. I prefer my taco salad cold because lettuce with really warm food is a little gross, so I ended up sticking it in the fridge to cool down before eating more. \n\nI'll give them credit for the serving size (and the chips made for a nice snack later on). However, I wasn't overly impressed with the service. I was charged for the dinnertime salad rather than the lunch one (keep in mind I came in at 1PM), but the guy at the counter wouldn't admit to it. What happened to the mantra, \""The customer is always right?\"" I'm no Albert Einstein, but just eyeballing the receipt (and with the help of my handy calculator), it wasn't hard to figure out that I was.\n\nOk, ok...time to cool off! All in all, I was only charged $1.00 extra, but it was a complete turnoff that the Cabo employee wasn't being honest and tried to make up a mysterious extra charge. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Soba is Big Burrito's take on Asian fusion.  As with everything concerning Big Burrito, Soba is excellent in all departments.  It is next door to Umi (Big Burrito's sushi place) in a trendier area of Shadyside.\n\nThe space is elegant--a waterfall adorns the interior.  Lighting is dark as is the decor--as with most Big Burrito establishments.  There is plenty of space between tables and such--you can take a date here and you should.\n\nThe food is excellent.  Dishes are inventive (not your normal Asian fusion dishes here) and well presented.  The quality of the ingredients is top-notch (my tuna tar tare tasted very fresh).  As a note, tasting menus are not available--two specials seemed to offered every night.  The menu seems to change by season as well.\n\nSoba's wine and whiskey selection is extensive--10 pages for wine, 4 for whiskey.  The service is excellent, as is to be expected.  Really, everything here is great.  You should go at least once, Soba is a gem in the rough of the Pittsburgh dining scene. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here for take out and sit down lunches and have been impressed both times. I was pleasantly surprised on my recent lunch trip, as I was offered more than I was for take put. Got the Pad Thai w/chicken both times. Great price of $7.95, but when you sit down it also comes with iced tea and a bowl of soup. Soup was a corn based egg drop soup, which was different, but good. You also get a small egg roll. Yep...$7.95! Service is fast too! Enjoy! I'll be back soon :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the \""normal\"" Italian restaurant offers. \n\nI had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.\n\nUpon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \""Holy Oil\"" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \n\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\n\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\n\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\n\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know! <|endoftext|>

This time it was just a simple oil and transmission fluid change, and a battery/alternator check.\n\nI love how they come out to the waiting area and teach you about how your car works. It is like they are a surgeon and they are telling you the pros/cons of what needs to be done.\n\nThere is also no pressure to get services done to your vehicle. They will tell you honestly if something needs to be fixed asap, or if it can wait. So far, they have saved me about $300 over what Metro Honda was going to charge me for the same services. They also gave me the option to use Honda parts or 3rd party on a previous issue, which is great because I prefer to use Honda parts. I have no worries when bringing my car here. I know they are going to quote me a fair price, and the work perform is going to be at a higher level than any other place in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went in there for the first time and it sucked! I asked to post a flier about a free dog walk event, but the lady couldn't be bothered and she shook her head at me. I know she was on the phone, but she could have waited until she was off the phone to give service. I was going to buy supplies, but forget it! I could understand them not wanting to post a flier, but they could have done something other than shake their head at me.  Never going back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm from El Paso, Tx & I know well done Mexican food. Rito's is the closest I've found to the real deal here in Phoenix & I've checked out over 25 places here in the sun valley!  Have the green chili burro served enchilada style. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a great place to go for concerts and sporting events. My first time here was for an NSYNC concert back in 2002 and despite having upper-level seats, we could see and hear everything just fine. There's not a bad seat in this place!\n\nThis time, I was here with friends for a Phoenix Mercury game. Fry's was giving away tickets and my friend and I were given Suite tickets! The Suite Level is awesome, but the drawback on this night was the fact no food or concession stands were open on our level so my friend had to go to the Main Concourse to get food.\n\nWe could see and hear everything just fine and I got a lot of pictures. The lighting, however, was dim so pictures came out dim but still decent.\n\nGreat venue and I know i'll be back for more games and concerts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Greasy food, lazy service, flat soda.  For a place the is supposed to specialize in burgers they sucked!  The patty was dry and over cooked everything was greasy, and the only thing that was ok were the fries but that is not a reason to go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great sausage-maker in central Phoenix. Try a few of these instead of what you get at Trader Joe's (which are also good) and you'll never go back. You can get anything here from from andouille to chicken cranberry. The staff are helpful, welcoming, and thorough. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For ramen and broth fanatics, this is literally as good as it gets. Always very busy, and there's a reason for it. PLEASE Cherryblossom, if you're listening, launch a location in OldTown. \n\nCha Shu Ramen #1 must, however definitely go with the egg noodles in this one. Smoky, creamy broth will have you feening. \n\nUdon Suki Pot #2 must, they crack a raw egg on top to finish it off and the broth is so hot it cooks it. Deliciously flavorful beef broth.\n\nSpicy Gyoza Soup Appetizer #3 must. Must. Must. Must. Warning, it is actually extremely spicy, it will make your nose run. But I literally had a couple dreams about it, it was that good. \n\nI actually didn't like the champon noodles very much, but might be a personal preference. The tan-tan men noodles were very good as well. Sushi is decent. Haven't tried the asian-italian fusion dishes but my ex always ordered one and they looked absolutely fantastic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They should call it S&M Wine & Spirits. The worst of the Barriques around.... The attitude from the girls working there! They do everything they can to make you feel you are beneath them. I work in Middleton and was stopping daily until I could not put up with the attitude any more. The final draw was when I stood there at the counter for 20min with other customer behind me waiting while I got to listen to. \""You know\"" \""Oh my god\"" \""She didn't\"". \""really, really\"" \""Oh my god\"" \""He hooked up with who\"". The girl working the cash register would look over at me and the others waiting and roll here eyes as she kept on talking with the barista.... When she did take my order she got it wrong. This is basically what I got for service for weeks, so I don't chalk this up to a single rotten apple. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've flown into and out of Phoenix airport several times in my life.  Well, not me, I've been inside a plane, but you already knew that.\n\nAnyway, the airport is clean, the people working there are nice, and it's one of the major hubs for US Airways.  The terminal we were in had a Starbucks, a Burger King, a Cinnibon and a Mexican spot.  There were a couple of gift shops with typical Arizona schwag (t-shirts, mugs, etc.).  They also had books for people who forgot to bring their own.\n\nWe were delayed for 5 hours due to weather on the East Coast which sucked, but wasn't their fault.  They fed us snacks for free and kept us updated every 15-30 minutes or so.  \n\nAnyway, this isn't one of those airports with armrests on their chairs so it was easy, albeit uncomfortable, to take a nap.  Travel well, my friends! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  3 1/2 star rating?! How much crack are you people smoking!? I will give you three (3) reasons this place sucks balls:\n\n-The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because, they certainly are not outlets. Three separate attempts in different walls (including a charge station proved fruitless. Sonofabitch!).\n\n-Your courtesy people transporters make the most annoying, continuous whirling beep. Jesus Christ why?! Its obnoxious, but it fits your airport well I guess.\n\n-Your employees are lifeless. I go in to get a protein bar, and the woman made 0% eye contact with me the entire time. When she said \""have a great day\"", she must have been talking to the magazine rack.\n\nYou get two stars, go sit in think time and figure out how to call and hire an electrician who can re-wire your outlets. ALL YOUR OUTLETS...LOL.\n\nGo sit in a corner somewhere and figure out how to properly run simple, basic crap. Like the people transporters...Get them to stop whirling like the Pope and Gandhi commandeered these vehicles, began grinding, and then left the alarm on demanding everyone watch them grind....\n\nAnd finally, sit in a corner and figure out how to stop hiring vegetables. Look for people who can have the potential to smirk at me. Just a smirk. I am asking....for just a smirk. I am not that ugly...I think.\n\nCharlotte....silly Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mozart Management - Georgian on Ellsworth - AWFUL BUILDING\n\nI have maintained video proof of all my miserable experiences living in my unit on the first floor for almost three months so far, and have provided proof of a couple of them here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8llYlRPz2Qm7ovPQWSlyA\n\nThis is the NOISIEST place I've ever lived, and I read ALL bad reviews posted about them previously, and what every single person before me wrote is completely and 100% accurate.  \n\nMozart Management rented me and apartment on the ground floor directly across from the Maintenance Room/Office.  I had no disclosure of this whatsoever when I signed my lease.  There is no sign on the door, no evidence that this is where I would be renting a unit, or I'd have never signed a lease for this.  \n\nYou will hear every single floor board in this building, whether it's above or beneath you.  The maintenance crew is helpful, they are NOISY and completely awful to live by.  Due to my location in the building, I hear them all day long, every single day, clearly from my unit because there is a lack of insulation.  \n\nThey are often heckling and telling personal stories down the hall to one another, and I almost feel like I know more about their personal lives than I do of my own.  I don't even understand how they have the time for this.  The phone in the office rings all day long (also sounds like it's coming from my apartment, that's how loud it is) and I also get to hear every conversation made through walkie-talkies.  Every single day I hear the same man coughing and blowing his nose in the office as if he were sitting on my sofa doing it.  It's absolutely disgusting, and you get no peace whatsoever.\n\nAlso, my apartment unit sounds like a construction unit on any given day.  On the other side of the hallways, something else I was never informed of, is some sort of tool room.  I often hear saws, drills, vaccuums, you name it.  All day long.\n\nMozart has made an effort to calm the crew down for inappropriate content, but it's still not enough for my unfortunate apartment location.  My family and I did our research about this matter and it really is up to a rental company to first and foremost to provide a tenant with a peaceful and safe environment.  I never feel at peace here, and as a single female living solo, I am feeling less and less safe as I've become aware of having to share such close quarters with older men every single day that I do not know.  We asked kindly to be released from this lease, but Mozart feels they should be compensated from ME, even though they were creeps about disclosing the truth about this apartment.  Now, I am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost. \n\n\nI REALLY wanted to like Mozart despite all of the bad reviews.  I'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review.  But what the other renters have said IS true; Mozart's SOLE concern is about money, not the comfort or satisfaction of their customers.  They are untrustworthy, know they are untrustworthy, and are completely comfortable with being unethical.\n\nFor the amount of rent paid here (I pay $860 a month for a 1-bed), I've learned you can find a similar, possibly even lower deal, right around the same area in a much more peaceful building. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really great food here! Always quick, clean and helpful! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went here when I dropped my iPhone (tragedy...) and broke the speaker. I could hear my callers, but they couldn't hear me. I went in to Best Buy to see if I could just buy one of those cheap pay-as-you-go phones, because I had some urgent business calls to make, and had planned to be running around town all day. I looked around with a customer service rep, who was in fact friendly. But after some wasted time, we came to the conclusion that they had nothing to offer me.  In short, I have no problem with the customer service at this location. But I wish such a big chain would not forget to supply their stores with the simple/affordable options. This could be my old fashioned preference, but if I want to by a non-color screen flip phone, I'd hope I could find it at one of the biggest electronic stores in the nation. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is a dream come true. From the pans, to the candy molds, the cake toppers and the pre-made icings, it's pure sugary-heaven. I thought I would be able to just walk-in/walk-out, but instead, I spent an hour walking up and down the aisles, determined to check everything out. \nI absolutely adore this store, and will be making another trip VERY soon! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Absolutely the worst customer service of any retail store I've ever experienced. No matter what city/state, it never fails. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business.  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that. My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday. When it was delivered it looked beautiful.  However once opened not so much.  Inside it was filled with....Dollar General brand goods. When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect. If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip. So moral of the tale. If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go. To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to love Bob Evans.  Not sure if I've changed or they have, but I have to say I was not impressed this morning.\n\nThe sausage is still good, but everything else tasted like crap.  You mileage may vary. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place!!! Up close and personal to see your favorite bands. Have been impressed with the sound guys there, always have done a great job!\n\nMy favorite band to see there is Cold Shott and the Hurricane Horns! Always a great time!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Visiting home after a long time away. Great to see this place in the neighborhood. Great bartender and owner. I'll be back next time I visit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years now and it's become my favorite restaurant. This location, however, is my least favorite. I went in for dinner one night and had Michelle C as a server and it just seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be there that night. I'll take my business elsewhere thank you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average. BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces). Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Flew out to Phoenix for a company kickoff.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-pretty friendly staff at security\n-well-organized monitors for departures/arrivals and for baggage claim\n-free WI-FI, woohoo!\n-Cinnabon, TCBY, and Fox Sports Grill next to eachother; perfect grub for my 2 hrs in the terminal\n-great flora and cacti, always makes me think of this old-school Nickelodeon show:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6TFo5GukGk\n\nWhy no fifth star:\n-bit of a lengthy and confusing drive to drop off folks in DEPARTURES\n-watch out for the north,south, & east directions <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to Cosmos once for lunch, and the Cajun chicken panini wasn't bad. I went back again for half off appetizers, and was horribly disappointed. We got the crab dip, which has no discernible pieces of crab meat and tasted as if the whole dip (including meat) had been pureed. We also got the stuffed mushrooms, which arrived shriveled and left too much to be desired. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i don't shop retail unless it's dire, so i have don't my share of digging at thrift stores... and i give props to the good ones.\nthis particular goodwill is RIGHT by my house, so i have stopped in on several occasions.  i have found a few good things here, but on the whole have been disappointed by the selection.  it's pretty disorganized and the selection is very... tired?  yeah, tired.  \ni get that thrift stores sell used stuff.  i do.  i get that.  but this stuff all seemed like it might be on its third or fourth go-round on the thrift store racks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A couple people told me that I would not like this place, but I did!  I liked it a lot actually.  I was smitten by the decor- super modern and clean and done right.  You know when people make their spaces look so modern it ends up just looking cheap... this place is not it.  The front door was a bit scary, if you don't watch your kids or immature friend or family members closely, it is possible that they could sever their body in half vertically.\n\nAnyhow, I had the chicken roll ups, they were good.  The food is like food you can fix at home if you put some effort in it ( this means more than using the microwave or picking up take out and putting it on a plate).  The pita chips were very tasty too.  We got some of those.  The salads look big and green and healthy- the way a salad should look.\n\nI plan to go back and I plan to get something different to try.  Neat concept, this Zoes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Consistently good sushi, and great happy hour specials. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Their service is horrible which is a surprise because nobody its hardly in there. I visit a VS store 2-3 times a month.  I came into this site it was bout really packed I needed help and was ignored the whole time. Someone came in I heard the \""Welcome to Victoria Secret,  can i help you find anything\"" it kinda felt like a slap in my face. When I was paying for my stuff the woman asked if anyone helped me.  I had explained to her that everyone ignored me when I seeked help m the service was horrible. All she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation. I ended up leaving the stuff I was going to buy because I was so disgusted. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Finally - a Pittsburgh restaurant with a decent outside patio!  Patio is in the back, so you don't get all the road noise, and is quite pleasant.  In fact, we got seated in the back corner by the fountain, which is not a normal table, but one of those stone garden tables.  Despite not being the most comfortable of seats, it was by far the most enchanting part of the patio.\n\nI thought the pizza was \""eh.\"" The dough was a little \""doughy' for my taste.  I was significantly more impressed with my pasta dish, which was incredibly delicious, but also incredibly rich, so I had to leave about half of it.  I guess that's what I get for ordering pastas with cream sauce.\n\nIn summary - a cute place for a date if you can sit outside.  I didn't find the inside half as exciting.  I'll give them another chance on the pizza, but even if you don't have that, try the pasta. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm trying to think of a superlative I could possibly use here, and the only thing I could come up with is \""exceptionally mediocre.\""  The Good Egg isn't doing anything exceptionally wrong, but they're doing exactly nothing right.\n\nThe food is bland and unhealthy. The price is cheap but not a bargain. The service is mediocre to poor. The interior looks like it hasn't been deep cleaned in a decade or two.\n\nI guess all the innovative, intriguing food options in Phoenix has me feeling entitled to excellence. Mediocrity just isn't cutting it for me anymore, and this place is the epitome of mediocre.\n\nEdit: Went through the reviews and there are a whole lot of very similar, very suspicious looking four-star reviews, and a couple of obvious 5-star reviews coming from employees. Seems suspiciously like something a failing business would do to manipulate their Yelp rating upwards. Pathetic, so I'm bumping this from a generous 2-stars to a well-deserved 1. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been to every Espresso Royale in Urbana-Champaign and have been a customer since 2010. However, this specific location continuously provides the poorest service. \n\nThe staff is very rude, and much of my complaint rests with them. I can handle unfriendliness, but paying for a large cup of hot coffee and getting something that's colder than room temp is more than I can take. I told a woman at the counter of this error and instead of offering to make another that was at least warm, she pointed to a microwave and told me to heat it up. This happened at a time when I was the last customer in line, and no one else came in afterwards.\n\nAnyways, I still recommend Espresso Royale, just not the one on 6th & Daniel. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't know if coming early would help any... but when we got there at 8pm, the place was hoppin'. There were people seated from as close to the kitchen and all the way up the stairs by the sidewalk. There were hopefuls milling about a bit to get down and place their name for a seating. When we were able to reach the desk, the wait time was 50 minutes.\n\nWe went to Mercurio's for a while, took a stroll around Walnut, and eventually sat down by some very convenient benches nearby. After what we thought was 'adequate' wait time, we peered a bit over the fence and down towards the man (who we think may have been the owner). After a bit, he nodded at us, and started moving a couple of tables around inside. We took that as a signal, meaning, \""Come on down. I'm wrestling these tables apart for you.\""\n\nWe ordered the carne special (steak with alfredo for $30) and the torcia ($15). I wouldn't say that they were the best that i'd ever had, but they were pretty good. The vegetables are fresh; the pasta was just right and sauced/souped enough to my liking. The service, provided mostly by Diane, was excellent. She was friendly and attentive, despite the throngs of customers. The crowds are loud, the atmosphere very.. cozy.. and the walkways very narrow, and, yet, the food and drinks keep coming, accident-free. It seems like it could be highly stressful for the servers, but Diane was smiling every time she came back. Awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst customer service ever. I had an issue with a rental of chairs and tables and the cashier was rude, disrespectfull and unhelpfull. The tables were dirty and breaking apart the chairs were filthy. I agree with the previous comment that the pinatas are nice and sturdy but thats about it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pro:  value, charm, quality, independent\n\nCon:  haven't found one yet....\n\nSleeper alert.  Great breakfast, well-priced served with a smile. Ditto for dinner. Simple, relatively healthy comfort food.   Good Euro feel to it but not overkill.  Nice change of pace from the generic chains.  \nWell worth a try for a quiet couples dinner or breakfast with the kids--they can draw, play hangman etc on the butcher paper table top.  Comp. rolls to start and dessert to finish with breakfast.  Nice touch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This has been my dry cleaner of choice for the last two years!  The service is great!  \nYou're usually greeted within seconds of walking in.  Your clothes are counted, you pay and your ticket is printed within minutes!  The employees are always very friendly and  pay close attention if you have any special instructions regarding your garments.  The price, $2.25/item for dry cleaning, is very reasonable!  One can often times find coupons for $1.99/item which was my initial motivator for trying out this cleaner.  \n\nThey also offer same day dry cleaning service at no additional price.  Drop off your items before 9:00 AM and pick them up by 4:00PM!  Great for those in a hurry!  \n\nCash is preferred but they will take debit cards for a $0.50 fee. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yaki Tacos were yucky! Skimpy on the teryaki and dry. The fries were hard and cold. Place is going down hill fast. I wont eat here again! WOOF!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really wanted to love this place, I really did. But it just wasn't meant to be. From entering to leaving it just was not a good experience. \n\nThe service was absolutely terrible. When we arrived we were not greeted, and it took quite a few minutes before anyone showed themselves to seat us. Once we put in our order it took 30 minutes to be served. In that time we saw people come in and be seated not by the staff, but by people waiting to pick up to go orders. This is simply unacceptable. \n\nThe food is just okay. The flavor mostly comes from the sauces they use, not from the actual food.  So they can use the same protein sources in multiple dishes and just put a new sauce on it. The drinks however are pretty delish, but clearly not a reason to go out of your way or put up with terrible service. \n\nThere are better choices for vegetarian food in the valley, and I would highly recommend going to one of them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My dog means the world to me and I couldn't imagine anyone better to handle her care than Dr. Dorn. I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. \n\nMy first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment, plus medicine, plus taking out her stitches (for free) was $45. I was in shock! It was very reasonable.\n\nNo matter where you live in the city, I highly recommend Dr. Dorn! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stupid bitches made me miss my damn flight and I had to wait 3 hours for the next. Here's what happened.\n\n1) Take a flight out of Chicago and get to Phoenix at 7am, next flight leaves at 7:30 so the gate closes at 7:20 and people on the plane act like grabbing your shit and getting off is rocket science, so I have to wait 10 minutes\n\n2) Proceed to change gate TWICE within' that 20 minute window, and make sure they're on the opposite sides of the airport\n\n3) Get to gate as they're closing the gate.\n\n4) Bitchy US Airways attendant told me she couldn't let me on cause she gave my seat to someone on standby and told me she made last call for boarding, so I told her my plane didn't land until 7 in which she replied \""oh\""\n\n5) Same Bitchy ass US Airways broad working the front desk telling me I'm on an awards ticket so for the next flight so she has to see if I'm even \""eligible\"" to get on it. Prints my new ticket and tells me it's in 3 hours.\n\n6) Change the gate on my NEW ticket AGAIN...TWICE! (I learned my lesson previously so good thing I checked in)\n\n7) Ate a nasty ass salad for $8.99 and a $3 water, and waited for 3 hours.\n\n8) Got on next flight and left.\n\nFuck you, Phoenix International piece of shit. Never again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at The Royal Pams and we are huge fans. The grounds are beautiful and the employees are super friendly! I only gave this 4 stars because although the pool was gorgeous, it was really crowded and not nearly enough seating for all the guests. But, we still had a great time and the staff at the pool bar is exceptional. They are very accommodating and even come around to fill up every ones waters so you never have to go to the bar and ask for one. \n\nT Cooks was really good, more impressed with the breakfast than the dinner but dinner was still really good so I highly suggest making some time to dine there. \n\nThe room was really nice, pretty standard size room but great bathroom and comfortable bed. \n\nI think that this hotel is in a great location - 2 miles from downtown Scottsdale, a few miles from Camelback and only a 2 hour drive to Sedona. I highly recommend this hotel for a long weekend/romantic getaway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After remembering seeing the Dor-Stop on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, we stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning at around 10AM.  Beating the brunch rush was great.  We had a short wait but were seated quickly.  Service was friendly, if a bit rushed.  My omelette was tasty, as were the accompanying home fries.  Everything was fresh and well-prepared.  I would return, and it's the kind of local joint I'll look forward to bringing out-of-town guests to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food isn't great.  I really only like the chocolate cake which is strangely sweet but does not have much chocolate flavor.  (Still I'm strangely addicted to it).  The food is rather bland, the main flavoring ingredient seems to be salt and oregano and that's about it. <|endoftext|>

After being told that the cab will arrive in 10 to 20 minutes I kept waiting for 50 minutes before I was told to find alternate means of transport if I wanted to catch a flight  \n\nMy recommendation is to dump this company and find other cab service companies. \n\nGood bye, Yellow Cab. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My bosses used to drag me here for business get-togethers and meetings.\n\nI know it's hard to imagine hating a place where someone else has picked up the tab. But consistently, once the waiters figure out who's paying, if it's not you, forget it.\n\nBut I guess what the Aquavina staff can't figure out is, if they treat you badly when you're not paying, you won't return when it's your turn to pick up the tab. And I've had such consistently mediocre to bad service here, that will never happen.\n\nI once waited an hour for a drink and chips that never came, surrounded by a dozen people eating and drinking. What a lovely time. \n\nThat same night, asking the \""greeter\"" at the door to help find my party drew nothing but a blank stare, and I had to wander the place looking for them.\n\nIt's not always THAT bad, but it's never met expectations.\n\nFor the record: I've had lunch and attended social get-togethers there. It's been about two years since I've been there. The very last time I went, service was tolerable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food was ok. Fried rice excellent. However, service was terrible. Each of our four person party's entrees was delivered 5-10 minutes apart. By the time my son's meal arrived, my mother-in-law had been politely staring at her soup for 20 minutes. Also, staff was rude. Don't recommend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stop here every time I am in the Strip.  Authentic Greek grocery.  Do not pass up their stuffed grape leaves or the freshly made Babaganous & hummus.  They have great cheeses and a variety of dried lentils and spices.  You will find something delicious here, I promise you that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Half Price Books is way over rated.  (1)  Has a lot of old, mangled paperbacks, mostly romance, (2)  Current and best sellers are meager, probably picked over by the staff, (3)  Bring in a current or best seller to sell and if you get a penny on the dollar, you're lucky.  You would be better served to donate your books to Good Will and taking the tax deduction.\n\n I used to go to this store a lot, but when they opened their Camelback location, it sure seems the way they financed it was to rip you off on the amount offered to buy your books and the quality of books in-store went way down hill.\n\nMy father-in-law had run in to the same problems, he being also a prolific reader, and he has quit going to Half Price Books. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  \""I will go back to Taylor's the next time I feel like having someone hit me in the face with an orange while I hand them $5\"" was my facebook status update right after I ate at Taylor's on Valentine's Day morning. The girlfriend and I had been planning to go to Over Easy that morning but by the time we got out of bed the line was immense. So we drove to IHOP...which was packed. I grabbed my phone and Yelp (oh dear me) told me Taylor's was a good place for brunch.\n\nWalked in and the place was pretty much empty (it's kinda sad when IHOP is fuller than you are but that may just be a sign of the economy). The inside was nice, full of well-dressed people happily eating breakfast so the girlfriend and I snagged a couple menus and sat down. As it was a Sunday morning and I hadn't had any coffee yet I wasn't paying much attention to the menu. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet, some hash browns, bacon, and coffee; the girlfriend ordered some pancakes and OJ. The coffee came (GIANT mugs which I really like) and the waiter seemed pretty cool. I was thinking all was right with the world and then.....the food came...\n\nThe omelet was not so much cooked, mostly spinach, and severely lacking on the goat cheese. The hash browns were those typical of any diner in America, except greasier and cold. The bacon? Paper-thin and miniscule. My GF's food was equally unimpressive and then...the bill came...\n\nIt was like $46 for the 2 of us!! I knew the bacon would be extra but has browns? For like $4? Really?!? $5 for OJ? It was good but, like I said before, seeing it on the bill was a bit like being gobsmacked with an orange while handing over a fiver. Should've just waited in the huge line at Over Easy <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Du Nails is a busy little shop in an easily accessible plaza.  The parking is adequate, and the location is good.  It's in the same plaza as Pei Wei, Sauce, and Safeway, so it is easy to run errands while waiting for your appointment... or to get your nails done before picking up carryout.\n\nThe shop has the ambiance of a garage. There is no attempt to decorate or provide comfort.  This is a place to get the job done as fast as possible, so don't expect to come out feeling relaxed or better about anything except being able to check another errand off your list.\n\nThe technicians do an adequate and totally impersonal job at applying and polishing acrylic nails.  They have Spa chairs for pedicures.  Their pedicures are better than the nail services, but the garagelike atmosphere really detracts from the experience.\n\nThe thing that struck me here is that they are geared to provide one kind of service.  They are good at applying a tip and covering it with acrylic.  If you want tips applied for a special event, or are happy with polish instead of a pink and white look, and do not need a lot of atmosphere, i would recommend them. They do not backfill well, and they do not want any client who requires more than their regularly allotted time to do nails.\n\nThe only person in the shop who does sculpts without tips is the owner, Du.... and he seems to prefer not maintaining clients.  I have sculpts instead of tips, and he did not want to do my nails after a couple of weeks because \""it took too long.\""  I have 2 friends who tried his shop.  The first time they went to him.  When they returned to have their nails filled, he had another tech do the job and they were less than happy with the work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I spoke with Veronica the general manager. She apologized profusely for the mix up and assured me that she spoke with the staff. Ultimately, there was confusion about who was responsible for our table. She indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice.\n\nShe invited me back to the restaurant. Based in her response, I will give them another try and hopefully add more stars. I was so disappointed because I was hungry and really wanted to try the seafood omelette. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's a nice small and authentic market that's just one block off the main strip. I absolutely love this place! If you come at the right time, you'll be able to see the fresh ravioli being made right in front of you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This guy has a lot of good vehicles cheaper than most dealers and private parties however my experience with him was TERRIBLE. I live up north in Cave Creek and he had a car I really liked so I called him to setup an appointment to see it and test drive it. He was VERY reluctant to let me test drive it and VERY demanding of immediate cash (he repeated this to me about 5 times). Anyway I managed to convince him to let me test drive the car without actually handing him a large sum of cash. So I venture down 30+ minutes in Phoenix traffic and am able to look at the car but when I go to ask to test drive it.. NO! Again he was going on and on about having cash in hand up front before i can even drive the car. Now i respect why he is doing that.. however.. who on EARTH wants to pay for something without testing/using it? Maybe it's me.. but I see a vehicle, especially one that I'm going to pay $6,000 or more on an investment.\n\nSo if you are the type who loves just randomly giving money away for something without using it or verifying it suits your needs.. feel free to give this guy a call.. he has plenty of good deals.. but if your like me and want to ensure you know what your getting.. look elsewhere. <|endoftext|>

The garden in the spring was absolutely beautiful. Displaying desert plants from the Sonoran Desert in the Southwestern United States and around the world.  Many of the plants in bloom at the time that I went.  Although it was spring and the temperature was tolerable I can't imagine taking a stroll through the gardens during the sweltering summer days.  There isn't too much shade along the paths.  \n\nThe employees were really friendly and very informative.  I also really appreciated the fact that the gardens were so well maintained.  Parking is free.  Adult tickets are $22 and Students $12.  Unfortunately, I believe the Chihuly exhibit has ended but don't let that stop you from checking out this beautiful gem.  Would definitely drop by the gardens if I'm ever in the Phoenix area again.  I loved it!  Don't forget to bring your hat, water, and some sunscreen! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everyone was very friendly and accommodated my needs, particularly to return the car to a different  location.  They explained the process very well.  The only issue that I had was that I had forgotten to pick up the direct contact information when I was in the office, and it was hard to get in contact with someone via the main line. This is one of the busiest Enterprise locations, so it helps to have the direct contact information of one of the managers there. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  All I can say is, I really hope this place was having a bad day. I was really hoping this place would be good. I loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go...but I guess not.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order. I walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there. There were two people behind the counter making sandwiches. One left to ring a customer up and came back. All along, for the 5 minutes I was standing there, nobody said \""we'll be right with you\"", \""Hello\"", nothing. I didn't even get eye contact, but I suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something.\n\nI finally got an \""Are you ready?\"", which as a side note I thought was somewhat rude. You can't even give me a \""Hello. How may I help you?\"" Just an \""Are you ready?\"" as if I had been making him wait a long time before making my decision. No... I was waiting on you. But I digress. I ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment wasn't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic.\n\nThe food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread. You can look at my photos to see what I got. I think they speak for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I will keep this short and sweet. I never even met the doctor. The office staff was the rudest experience i have ever had. I have called for the past month trying to get results with no luck. No one returns my calls and the girls on the phone are rude and not friendly at all. The doctor may be good but for me, it's about the whole experience and this was an awful one!!!!! <|endoftext|>

Regency Cleaners is fine for dry cleaning but do not entrust any tailoring or hemming to this place!

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to the newly renamed 9/05 with a group under the recommendation that they did their tofu dishes really well and catered towards vegetarian foods.\n\nI guess the tofu itself was decent; thick, firm and textured, but the curry (which had been vaunted as one of the best dishes) fell completely flat. Where was the spice? Where was the flavor?? Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? To add insult to injury, everyone else at the table who had ordered the Pad Thai and Bangkok Dynamite dishes sniffling and complaining about the spiciness of their food. \""I'm Mexican\"" whispered one lady \""I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes\"". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home. \n\nThe entr\u00e9es started at 10$ and so did the drinks, I was priced out of ordering one of their 15$ \""martinis\"" and stuck with a four dollar beer. The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.\n\nSomeone mentioned that ownership changed hands with the name changing, maybe the good cooks left as well? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best place for pizza & wings, hands down!\n\nIf you're looking for awesome wings and very good pizza, Red Devil is the place to go. I'm not too sure if this is the original Red Devil, but it's very vintage. You gotta try their special that they have which is the 20 wings with a large pizza for like $25 bucks, I believe? Can't get any better than that. Their BBQ sauced wings are amazing on a dish. They're known for their perfect ranch sauce and fresh dinner rolls. I'm not big on hot wings, but my dad devours their hot wings every time we go, so they much be good! \n\nGreat place to go and always great service! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My daughter and I stopped in last night for the first time.  I had the Chicken Chop Suey and she had Sweet & Sour Chicken.  We started with an order of Steamed Dumplings.  The dumplings were great.  They had a lot of meat in them.  The Chop Suey was made with a white sauce.  I am used to it being made with a brown sauce.  That did not matter as it was delicious.  The S&S Chicken was wonderful as well.  The S&S sauce that came with it was not laden with all that bright red food coloring.  Very tasty.   She also got an Egg Roll.  It was huge!  We had to split it.  Niiice.  And, even though you order and pick your food up at a counter, the service was great.  I ordered a Chicken Lo Main to go for my son and she asked me if I wanted them to wait a bit before they cooked it.  I like that!  That tells me that they care about our experience after I pay them!!  A plus!  We've passed this place up numerous times.  Not any more.  We'll be back! <|endoftext|>

My eyes are a weird shape and I always had difficulty finding contact lenses, but he was able to determine the perfect brand.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My mom and I got a manicure and pedicure here.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her experience with Shannen.\n\nI did not enjoy my experience with Janien. To start she shaved the little hairs on my feet with a razor that was not in the disinfecting liquid and then replaced the cap and did not put it in disinfecting liquid. Do you realize how many disease you can spread like that? Then she didn't put my flip flops on before putting on my polish and wanted me to walk barefoot from the pedicure station to the other side of the salon to the manicure station. Luckily I was saved from this disgusting venture by another stylist who offered me some salon flip flops to put on. Which hey why didn't you put those on before hand??\n\nThey use aceton nail polish remover and don't have non-acetone which was annoying but not really her fault. Finally my biggest annoyance was that she layered - globbed really- the nail polish on. So even thirty minutes later (waiting for my mom to finish) my nail polish was still wet. And at no point was I placed under a light or fan or anything for them to dry. So I get home and three nails have little marks and dings and one nail is ruined. That's HORRIBLY annoying when I just paid 60 bucks for both. \n\nPS Cash only <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr, who I assume is the owner. He finally came to our table and after I explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldn't have any customers then he walked away. He did nothing to compensate us for the long wait. I go here because it is convenient for everyone. The food is just so so. Well this will be my last visit. I understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better. Ritters gets a Failing Grade in this category and an OK for the food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I recently came here for a safety recall having to do with the cruise control of my 2002 Ford Explorer. I had sent an online request for an appointment Tuesday for the recall service (free) and to get \""THE WORKS? FUEL SAVER PACKAGE $39.95 OR LESS\"" which includes free tire rotation. Two days later, I called them after receiving no response. They said that they were having trouble with their e-mail system and to come in on Friday, which I did, arriving around 7:15 in the morning. That, along with tire rotation and oil change, had me ready about 8:45 or so. Unfortunately, the first time, they had charged me for the recall service, which I had to have them correct since per Ford, this should be no charge to me. Because I was in a hurry, I failed to get them to also remove the charge for the tire rotation which was supposed to have been included for free as part of my package. I feel this service department is dishonest and intentionally attempts to avoid honoring their advertised discounts. Very sorry I came here and will not purchase a new car from them in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I thought this Fry's closed a little later on a Friday night - either 11pm or midnight.\n\nNope. 10pm. I got there, knowing what I wanted and needed. My friend also got what she wanted as well...no announcements that the store was closing. My friend and I were at the self-checkout...for the record, I hate those things because I feel like they're taking away from the workforce, but that's just me, though.\n\nAnyway, the lone cashier that was open looked like she had a huge line, so I opted to use the self-checkout.\n\nI got my stuff and my friend started to ring up her purchases...*machine stops working*\n\n\""Oh, were you going to buy that? I thought you were both done. I turned off the registers.\"" and continued to make a fuss about what a pain it was to turn them back on. Really? Turn the key to the right. That's all she has to do...unless she needs to call in a manager or something. I don't know about their procedures to re-open registers.\n\nI kept thinking, \""No, she's just going to walk out with it.\""\n\nInstead my friend said, \""Well, since it's clearly so much hassle for you to turn the registers on, then I'll take my business elsewhere. There are other stores that are open.\""\n\n\""Oh no, it's not that...let me turn on the registers again.\"" \n\nSomehow she made it sound like she was doing us the favor...and she turned a key and entered in a code and VOILA! the register was open again...all that attitude from the person monitoring the self-checkout just to have her turn a key and enter a code? Lame.\n\nAt the end, when she realized that it wasn't a $2.00 purchase, she was all smiles.\n\nLong story short: go before closing, preferably before the sun sets because it's a little scary...and the parking lot is a little on the dirty side, as was the rest of the store. I saw where some people had munched on donuts, then tossed them into a shelf, hiding it behind some items, hoping it wouldn't be spotted. GROSS. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Welcome to Houston's with a happy Hillstone hat on! One thing that always bothered me about the former Houston's was how dark and dreary it could be, but that is definitely not the case with Hillstone. I absolutely love the architecture, location and openness of this building. It's fresh and airy with plenty of large windows, an open patio, and rock finishing. The restaurant seating isn't cramped and you've got plenty of room to relax and enjoy the meal with those you came with and not 20 other strangers. \n\nBefore I got to Hillstone, I read up on the yelp reviews and noticed Kat S's note about the ice cubes. So, when I sat down and ordered my Diet Coke, the first thing I glanced at were the ice cubes and Kat's right! They are old fashioned and pretty great! They are the type of ice cubes they place in whiskey to make sure they don't crush when they are dropped in, but I also think they make the soda pour without fizzing up. \n\nSo now I will move on to the meal. The reviews are right in saying that this is exactly like the Houston's menu but with a nice improvement. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with the couscous. Warning: the sandwich is huge and way too big for one lunch, but that could be a good thing if you want to have the other half for lunch. We didn't have dessert but I glanced at the menu and while they have several of the Houston's signatures, I think they should add apple crisp to the list. \n\nI will definitely be back to Hillstone and think this is a nice addition to the area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place so much...  It's my favorite bar in town.\n\nThe grilled cheese and fried broccoli is where it's AT, and the drinks are inexpensive.  It can be quiet enough to have lots of talking with friends, loud enough to chill by yourself and have some food.\n\nOne drawback is it's hard to find seating on weekends, but with two rooms and two bars, it just takes a bit of time but not too long, and that happens with any bar in downtown on the weekend. <|endoftext|>

With a great selection of food and drinks (including alcohol and alcoholic coffee drinks), it's too good to pass up.\n\nI do have to ding them slightly, though, for being a tad on the dark side, plus the seating isn't super-comfy.  But depending on your mood or style, you might well prefer Kopi over the other also-great alternatives on the same block. <|endoftext|>

This place deserves GREAT REVIEWS!\nI am personally moved to write this review because I am passionate about telling the TRUTH:  This restaurant \""Pizza Heaven\"" was given the perfect name for it's contribution.  Not only do they serve the Best pizza with crust that has the \""crispy chewy-ness\"" that one can only Dream of, but there is a most delightful, amiable young entertainer and he plays a whole cache of great songs through many decades of music mostly by heart.  Erick Hasbun is ALWAYS sweet and considerate and loves to do any request that can be satisfied to the gamut of customers.  Come to \""Pizza Heaven\"" if you Truly intend to be delighted by their tranquil atmosphere, their evident loving passion for their craft, and for the BEST pizza that you can have outside of Italy!  Have a good time and bring no less than joy to this beautiful place!  (I am a vegan, and for all vegetarians/vegans out there, please note that they also have the most \""cheese-like\"" cheese I have had since I had my last real cheese pizza!)\n\nWarm Regards,\nChristof Catlin <|endoftext|>

I had the seniorita-no-meata which seemed like the smaller, wrap version of a meatless chipotle burrito. I went with a side of the miso soup which fresh and deliciously homemade. They're more than willing to make any wrap veggie-friendly which is always a plus for me! And for the religious tea-drinkers out there, I would highly recommend giving the lemon aid a chance, it's my new favorite! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ate in tonight and the food was fine it was the service that was not good.  Our waiter was very Rico suave and had far better things to do with his night than bring us our food or even show up to our table at all, when he did make it around,  he reeked of Cologne and I just wanted him to scram.  There was a large group of odd looking hygienically challenged old Indian men running around,  I think they were the bus boys but they came by to clean a table next to us and liberally spayed Windex all over the place so that added a nice flavor to our food and he then decided the carpet on the front part of our table needed vacuuming right then and there so he broke out the vacuum and went to town for about five Min's, nice. we had to seek out the check and when we did get it we were over charged for alcohol we didn't even order, thanks Rico for the nice $71 evening for our little party of three, as good as the tikka masala is we wont be back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was excited to try for the Friday Night Fish Fry after watching the yelp reviews. Pulled up at 6:30 and a line so it must be the real deal.  Gave my name to the hostess and told maybe a 15 minute wait which was perfect as my son and his friend would not arrive till then. 45 minutes passed and I checked with the hostess as I am noticing a few groups being seated who arrived after me. This time the hostess was not the young girl who took my reservation but an older lady who advised me I had a long wait as I was last on the list and at least 6 groups ahead of me. Some how they must have made a mixup but I would not mind the wait as it must be good. Finally 8:10 pm we are seated and quickly served water and menus. I asked about the fish and was told it was all you can eat Fresh Alaskan Pollack, Cole Slaw and French Fries for $9.95. Alaskan Pollack is not too bad white fish, similar to cod where it's namesake Atlantic Pollack is not the same species and is somewhat a slim white fish with color close to the skin and an off flavor, mostly ground and used in fish sticks and imitation crab. While the fish was cooked nicely and the french fries crisp, the fish was not Alaskan Pollock and had the off taste of its namesake from the Atlantic. Service was scatter brained from the hostess mixup to the server who had the memory of a gnat and took us the last 15 minutes to get our check. Just by the sheer number of guests I think I just hit them on a bad night and maybe their fish provider made a mistake this week. I will head back to the Peoria Cafe for my fish next Friday as it is always good but I can't help myself to try new Friday night fish fry's over the Valley. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My car was overheating and the closest place I could think to take it was this Pep Boys. Let's make a long story short...they quoted me almost $700 because \""all of my hoses needed to be replaced\"" along with my thermostat and a coolant flush. Not to mention they were going to charge me EXTRA for a warranty on the parts which is absolutely ludicrous. After talking to a trusted mechanic (who doesn't live in AZ) I took it for a second opinion to Shadow Mountain Auto Service. It was a bit of a drive but I made it. After all, they're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans. A trusted, hard working, friendly auto business. Not only did they quote me $300 less than Pep Boys but they told me they couldn't find anything wrong with my hoses. It seems to me that Pep Boys DOESN'T do everything for less or even with integrity, for that matter. <|endoftext|>

The flavored coffee is the BEST, one can immediately taste the difference from the brews here and the nauseating Hazelnut that is sold at every other place that sells coffee.  That flavor should be banished from the Earth, but that's another story.\n\nTry the Graham Cracker, Chocolate Orange, Almond Joy or Coconut, delicious!  Nicholas also carries freshly baked biscotti in a variety of flavors as well as other eclectic baked goods. \n\nA must stop for visiting guests and coffee/tea lovers! <|endoftext|>

This time was no exception. \n\nI would describe the place as a upscale sports bar.  The service was great, I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty.\n\nI had the Buffalo chicken wrap with French fries. I would definitely order this again! It was absolutely delicious!!  I also had a spicy bloody mary which was standard, as well as some mimosas.  The mimosas were delicious and came with a mini bottle of champagne in its own little \""ice bucket\"".  Which was just one part of an ice shaker with the mini bottle nestled inside, but it was genius :)\n\nThe happy hour looked nice but was not valid during event nights, which was disappointing.  I will definitely visit again :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After reading all of the rave reviews for Spinato's we decided to give it a try.  We get pizza for Friday dinner often and I was looking for something better and closer to home.  This location is a few blocks off of my normal route, so I put in an online order for two pizzas.  Having had fast food places miss online orders in the past, I gave the shop a call to confirm that the order was received and that it would be ready on-time.  \nWe had other plans for later in the evening so timing was critical.\nAt the scheduled time I arrived at Spinato's expecting to go in, pick-up two pizzas and leave.  \nNo such luck.  One of the 'clerks' in the take-out area started pushing buttons and making odd faces at the register.  Then he called the other clerk over and the both start mashing buttons and making faces at two registers.  Then the short one says, \""I'm sorry, I don't have an order for you, I can make it up in about 10 minutes?\""  Knowing that they normally need 40 minutes to get their pizzas ready, I was looking at undercooked pizza or no pizza.  I opted for the second choice and left.  \n\nKFC for dinner.\n\nA half an hour after I was home and finishing the chicken, someone from Spinato's calls and says \""We have your pizza waiting\"".  I told the young lady that the call was not appreciated and that I was in the store at the scheduled time and they had no order for me.  \n\nThen to add insult to injury, 3 hours after that, I get a text telling me that my order was confirmed.\n\nNot done . . .\n\nMy daughter really wanted to try the pizza and thought that the mistake was a one- time thing and we should still try the pizza.\n\nOK, we'll get pizza for Saturday.  So I run 20 miles each way to pick-up the same order they had lost at one store and picked it up from another location. \n\nYou can get better pizzas from the grocer's freezer.  \n\nThe crust is flat, no edge, looks like it was runout on a sheeter (machine that rolls out dough). \n\nThe sauce is tasteless, and just that, canned tomato sauce.  \n\nThe meats were also bland, who would expect that from a sausage and pepperoni pizza?\n\nPeople, this is not good pizza. . .  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n were <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Alright, I'll admit I've been driving past Red Devil for a decade now and always wondering what it was all about. It was always busy, seemingly always open, and really odd looking enough that it drew my interest. \n\nAfter all these years, I finally decided to try Red Devil only because it was time I actually stopped, and I had a craving for spinach and artichoke dip. Upon walking in, it was obvious this place has been here forever. It's a relic, and it probably hasn't been remodeled since, well... ever. They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers. \n\nThe appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a \""it's low quality but oh so tasty\"" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake. \n\nOverall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas. I felt it to be very reasonable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am hesitant to write this review seeing all the glorious write ups before me. I came for lunch today and was very disappointed. I ordered the tapas trio and 30 minutes later the server came over to tell me they were out of the sauce for the meatballs and the chef did not want to make a substitution. Not a big deal, but 30 minutes was quite a while to wait to be told to order something else. \n\nOn the servers suggestion I ordered the pollo cubano, it came out very, very dry. It was covered in a citrus sauce that was decent, but even with the sauce and marinated onions on top the chicken was barely edible. \nMy friend ordered Arroz con Pollo and the chicken was just as dry, I didn't taste any chorizo and the asparagus was overcooked to a mush.\nThe sangria was pretty good and had a subtle rose taste.. I'd return just for it.\n\nLike I said with so many good reviews perhaps this was just an off day. I'll certainly go back and give them another try, hopefully with an updated review to follow. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been to this restaurant for several other business dinners but this visit was the most unsatisfactory visit.\n\nFresh off a 5 hour flight, we checked into our hotels and went straight to dinner at 8pm. We were famished after our flight.\n\nThe meal started out great. We ordered the LOCAL ANTIPASTO PLATTER with assorted dry cured 100% berkshire meats, olives sweet and salty pickles, and toasted bread. It was delicious!\n\nWe took our time to enjoy the appetizer while chatting. When we finished our appetizers 20 minutes later, we looked around for our waiter expecting our dinners. He immediately came over and apologized that our 2 dinner entree order went in after a large table's order and he was working on getting our orders rushed through. \n\nUnfortunately, our table didn't receive any bread so we had to ask for it to tie us over. He looked perplexed why we didn't get bread but made sure a basket was brought over immediately. Don't know if it was because we were starved but the house bread was yummy with peach butter spread.\n\nIt was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners. He exclaimed that it was an ordeal trying to get our entrees. REALLY?!? Sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected. Hell's kitchen wouldn't stand for it. \n\n- PECAN CRUSTED SNAKE RIVER TROUT: hearty portions/ over blackened\n- PAN ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS: right portion size but toooo salty\n- LOCAL SQUASH & ZUCCHINI WITH SWEET VIDALIA ONIONS: over cooked and mushy.\n\nOur waiter, Adam, was very nice and checked in on our table several times throughout dinner. He apologized several times and we understood it was out of his hands. The restaurant GM should have made an appearance to our table. Lucky we didn't have clients with us this evening. Poor kitchen line management explains another reason why business dinners take 3 hours at these types of restaurants. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\n\nService was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In my early yelping days, I used to believe that a 5 star review for a restaurant, should qualify as a 5 star meal.  As my yelping abilities have matured, however, I have adopted a more holistic method for my reviews.  Ambiance, originality, and service are now major considerations as well.  And albeit a rare occurrence, the service here has earned Hillstone Stewart K.'s coveted 5 stars.\n\nNow don't misunderstand the food here is exquisite.  Hillstone stated that it emphasizes local produce to comprise its dishes.  I am all for this, not for environmental reasons (which I couldn't care less about), but rather practicality.  Local food tastes fresher because it generally is.  The \""Nice\"" salad proved this point as it tasted fresh and \""green\"".  You know that new plant taste that food picked fresh from the field has?  This was especially apparent in the walnuts in the salad which had the imbued flavors of the shell still on it (without the crunchiness of course).  \n\nAh, but here is where Hillstone's, or rather its server Becca, exceptional service points come in.  I was unsure of what entree to get here.  I asked our waitress for her recommendations.  I expected the usual spiel about how the server coincidentally thinks that the most expensive item on the menu is the best tasting.  Not so with Becca, she recommended the $28 ribs or even the burger.  Both are items that are on the cheaper end of Hillstone's offerings.  So despite how quickly, and almost artificially, she seemed to be able to rattle off the recommendations, she quickly gained my trust and passed my test.\n\nBut alas, I had ribs earlier in the day.  I opted for the $35 Hawaiian Ribeye.  It came out cooked perfectly medium rare (red with warm center), but a tad sweeter than I had imagined since it was glazed in something akin to pineapple something or other.  When Becca came by the table and asked, \""How is your meal?\""  I answered exactly as I mentioned above.  I guess my Northeastern bluntness may come across as a bit brash around these parts, but I was being honest and I did say that I enjoyed my meal.  But Becca seemed concerned though, like it was her mission to right some great injustice that Hillstone's chef committed against me.  Again, I assured her the steak was good.  So I rounded off my meal with the brownie in a cream sauce that was good enough to drink but decadent enough to make me sick and a coffee.    \n\nSo throughout my experience here, my waitress thoroughly explained each menu item from the Lux coffee (a local coffee roaster) to practically every entree on the menu, with an patience and positive attitude that I'm frankly just not used to back home.  In addition, at no point did my  water or coffee ever reach empty nor ever leave my table for want of anything...but here was the real gem for the evening.  Despite my fleeting, obtuse comment about the ribeye being \""too sweet\"", she removed it from the bill!  I assured Becca that I was genuinely satisfied with the meal, but she stopped me and replied, \""I want you to be completely satisfied with your experience here.\""  Then she said something to the effect that if I wasn't completely satisfied, I ought not pay. ....NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF SERVICE THAT TRULY DEMONSTRATES GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THE CUSTOMER.  So what I would consider about a 3.5 to 4 star meal, has become a 5 star experience.  If I am in the area in the future, I will return and would hope that this level of dedication to customer satisfaction is adhered to by all at Hillstone. <|endoftext|>

Then he introduces 3 teenage girls from Chandler who are going to warm up the audience....I thought ok..maybe 2 or 3 songs and they will bring Wynonna on.....NOOOOOO!!!! These girls played for almost an hour...it was HORRIBLE!!!!\n\nFinally..9:30 Wynonna came on....once again this place is so small, the audience interrupted her the whole time she was onstage...people walking up to the stage extending their hand, asking her to take a picture with them, yelling out songs for her to sing, yelling out profanitys...It was HORRIBLE!!!!\n\nI will not be back!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Penn Mac is a landmark in Pittsburgh.  I am a comlplete fan, in particular of their cheese section, which in many ways is the world's best.  They beat out the competition because of their excellent prices, selection, and their quality.  I have checked the prices at Whole Foods and Market District, and often times you pay twice as much at those places for the same cheese.  Carol, a.k.a. Dearheart, is a wonderful help, especially if you are there on a day when it's not as over crowded.  Some other great things about the store...bulk spices (very reasonably priced), olive oil, dried fruit, deli meats, and more.  This store is my favorite place in Pittsburgh and you are missing out if you have not visited! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It was either Mother Theresa or the Baha Men who said \""Who let the dogs out?\"" and I must say, I was glad someone let my bacon cheddar dog out of the kitchen and into my stomach.  Dee-licious!\n\nStopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers, dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of \""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"" so this was a while ago.)\n\nAlso, since I was just visiting town, I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!\n\nSo the point is, you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer, and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love coming here for $20 Tuesday deal; you just can't beat it.  I have to say, the salmon Bruschetta is my favorite of all of them.  The bottle deal can't be beat and the selections are nice. Very broad.  They change it every couple months as well, so always trying new wines.  Highly recommend getting a reservation because it's always packed on Tuesdays.  The service is great, though sometimes, if they are having a bad day, they tend to complain about how busy they are.  While I empathize, I'm here to relax and get away from my work troubles. Just be patient with them and they will treat you right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dark, spacious, and neighborhood friendly is how I'd describe Dunnings, a fixture on Braddock Ave for years. \n\nI met my friend Jean here, she is a once a week customer. Lucky her living on Biddle Street, she lunches daily at different eateries on Braddock ave. One day the Square Cafe (read my review), one day the Map Room, another day D's Packs n Dogs. \n\nLooking over the menu, my choices were limited to a veggie wrap or salads. I chose a veggie wrap, sans cheese with a side of apple sauce. The wrap was nothing special, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, tomato, and a side of canned applesauce.\n\nJean had a buffalo chicken wrap and iced tea. She complained the tea was weak, I never noticed. She said he wrap was good, a chicken breast fried, then drenched in buffalo chicken sauce, then drenched in blue cheese dressing and wrapped in a flour tortilla. \n\nDunnings is nothing special, it's a long time establishment that gets by on regulars. This day, the most I saw in the place was 9 people in the bar and dinning room. \n\nService was ok, out waitress seemed to be preoccupied with something or someone in the kitchen and it took forever for her to bring the bill to the table. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Good steak if you don't get out much.  Not nearly as good as the price would lead you to believe.  Ruth's Chris will never be a Morton's or a Gibson's.  While Pittsburgh does not have a Gibson's, you should really go to Morton's.  \n\nThe atmosphere is alright, the drinks moderately stiff, and the salad was great...  But one is supposed to come here for steak. \n\nRegrettably, my last two trips (I wasn't paying... hence why I went back) gave me a piece of beef like my late grandma would cook in her oven's broiler with butter.  For a $50 strip, I would expect it to be more like the hand cut, unfrozed meat I make for my grilling parties.  As such, I would rather fire my grill up in December than give Ruth's Chris more money for mediocrity.\n\nGood Talk. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is amazing!  I'm from the Northeast, so I had no idea there were so many varieties of desert plants.  The cacti, the trees, the flowers...everything was stunning.  I spent hours walking around with my family and could easily have stayed longer, but we had my sister's baby out with us and he was ready for a nap.  Not all the members of the group were as enthusiastic about Botany as I am, but everyone had a great time.\n\nThe Chihuly art display at the entrance is gorgeous.  We also watched a very interesting glass blowing demonstration.  The views of the mountains are breathtaking.  I took over 600 photos during the first visit here alone.  This is a must see attraction for visitors and residents of the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I would love to go when the butterfly exhibit is happening and when the cacti are blooming.\n\nThe trails are not too well marked and a bit confusing, so if you plan to hike (as we did, and it was fabulous), ask for a map when you buy your tickets or download the trail guide from their website.\n\nMy parents are members and they tell me that the Gardens offer lots of fun classes and demonstrations for children and adults.  \n\nThe first time I visited, it was in February, so it was not too hot and we were able to spend the entire day there.  Obviously, in the summer you'd want to visit in the early morning or evening when the heat is less oppressive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Noodles, sushi, sake, and other fare; all done quite well without insulting your fiscal sensibilities.  The restaurant and kitchen are well staffed, service is prompt and courteous, the atmosphere is small, subtle, and somewhat intimate.  I appreciate that they aren't afraid to spice things up - may I suggest the tantan-men?  Overall, a great place for noodle lovers like myself.  From my experience, the attention to the cuisine may suffer just slightly on a busy weekend evening. Try this place on a slower weeknight an it may improve your first impression. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We traveled to Mt. Holly to attend a death in the family. Luckily I knew where the hotel was located or I would have driven right past the entrance. The parking situation is horrible. The parking layout is poorly designed and I spent far too much time waiting on other guests to park or drive past. The lady at reception did not greet us when we walked up to the front desk. I am an IHC Gold Elite member. The usual offer of bottled water was an after thought and she only offered a single bottle for two guests. There was no hair dryer in the room and when I called the front desk the lady responded as though I was lying. After a few minutes later a member of the housekeeping staff came to my room. She did not greet me as i opened the door. She came in and looked around the room as though I didn't think to look around for the hair dryer before calling the front desk. She did, however, return quickly with a hair dryer. Most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude. The breakfast area was incredibly crowded. The morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door. I opened the door and it was lying in the hallway with my personal information there for anyone interested in reading my bill. <|endoftext|>

Like someone stated earlier, I pay a copay every time I go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do.  This is total BS.  I thought I was going to the doctor not a gym.  The Doctors are good there, but it is soooo slow.  If you have a 10am appointment, don't expect to get in before at least 10:30am.\n\nI called and I was told this fee was to offset the cost of the Lab, EMR and Patient Portal cost.  I'm not sure what Lab they are referring to because every time I have blood drawn they send it off to some place called LabCorp.  Isn't this the cost of doing business?  So should I start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use?  I don't think so. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everyone, I'm floating on Employee Cloud Nine. There's a kid named Irving at this Best Buy that should be Employee of Forever. Por Quoi? He's forever changed my opinion of this store. I've had some grumpy thoughts after Geek Squad Purgatory Snafu's. No more! Irving has fixed it all. \n\nThis review is going to read pretty much ala a performance review. (Yeah, my experience was that earth shatteringly amazing.) Concierge service all the way!\n\nThis shorty walked in, looked up and around the colosseum that Best Buy is, unsure of which direction to walk in. I'm so glued to the ground the not all signs are obvious from the door. Mid-step in the wrong direction a smiling face popped up and inquired if he could be of service. \n\nLike a ray of sunshine I met Irving.\nWhen I said yes, he not only walked me briskly to the printer ink area, he made sure to help me locate the proper ink cartridge. \n\nI had brought a picture of my printer. He confirmed with someone/or something in the back on the appropriate ink cartridge to pick up. Together we cheerfully tried to figure out what I really needed. (One Amazon purchase later I realized I was in dire need of an add'l black toner. This is no bueno at 2:31am.) \n\nBrilliantly I had failed to come to the store with critical details. We walked around to the printer aisle and looked at a current model. Irving (artfully) opened the printer and I finally remembered what I needed. (Maybe having a beer at Whole Foods before hand didn't help. Feel free to judge. Even better, try the Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout.)\n\nWith such an easy shopping experience, I said yes to \""Would you like to see anything else in the store?\"". Notoriously difficult to part with her time and money Irene *volunteered* to look at tech stuff. Oh my word. Call the EMTs.\n\nAs I'm whisked into the sales den of anything-near-the-televisions, the other dude greeted Irving like he was his best bud. (Everyone gives Irving love. )\n\nWaiting in line was a very quick process. All the registers were moving briskly. And with the luck of the draw, low and behold, it was a smiling Irving who efficiently processed my check-out.  \n\nBest shopping experience *ever*! Can't believe this kid has only been working for a few months at Best Buy. Valued asset! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  ..my original review was deleted due to violating Yelp's Content Guidelines or Terms of Services.\n\nNot sure how, or why. I think you all should know how bad the food was here, and how dirty the establishment was inside before you waste the trip. I also made a point to note that being of a specific ethnic origin does not automatically grant you a superior palate which can taste food from that origin better than the next person.\n\nBottom line: The kitchen was a disgusting wreck when I was able to peek back in there. The food gave me food poisoning, and was hands down the worst I've had. It is hard for me to respect a business who doesn't respect their customers enough to sweep the floor- <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been here before, 1st time for my friend and we had a Deal Chicken coupon.\n\nWe arrived early for the sunset and were not dissappointed as the view is amazing.  We had drinks at the bar while we waited for our reservation and the sunset which we went outside on the balcony to watch for a few mintues.  The bar staff was attentive and nice quick with an offer for another drink and refills on the water. \n\nOur reservation time came and we were escorted to a window table in the dinning room, small, cozy and intimate.   Our three course meal was delicious! The complimentary bread was warm and the butter soft!  Perfect.   We had the carprese salad, seafood bruchette and the flat iron steak served with potatoes and green beans.   Our steaks were cooked perfectly and everything else was just as good.\n\nOur waiter, (forgot his name) was a native Arizonan and we had a nice chat with him.\n\nI highly recommend The Wrigley, but only if you have the money as it is expensive but with the coupon, it certainly was a great deal! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place (several hundred dollars worth). He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not for the location but Sprint over all.  HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!  Lots of dropped calls and just plain bad reception.  And this is in the heart of the city too.  Central Corridor.  I wish I could change! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you never trusted a review today I share my opinion of my disappointing visit,well today I must say this place DIDN'T do right be me. I feel if your paying 79.00 for detail. Detail it,  you spent more energy selling me the sh#*,then detail the sh#* out if it. they have enough men there. Why so sloppy. I swear my lazy azz could have done better. I took it back pointed out the obvious,still no satisfaction. Don't waste your time here for a detail. This place dont know the  meaning of that word. Get your wash and move on. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Judging by some of these reviews, I believe that anything four or five stars was done by someone who went from domino's to this.\n\nI've been to this place several times... it's family owned, it's clean, but pizza heaven it is not.\n\nTheir pizza is good and nothing more.  I liked it, but it wasn't out of this world, I had the Pizza Bianca and it does not deserve 5 stars. It's OK. that's it.\n\nI really don't understand how places like this on yelp get such high reviews, but I have a theory:\n\nPeople who do not venture out beyond their safe zone develop a relative reality.\n\nLet's just say this about Pizza Heaven:\nThere wasn't anything bad about the place.  They have music sometimes, but it's a duo fronted by the owner's son.  They're so-so, just like the pizza, no wrong notes, but I won't be buying their album soon.\n\nI wouldn't come here unless I was invited by someone, in which I would still come, but I can think of 20 pizza places that are better than this and many of those 20 are cheaper. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I agree with the 1 star here. It seems every time I'm in here I catch these guys when they have had a bad day. I'm in alot of businesses during the day and this has to be my least favorite one to go to. Not because of the product but the customer experience! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> great place for lunch.  Good food and fresh.  Love the chicken souvalki....:) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow! I cannot thank Anne Gregory enough for their help in finding my dream wedding dress. I am from Pittsburgh but currently live in NYC so I went all over NYC looking for the perfect wedding gown. When I couldn't find anything I was super frustrated. I don't think I am a picky person or hard to please so I couldn't understand why wasn't able to find 'the dress'. I was home in Pittsburgh with my mom doing some wedding planning this past week and was frantically trying to find 'the dress'. We came across Anne Gregory online and quickly made an appointment. After speaking with them on the phone I was convinced this would be the place and promptly canceled another appointment so that I could schedule one with Anne Gregory instead. And I am so thankful that I did because the first dress I tried on with them was the one I ended up purchasing. It had just been delivered by UPS minutes before I arrived in the shop and I was the first person to try it on. Greg and Mary Anne were working with my mom and I and they were perfect! Very friendly and helpful. Greg read me like a book and knew instantly what would look good on me. The dress I chose is so completely different from all the others I had been trying on and I never would have tried this type of dress on if it weren't for Greg. I am so glad I found him! The whole feel of the place is comforting and classy. I never felt rushed to make a decision-- and believe me when it came down to deciding between two dresses it took me awhile! In fact, after I decided on the dress Greg sat and talked to my mom and I for a half hour or so. He made us feel welcome. There is no doubt we are in good hands at Anne Gregory. From someone who looked all over NYC for a dress-- trust me-- just go to Anne Gregory-- you will be glad that you did!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you want kind and caring staff, as well as an artistic and cutting edge approach to keeping your skin young and beautiful, this is the place!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'll move this from a 1 star review to a 2 only because the young man helping me out was friendly - the rest of the experience was a damned disaster.\n\nPros:\n+ They changed my Oil.\n+ Previously mentioned worker was friendly.\n\nCons:\n-$140 for oil, tire rotation, air filter.\n-97 minutes from the time I pulled up till the time I left.\n-Restroom (air conditioned) smells better than the lobby (not air conditioned)\n-Roaches (both in the restroom and lobby)\n-$1.50 for a can of soda (only cold thing in the lobby)\n-Television in the lobby set at volume of 50, buttons broken so it cannot be turned off, turned down, or have the channel changed from Zoomba infomercials.\n-I was not allowed to drive my car into the shop - I had to let a sweaty greasemonkey do that.  He was literally dripping wet.\n- Have already sent three pieces of spam to my e-mail box despite not saying they'd do so when asking for my e-mail. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \n\nPlease support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of the best cheese steaks in the valley!  Can't wait to go back.  We tried to but they were closed for the day :-(\n\nTheir hours vary quite a bit by the day of the week (they cater mostly to the weekday lunch crowd) so if you are going on the weekend then check the hours.\n\nSome of their other offerings look good too, but I'm not sure I'd try them....I'm just there for the cheese steak and that is all....yum! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Bad location, but I could care less since I only order delivery from here late at night.  And oh my god, it tastes soo good.  The equation for the tastiness goes something like this...\nY = T*x^2\nwhere T is a function of how late it is,\nY is the Yum factor,\nand x...I don't know what x is, but it kind of spells \""tax...\""\n\nPrice is okay - delivery total is a few dollars more than what I usually pay for something like Gumby's with haxxor deals - and a bit higher than what you could get at Subway for $5 (but not as customizable).  However, they're open late, and some of their pre-mades, like the Cripple Creek are just too good to pass up.  Double 11-in. sub special is their best offer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Try the deep dish, the smallest size can easily feed 3-4 people, it's SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food, what more can you ask for? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'd heard great things about Blue, especially in the drinks department (I stuck with beer, this time though).  I visited on a weeknight, and enjoyed the darker, upscale ambiance.  However, based on previous reviews, the food is hit or miss.  My dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price. \n\nI ordered the mixed green salad and it was nothing special -- the dressing was blah and it was just regular goat cheese -- no crust, no heat, etc.  I ordered the NY Strip because the waiter said it was amazing, as did another member of my group.  Side note: the service was phenomenal, no problems in that department.  When it arrived, we both found the steak to be EXTREMELY tough.  I know it's not a filet, but you're supposed to be able to get your knife through it without breaking a sweat.  I didn't try my friend's steak, but he actually sent his back for being virtually inedible.  He swapped out for a filet with blue cheese and was quite pleased that he did.  Maybe I should have done the same....I don't know, but if you have to send your food back in order to get a decent meal, it's a pretty bad sign, especially at an expensive establishment.  In Blue's defense, I believe they were pretty upset about my friend's meal -- we basically got an entire desert tray for free.  Those were luckily delicious, as they made up a substantial part of my otherwise sub-par meal. \n\nBottom line, I will not go here again except for cocktails, some appetizers, and some jazz.  Or if someone else is picking up the tab. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best thrift store I've been to outside a major city.\nI rarely leave without finding something I love (AND HAVE TO HAVE!) and they stock everything from the occasional obi sash to fedoras to wigs to bridesmaid gowns to bomber jackets.\n\nSarah's impeccable taste ensures an incredible selection of pieces that really reflect their provenance: fifties dresses are cut like fifties dresses. Eighties blouses are true polyester eighties blouses. There are obscure labels and strange finds. It's the kind of place where you find a floaty skirt and automatically know it would make a great dress so you strap it 'round your chest and vogue in front of the mirror.\n\nThere are boots to match in the corner, you know.\n\nThe part I love the most is that the store is kept up so well that I never walk out with Goodwill hands and I don't feel like I need to give the clothing a chemical shower before I wear it. No wonder they've been around so long. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family visited for my son's 30th birthday. The table was decorated and a card signed by all the employees addressed to my son was at his spot. The food was perfect from the lobster bisque to the trio of ice cream. It's a favorite place of ours. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I LOVE this Location! Better than some of the others around town. We have been coming here since they opened and it is the main place we shop at for food. The store has come a long way and keeps getting better. They just finished the remodel and it looks Great.\n\nFantastic Produce, Meats, Fish, Seafood, Bulk items and an amazing Vitamin selection for a great value. They have both conventional and grass fed beef in the case as well as exotic game in the freezer section right in front of the butcher case. No fillers or weird stuff injected into any of the the meats like some of the bigger chain stores. Sausage made in house and very tasty. Bulk items are always fresh. You can get just the right amount you need. I cannot resist getting some of the Dark Chocolate items when I deserve a treat.\n\nI'm a vitamin freak and love the selection. If you spend $100 or more you get 10% right off the top and every few months they run a special called Vitamin Extravaganza where the whole department in 25% off everything before the 10% discount. What a deal and I feel GREAT!\n\nStore is always clean and the service is spectacular. Wednesday is Double Ad Day where the weekly specials crossover. It can get pretty crowded. Conveniently located in the same parking lot as In & Out. See you there next time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl \""white meat only\"" and ended up with a bowl of fat, gristle, skin, cartilage, and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the \""white meat only\"" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that, ever. \n\nIf you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit, go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand, but it's got veggies, delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor), rice, and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl. \n\nI'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went here for a quick bite with family before a play at Phoenix Theater.  I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try.  On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not-busy-at-all waitstaff hadn't cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of \""just OK.\""  The malt, ice-cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic.  But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24-hour bout of food poisoning traced back - by process of elimination - to McAlpines chicken salad.  I suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat, this is your place.  If you want to eat diner food without getting sick, go somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As far as Taco Bell go, this place is pretty great (you could say it is .....  SUPREME! Ha).   \n\nThe place is clean, the staff is friendly and smiley, they speak English I can understand, and the drive thru is always open. What more do you need? Of the 5 or so times that I have been here I don't think they've ever messed up my order at all -- which is pretty great considering it is a Taco Bell! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. \n\nI will not order from this place again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We came to eat to celebrate our anniversary (this as one of our first dates 14 years ago).  I called over a month ago to make the reservation and explained the purpose of our visit and asked if they could do anything for us when we came.  We arrived that night and were seated quickly.  Very crowded, very loud.  I didn't remember that from the last visit several years ago until we sat down and it came back to me very quickly.\n\nThe Waiter seemed distracted, but we managed to get our order.  The fried crawfish were great as a starter.  We then decided to get a few more appetizers and one entree to split.  When the gumbo came, we both decided it tasted like spicy water.  There was no flavor at all.  Even the shrimp had no taste.  It almost tasted like it was diluted to make it last the night or had just been sitting in the pot way too long.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he commented that he has never had it and that the main items are made in such large quantities, he didn't expect it would be very good.  What?!  Why would the waiter say that instead of \""I'm sorry sir, can we get you something else?\""\n\nThe rest of the meal was okay.  The Diane had more chicken than anything else (about 2 shrimp and 2 crawfish to go with three chicken breasts).  It lacked any flavor either and was kind of mushy.  The oysters were good and the crawfish scampi was good, but a bit on the greasy side.\n\nThe waiter never asked if we enjoyed our meal and never even said thank you for visiting.  He dropped off the ticket, picked it up and brought it back without saying word.  Customer service is just as important as the food, so that rates 0 stars.  He looked like we were in his way since we were only a 2 topper and he was losing money with us when he had other larger tables in his section.  The manager even walked by us several times and didn't even ask about our meal or acknowledge us.\n\nOverall, we were very disappointed at the experience.  It seems like they are running on their reputation and haven't done much to maintain or improve over the years.  We have eaten here since I arrived in Charlotte in 1996 and have had events there, etc.  This visit will change my mind of a repeat visit.\n\nOh, by the way, no one even mentioned our anniversary when I specifically asked when I made that reservation a month ago.  That is a big no-no. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please do not ration my hot sauce! When I say I want a lot that does not mean 2 thimbles instead of one. Also please warm up your precooked ingredients before you slap them in a burrito.\n\nI went on a trip here with a Friend after a hike, we were hungry, and his out of town guest wanted to try a \""taco stand\"" so after driving around the shadier parts of town for a bit we found this place. \n\n I ordered my usual Chile relleno burrito. Here they fill the space around the Chile with rice cheese and sauce. However my Chile it self was cool as if they just pulled it out of the refrigerator. The one surprising thing is that I did not get sick.\n\nMy Friends seemed content with their burritos however there was an extreme shortage of hot sauce, we shared it, then we fought for it, it was a truly sad scene. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What a disappointment. We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely \""small plates\"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\"" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Coffee is ok. The sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $7? I don't think so. I expected more. Their employees don't have uniforms but they are way too sloppy eve looks dirty. On a tank top all sloppy it doesn't look professional. I know it's a coffee shop but it says a lot. I like how they have the different coffee beans decor on the wall. That's pretty cool. Prolly won't come back <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The wait on weekends can be pretty bad, and if you try to call ahead, you may wait on hold for 10-15 minutes. Hopefully they're working on that. I've had many good meals here, usually ribeye, a baked potato and broccoli with a side salad. The food is consistent. I have a gluten allergy, and they have a good gluten free menu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is worth 4 stars due to the history, architecture and view. If you want a unique experience for a birthday/anniversary ect...this is the place. The restaurant on site had great service, but food was average. I'm not dying to go back for the food, but man do they have a great basil/lemon gimlet. WOW. Come here if you want to go back in time to the 30's for a nice dinner and/or drink. I will be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been to other Oregano's locations (South Tempe, Downtown Tempe and South Chandler) and have always had a very good experience.  This time I visited the Oregano's on Camelback and was pretty disappointed.  There were four of us at lunchtime.  Had to park on the street because the small lot was full.  No worries, that does not bother me really.  We were seated pretty quickly.  Ordered Lawrence's Original Pizza (my favorite there) as well as an Antipasto salad.  The pizza was good but took forever to arrive.  The salad was terrible and I had been so looking forward to it.  I may give them another chance at this location, but there are so many interesting places on my list to visit, it will probably not be for a long time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  the food was cold including the soup,fries.  the brisket was dry and the service was awful.  The ruben was awful. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This food is Americanized Chinese food-- not challenging, not different, and certainly not offensive to the American pallet. The food tends to be very salty (which Americans tend to like). It is dependable pedestrian food, the place is noisy, the parking lot crowded. \n\nThere are better places to eat Chinese than any of the Pei Wei's in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could give them 0 stars I would. It's not just bad service (and read the reviews, the service is beyond bad, it's insulting) these people are CROOKS. I used to live near one of these places and took my car in for an oil change and to have a squeaky belt replaced. I was told my car needed over $600 of service (too long a list to type here) and that \""All my belts\"" needed changing. I said, \""Oh, really\"" All of them?\"" And the mechanic replied \""Yes, you should do all of them at once, and it's $375.\"" People, my car has ONE belt. I took it to my regular mechanic and he installed it for free (it took about 10 minutes, and he charged me $20 for the belt!) along with replacing the old oil filter Fletcher's left on the car. RIP OFF WITH A BAD ATTITUDE! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We dropped by this place on a Fish Fry Friday which is a big night for Toby's. The place is so packed that they try to cut back on the time you take up at a table by having you order your food before being seated. You then stand around should to shoulder with other people who are waiting and you all have to work together to let the employees pass through. Our party was seated 20 minutes after ordering. \n\nMy bland plate of fish wasn't something I'll come back for. I'm just too use to food with seasoning on it. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ew,  I recently moved to this area and this is now my local Dairy Queen.  Who knew you could mess up a Blizzard so bad?\n\nFirst of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  \n\nI get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?\n\nWe get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.  And just walked away.  \n\nI walked out feeling very unsatisfied and my husband I determined this will be our last visit to the local DQ.  Besides the poor service, the food standards were disgusting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food was on point and very delicious,  however our waitress was NOT the deal. He wasn't very friendly and added extra food to the order, repetitive of things that I did order causing me to have lots of the same things.  He didn't explain how orders came and often heard us call him only to pause and glance in our direction. We were NOT rude or anything of that nature. Greens could have been a lil better instead of like leaves but other than that,  I loved it. I won't let that one black monkey stop my show! !! I will be back!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food & great service. We ordered delivery and when it arrived half of the sauce for the chicken had spilled in the bag. The man felt so bad and kept asking if it was ok. I wasn't bothered by it and said it was fine. About 5 min later we received a call from the restaurant apologizing and said they were going to deliver our meal again. I explained it was fine and they insisted at least bringing more chicken. Shortly after the man arrived again with a fresh order of hot chicken. I was very pleased with their service & the food tasted great! Awesome experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to I Do I Do because it was right down the street from my house. I had already purchased my wedding gown but still needed Bridesmaid dresses and Tuxes for the guys.\n\nOur original sales girl was great and very helpful. I had 9 girls in my party so dress shopping was a bit hecktic. I took 4 with me the first time, 2 had to make their own appointments and then I took the last 3 in...so I tried to make it as easy as possible. The store hours they keep are almost next to impossible to shop around, because twice they told me they didnt ALLOW bridesmaid dress shopping on satrudays...What business doesnt let customers come in to shop and GIVE THEM MONEY? Thats where all of our issues started\n\nThe assistant Mgr was the nasty girl ever. She made my bridesmaids feel unwelcome and she was very rude to me. The owner of the shop finally stepped in adn after that it was smooth sailing. \n\nDO NOT use the alterations person they recomend that is next door to them, they botched one of te girls dresses so badly it was almost unwearable! \n\nWe did get the guys tuxes through I do I do which carries the Jims Formalwear Line. The guys tuxes looked soooo good! We had only a slight issue with one of them not fitting and it was fixed asap! \n\nThey do have a good selection. They just need better staffing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you want to be treated rude by the staff and enjoy sub par smoothies then this is the place for you.   I love smoothies and had never been to a Smoothie King and was in the area so decided to give it a try.  Big Mistake!!  When I entered the store there was an older man towards the front and a younger girl making smoothies towards the back.   The place only had about two people in it.   No greeting given by the older man at the front.   The menu here is very, very hard to decipher.   The menu board is so discombobulated you don't know what end is up.   It lists the name of the smoothie for example, \""Cranberry Cooler\"" or \""Immune Builder\"" but they don't list what is in these smoothies.    You have to look at a \""to-go\"" menu to have the smoothie ingredients explained.   I asked the older man what was in the \""electrolyte mix\"" (as this was listed as part of the ingredients in a smoothie I was considering)  his answer to me was \""ARE YOU KIDDING?\""   \""You have electrolytes in your body.  They are minerals\""    I have no idea why I even continued with my order after this rude treatment.   Anyway,  I ordered a \""Light and Fluffy\"" smoothie.    Basic ingredients;  OJ, Banana, Strawberry.   It was average at best.     On the expensive side too.  Over $5.00 for a small.   Sorry for the long review but this place deserves only one star. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich, they will not care about you or whatever is wrong with your car. Also, their warranties SUCK. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Solid 3.5 stars for food and 4 for service and ambiance. \n\nInvited to join a few ladies I know for dinner before a Suns game, I was informed that reservations were made here.  Having not tried this downtown eatery yet, I was looking forward to the experience.  \n\nWhen I arrived, the ladies had ordered a bottle of a nice sturdy red wine, I was offered and accepted to be served but only requested a short pour, as I only wanted a taste.  I pretty much stuck to the water. \n\nThe server was very attentive and came back to check on us regularly.  When it came time to ordering I was quite appreciateive to the suggestions she offered.  I finally decided on a bowl of soup (shrimp and corn chowder) and the Ancho Pork empanadas.   In hindsight 2 rich choices but both quite tasty.  \nThe soup had at least 5 good sized shrimp, perfectly tender in a creamy base that was seasoned well and just enough spice to warm and not overwhelm the palate.  \nThe empanadas had seasoned pork, with a flavor similar to chorizo (garlic, chile, cumin), the crust was a flaky puff pastry.  This was served with a sweet citrus pepper marmalade that complimented the empanada well.  \n\nOverall I was pleased and I will have to go back to try again as I hear their happy hour is great. <|endoftext|>

I took my sick dog (chihuahua-dachsund mix) in yesterday because his symptoms were: not eating or drinking, fever, lethargic, and muscle contractions/shivering. I met with Dr. Babcock and felt uncomfortable almost right away with him. He called my dog a \""she\"" at first and said my dog might have parvo. I informed him that my dog (who is 2 years old) has already had parvo vaccinations, but Babcock still ran a test to make sure I wasn't lying. Sure enough, the parvo test came back negative. Then, he asked me what my money situation was, which I thought was completely unprofessional. He said some of his patients will spend thousands of dollars without question to help their sick animals but others cannot afford that much so there are other options. I told him I did not have thousands of dollars to throw down and he told me my other option would be to run an urinalysis, blood test, IV fluid, and antibiotic shot because my dog was in \""serious condition.\"" He said he was unable to give me any diagnosis until he ran some tests. All of my dog's tests came back negative. Later that day, Dr. Babcock followed up with me and I asked him if I should try giving my dog any food. He said no, that it would just make things worse. Well I later gave my dog some chicken soup and he ate all of it! And was fine afterwards. Dr. Babcock claimed that he thought my dog had an intestinal parasite which is why he didn't think I should give him food. Okay, if my dog had a fucking parasite, then he'd be throwing up! My boyfriend took my dog to a different vet today and they said he had a slipped disc in his neck from playing too much with other dogs. Why wasn't Dr. Stupidcock able to diagnose something like that??? Oh and the total amount I spent yesterday at Palo Verde was: $513.00. If you love your pet and want an honest diagnosis, do NOT go see Dr. Babcock! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We went this past Saturday with my sister-in-law and her husband.  She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here. \n\nI was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!\n\nFor our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.\n\nThe portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.\n\nFrom the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.\n\nMy only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I have been here twice and have loved it each time!  This is not only a nice place to go if you're craving something vegetarian.  They have great sandwiches and bowls that are enjoyable,  The pies are usually fantastic!  So many choices...I don't think you can go wrong.  For a place that looks like your classic greasy diner, it offers a more home-cooked feel with a veggie vibe.  Definitely worth checking out! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A really nice place, attentive service, and no complaints after five visits.  I agree with Steve V. that the eggplant appetizer is *really, really* good!  Also love the beet salad and the ribs.  Fish of the day has always been good, too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am reading through these reviews and wonder if we went to a different Lidia's Pittsburgh, because on our romantic Valentine's Day the Olive Garden would have been more fresh and authentic (p.s. it's neither of those things). My husband and I loved her cooking show and figured that her restaurant would be something we would like to try, boy were we way off. Maybe it was our fault for choosing a holiday but it was their fault for cutting corners, in the worst way possible, FLASH FROZEN FOODS!  They had a fixed menu with some options, but we already knew we were going to be charged $48 per person, which was pretty pricey, but maybe it was worth it, well it wasn't. First course was a fried ball that apparently had lobster in it, all you could taste is how much work the fryer had put in for the day, and it was a lot. Second course, couldn't wait, Caesar salad and a dish with shrimp and spaghetti squash,  salad was ok, the shrimp you couldn't taste because they were the little frozen ones that are cute when breaded but when they aren't they just look sad, as if they had never been in the sea (which I am banking these hadn't).  Then finally main entr\u00e9e, we held out hope thinking we there could still be a chance, again the price was $48 PER PERSON! My husband had gotten the tuna, JOKE, this made me maddest of all, it was pescado without the pescado part. We could have dealt with a small piece of FRESH tuna, but seeing as how this was an average piece of flash frozen crap with the grill marks already on it, thank goodness those poor chefs didn't have to actually grill a piece of fish. My pasta trio dish was ok, nothing about it screamed high and or fresh quality foods.  The worst part was that the service was excellent other than he could see on our faces we wanted nothing to do with the food, so he never asked how it was, but he was fantastic. So after the frozen crappy desert or finger food, that was horrid, we got our bill all said and done with a glass of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip, we paid $150.00! So save your money and go to spaghetti warehouse at least you know what you're getting.  Lidia, YOU OWE US MONEY! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This review is based on my experiences at various Hooters located all over the country and not necessarily at this one location. \nIf you've been to one Hooters you've basically been to all of them, the only visible change is the quality of the scenery. Having said that, Hooters has still managed to become an American institution. As most should know by now the food here is one cut above average at best, my nephew once found remnants of a feather in his wings! TASTY DUH! Then again, I don't think anyone goes to Hooters for the food. I've always thought that Hooters could expand their beer line up quite a bit but that has yet to happen.  My primary motivation to go here is to set the mood for the rest of the evening, is that simple! Another reason is logistics, this is a good staging area for when your new in town and need to get a feel for where the action is.\nI agree with Kimberly. Hooters is hooters. However I disagree with her rating! LOVE THIS PLACE! <|endoftext|>

She knew what I was looking for and she suggested dresses I didn't even think to try on.  I expected to pay thousands of dollars for such a beautiful and unique designer gown.  Alterations are very affordable, too. The Assistant Manager, Erica, was caring and very helpful and she made sure our experience was nothing short of wonderful. Thank you, Ariana and Erica!  With your help, I found the perfect gown for my special day.  I can't wait for my wedding day! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome, honest guy. Took my car in today because I thought I needed my brake pads replaced. He took a look at them with me there and let me know that it looked like I still had some life in them but he would put the car on the lift to check the brake pads on the inside. He confirmed that I still had a few thousand miles left in them and that it was safe to drive. Never had a mechanic not try to sell me on something. I appreciate him saving me the money for now. I will definitely be going back to him for all future needs. Word of advice, there is no sign out front and it's a one man shop so call first to set an appt if you can. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We found this place by chance, thank goodness. It is the best appliance store I've ever been in! Randy Rice has assisted us with several purchases. That guy knows EVERYTHING about the appliances they sell and never makes you feel like he's hard-selling. We've ended up with exactly what we hoped for each time we go in. The delivery and installation is always on time and trouble-free. No, they don't have the super cheap brands like big box stores, but they do have a moderate range of appliances (like GE) as well as luxury models (like Miele).  When you are looking for quality appliances and expert knowledge, definitely go here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I got engaged here a few years ago, we celebrate our anniversary here every year, and each year it has been amazing and has gotten better. This year, was by far, the best year yet. The new chef is amazing, far better than the previous one. The food pairings are amazing, never had foods that went so well together. Our waiter was great, he knew the menu and suggested amazing dishes. \nThe dishes are on the smaller side, but that is so you can have a full 3 course meal. I'm not big on trying new things, but this is the only place that I will try something new. Love coming out here, the atmosphere is impeccable, the singer the bar had, was not loud, she was singing at a very reasonable, soft level that made the experience that more enjoyable.\nI personally think the quality of food is worth the prices. I know that this isn't your Mimi's or Taco Bell, this is a nice, fancy place that we go to once or twice a year, so we don't mind forking over the cash :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I visited Merc Bar for the 3rd time on Thursday night to meet some friends. I was never that impressed by it before, but wasn't opposed to it like I am now after that night. We had to signal one female server over so someone at my table could order another beer. She responded like she was being inconvenienced. When a \""Boulder Hazed and Confused\"" was ordered, she looked like the guy was crazy and said, \""I don't think we have that\"" to which he replied, \""I just had one.\"" So, not only was she annoyed by having to serve us, she didn't even know the bar menu like the back of her hand like any good server would.\n\nOn to my difficulties in getting a drink: a male server came over to bus our table and take any orders. I ordered another glass of wine, and over the next 20 minutes, I watched him serve/bus other tables, hug patrons, and open a Christmas gift. No vino for me. The only positive part of the night was when I went to the bartender, told him what occurred, and he comped my wine. The bartenders seem less aloof, so I suggest getting all of your drinks from them.\n\nThe Merc Bar seems to be one of those places to go if you're only interested in being seen, mingling with douchey patrons, and you're not concerned about receiving good service (even though their mixed speciality drinks command $12). It is like the Neiman Marcus of bars, where some of the employees act like they are better than you are, even though they work there and you're the one there spending money. On the upside, they had a band and their seating is inviting, but the wait staff remove that vibe almost immediately. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I ate here for brunch on Sunday.  It's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  It included a mimosa/bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate.  I had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  All was great.  They could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  The bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be returning for brunch! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \n\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \""Asian Bistro.\"" <|endoftext|>

Will definitely be going back for the next big game! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and  the atmosphere, so I'm sad to have to write a review that speaks poorly about the place.  Having said that, my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated.  While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated.  When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd!  We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up.  \n\nI would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Poor, slow service. Food that was just okay. A manager who didn't want to make an effort to address either issue. The worst part was when we saw another table's food being brought out, with one plate of food stacked halfway on top of another plate of food. I would have flipped if I'd seen that with my order.\n\nI realize they were busy, I realize that our server was (by his admission) new. Doesn't excuse the fact that we didn't see him from the time we ordered to the time we got our check. Someone else brought our food. And the manager just blew off the mistakes. I wouldn't bother. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.\n\nMy friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.\n\nMy only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.\n\nHOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall. <|endoftext|>

The staff was nice buti was always waiting 30 mins to an hourafter my scheduled appointment.  Dr. O'sullivan was always very short with me and made me feel dumb for asking questions.  When I gave birth,  she told my family to shut up before my baby entered the world,  which is just plain rude.  Her nurse practitioner was awesome and that's who I saw about 90 percent of my visits.  But the Dr. I'm glad I will never go back to her clinic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had been wanting to stop by this place for a while, and finally decided to do it today. I was hoping for a bigger selection of salads, but it's a 'deli,' so it can't really bother me that salads aren't their main thoroughfare. I opted for the Supreme (Turkey, Bacon and Cheddar) on wheat with lettuce, tomato and onion; I think I got Provolone instead of Cheddar but I'm not complaining. The bacon was wonderfully crispy, the turkey was thin and absolutely delicious, and the pickle (spear on the side) was cold, crispy and yummy. I got applesauce on the side instead of fries...I only took a couple bites (waaaay too full), but it's very good and it's chunky; not quite so pureed as traditional applesauce. I don't know if they have it made for them or if it's some applesauce you can buy that I wasn't aware of, but I like it. I'll definitely be back at some point, and I'll probably get the same sandwich.\nThe servers were also very friendly; all in all it was a satisfactory visit.\n\n\n**Update**\n\nI SWEAR when I was first typing this, it had the Scottsdale address. This is in reference to the Scottsdale Promenade location; I have never been to the Camelback one. \n\nThat is all :) <|endoftext|>

We went to the the back room and small patio area to join some friends who were part of a large party.  \n\nThere was hardly any room back there either and the server ignored us for most of the night.  We had to serve ourselves by going into the bar.  We also had to bus our own tables because nobody came out to clean up.  Also, the back room was very muggy and humid....this can't be the first time they've done large parties, right?!\n\nLike I said, I expected more out of this place and left disappointed.\n\nReturn Factor - 10% <|endoftext|>

Not only are you guaranteed to enjoy your food, you are guaranteed to be satisfied / hardly able to finish it all! Why, you ask? WELL:\n\n1) All dinner combos come with a hearty entree, a big mound of rice, and a side item.\n2) The combos cost anywhere from $7-10 bucks: affordable!\n3) Customizable entrees: choose the sauce and the veggies!\n\nI personally went with a spicy black bean sauce, and elected chinese eggplant as my vegetable of choice, served alongside the trio of beef, pork, and shrimp. It was delicious and I will definitely come back and try out different combinations! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \""temporary lobby\"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here once, so this is sort of a \""first-impression\"" review.  I've always heard good things about the Spaghetti Warehouse, and I'm one to love a great dish of spaghetti and meatballs!\n\nA friend of mine had a buy-one-get-one coupon from the local newspaper, so the two of us ate for the price of one. Our bill, including tip, was $20. \n\nThe spaghetti I ordered was fabulous, but the lasagna my buddy ordered looked even better!  This lasagna was huge.   I love that you get bread and salad with your pasta dish.\n\nThe decor is pretty cool, and the place is large. Free parking was a plus!  The only complaint I would offer here is that our waitress seemed to be very disinterested in her job. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but she just wasn't very friendly.\n\nNonetheless, I'll go back!  Good food, good decor, generally good service! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ventured in to the Harmony to celebrate the closing of my new house; turns out it's located about 1.5 blocks from my new pad, so I have a feeling I'll be getting more familiar with The Harmony.\n\nWhat a cool place. Awesome bar, plenty of seating, live music (although with a cover charge...boo), great beer selection, and really solid food.\n\nI tried the classic cheeseburger; patties were hand-formed and cooked to a perfect medium. Cheese curds came from a bag, but were some of the better ones I've ever tried. The house-made pub chips were excellent.\n\nA small group of us ate and drank for a few hours; the total tab came to just over $60, which is an absolute bargain. Service was prompt and efficient, making for a great overall experience.\n\nI'll be back (a lot)!\n\nOh, and check out the daily food specials - looks like they have some inventive and interesting options! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A very interesting spot in downtown Champaign.  A tapas bar, beer bar, brunch spot on the weekends, cocktail bar, and what else?  I am probably missing something...\n\nTables spread out up front.  A blue lit bar, and a spinning wheel of taps.  Strange lighting, and can get very loud later at night.  Artsy and hip without being completely pretentious.  Just a little though.\n\nService can be a bit slow, but always friendly and knowledgeable.  Beer list is always rotating.  Founders, Dark Horse, Ballast Point, plenty of other US micros and a good selection of imports.  I think the wheel has about 30 taps.  Then a creative cocktail menu, which I have yet to try.  Outside of Blind Pig, this was one of the first true beer bars in the area.\n\nFood is interesting.  A mix of tapas, other small plates, and brunch.  Hanger Steak is good, as is the duck.  Not everything is a hit, but there is enough good stuff to keep you coming back.  Like bone marrow, pork shoulder, and ricotta.  \n\nThis is definitely a place to check out downtown.  An interesting mix of different bar and restaurant concepts.  Good beer, interesting and often very good food.  Good spot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came\nHere for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place, I was .... Starters food is nothing outta the ordinary,,one funny thing that stood out was when we asked our server if they served any other meats aside from pork based meats she responded BACON! And no not turkey bacon... So clearly lil off there...  Other then that we order common breakfast .. Which was ok... I had the western omelette with turkey sausage ... The peppers and the onions were not sliced small enough and were overpoweringly huge ... Lil less On that lil more on the egg,,.. Which I wonder if the eggs were made from liquid base out of a carton ... Yeah so place was ok if u wanna eat in desperation ... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Is it Authentic? - yes.\n\nBut...I wanted to like this place and I can't. Maybe because I'm not a fan over-salted greasy sonoran food with the loud speakers from an over-amplified one man band 5 feet from my ears while I'm trying to hold a conversation. The indigestion was not a pleasant souvenir.\n\nIf I want very loud music, I'll go to a concert but it's not appropriate at a \""family restaurant\"".  Put it this way - my (almost) 4 year old was on the edge of tears because her ears were hurting from the crappy music.  \n\nNext time I'm here and want Mexican food, I think I'll just go to Teakwoods Tavern in the same parking lot and order Nacho's and a bucket of Coronas instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start out by saying this place was amazing when I first moved here a year ago, but then things started going down hill fast. I have nothing, but good things to say about Tomas and Carolyn as they show amazing customer service and treat people with true professionalism. Unfortunately though they do not run the property! \n\nProblems I have had here include:\n\n1) Poor and extremely unprofessional help along with lack of integrity from apartment head Donna.\n\n2) Very slow response time for maintenance requests.\n\n3) Very poor AC units! I live in a 1 bedroom unit with my air set at 79 and am paying $210 a month. This may be due to the horible insulation and sealing of the apartment.\n\n4) Horrible plumbing. The toilets don't flush well due to horrible water  pressure.\n\n5) Rates change constantly here and they are always adding new charges.\n\nI started out paying $723 and now am at $998 a month. And this place has not improved the living conditions worth raising the rent costs.\n\nI could not in my right mind recommend this place to anyone. By far the worst apartment complex I have ever lived at. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been a regular at Myle's nails for years.  The service has been spotty as is in many discount nail salons but I've returned because the prices are very competitive and nothing terrible has ever happened...until now.\n\nThe last time I went in for a full set of gels the technician was extremely rough and couldn't understand what I was saying when I told him he was hurting me.  He ground down my pinky nail trying to remove an ink stain that I said was fine and to please leave it be.  It left a painfully sensitive divot in my nail.  Also, he was so rough with the sanding drill and nail file that when I left, every one of cuticles was bleeding.  My fingers were throbbing for two days until they scabbed over.\n\nI decided to call and talk to the manager who told me I was \""too nice\"" and that I should have \""stood up and said something\"" about the poor nail job.  He told me that in the future I should call ahead and request someone different (even though they accept walk ins).  He tried to make me feel like it was my fault. \n\nI have worked in customer service for almost 5 years and I am not one to complain in order to receive free services or goods. However, the manager should have at least offered me a free manicure to make up for such a bad experience.\n\nI won't be back :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So slow. One cashier and 5 customers!!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere, my suggestion go elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent atmosphere, great for a romantic date, good mood lighting, and knowledgable staff. The food was fantastic and I nearly just ate the bread they served as filler. I had the chicken cacciatore which came recommended by the waiter, I'd definitely go back here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ryan's isn't exactly a secret but I didn't know about it until recently. Any phx pet owner really should know about this warehouse. Why pay twice as much for a crate, leash, toy, etc at a normal store? Besdies food and some specialty items, I will buy everything here from now on! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Last time I went I was very disappointed in the service. We had a large group so I can understand it taking a little longer than normal but our server took forever to ask us what we wanted to drink (we were a little later than the rest of the party who already had a drink). Also all the TVs were on a preface channel while there was another game that was actually on. I don't think I'd ever pick to go there again. Will only go if someone else wants to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Vignettes is a fantastic store! The store is full of unique items that make great gifts for every occaision. Their baby room is wonderful and full of soft and sweet little things, great little infant clothing and accenssories and nursery items. Their selection of gifts at Christmas is unmatched! You must check this store out if you haven't. You will be so happy to have found it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What else can you add when every time we eat here it is so delicious ... Edward and his team of servers are remarkable ! Shrimp steamer for me and pan seared shrimp for the hubs and finished off with a mango cake with chocolate sauce ... Delectable food with remarkable service makes for a wonderful experience - Every Single Time <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The woman at the counter gave my daughter the stink face when we tried to drop off several items for cleaning. \n\nShe was rude the entire time, huffing when I asked how long the service would take. \n\nWe took the clothes back and left, will find somewhere that appreciates the customers a little more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok, I'm all for dive bars.  Places with a place to belly up and have a few.  But c'mon, this place smelled a bit.  Like someone took a leak in the corner.\n\nI showed up because of the Yelp reviews.  Was looking for a place to kill some time playing pinball.  Yeah, one drink of Ye Ole PBR and I was outta there.\n\nThe pee smell was just too much. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Get your wallet out! This place nickel and dimes you to death and they seem proud of it. \n\nI buy a room for a night and a conference room for a day. In the lobby and my sleeping room I get free internet but when I walk in the conference room they want to rob me of $50.00. The workers were embarrased to tell me this and when I asked to speak to someone in charge they told me the managers will not discuss it. \n\nIf that is not enough they jab me for another $2.65 for a cup of coffee to include a refill. \n\nI don't care how nice the place is (and it is nice) I will not come back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had the brisket and the bbq beef sandwich + sides.  Everything was no good.  The meat was dry the sides were bland.  If you're looking for good BBQ in the Phoenix area I recommend Honey Bears or Bobby Q's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded.    Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner.  Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table.  Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate!\n\nPasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great.  $20 for noodles and meat sauce... \n\nDinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices.    Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had.  \n\n Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent.  I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!\n\nOverall a very disapointing night out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was my second and most likely last time attending this restaurant.  Reason for this statement is our waitress topped off my glass of water with water from a glass not a pitcher. Who fills a patrons glass like that? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We just loved it... a lot food... spicy upon request.. good service. . Ill go there again for sure.. loved there iced thai coffee.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I booked this hotel on Expedia at a great rate for one night while passing through. I was actually pretty impressed with it! Carowinds amusement park is right across the street. The hotel was clean and well kept. It didn't feel run down like the last 2.5 star I stayed at. Check in went smoothly. The people at the desk were very friendly. I stayed on the 3rd floor. The room had two queen beds, a low dresser with flat screen tv, and a mini fridge & microwave. The bathroom is on the smaller side but had a decent amount of counter space. The free wi-fi was easy to connect to and speeds were good. My only complaint about the room... the wall mounted heating/cooling unit was pretty loud.\n\nThe continental breakfast (6:30-9:30 am) was one of the better ones I have seen. They had cold cereals, instant oatmeal & grits, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, eggs, sausage, a good selection of breads & pastries, fresh fruit, a waffle making station, and, of course, juice & coffee.\n\nAdded bonus: There is a Wendy's across the parking lot in case the late night craving for a Frosty strikes... Yes, the thought crossed my mind! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very nice hotel. Had a King bed with a whirlpool tub. The best part was the tv in the mirror in bathroom. Hotel had complimentary tea, coffee and cookies. The reason I took a star off was because we prepaid with one credit card at a certain rate, and upon checkout were billed again for the night for a totally different rate. The front desk did finally take care of this. Also at breakfast there was no food ready and we had to wait about 15 mins. Other than that the hotel was very nice <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been going to The Great wall of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the \""Crispy Scallops\"". The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the \""Steamed Veggie Dumplings\"" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The \""Crab Rangoon\"" is okay. The \""Spring Rolls\"" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the \""Sa Cha Scallops\"" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wide variety on coffee & teas - even cigars. Relaxed atmosphere & friendly people.  Lots of flavored coffees, though I'm not a huge fan flavored coffees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The ice cream machine is Always broken after 9pm AMAZING, this is 6 out of 6 attempts AMAZING.  This is at the McDonald's at the entrance to the airport, really the Ice-cream machine is Always broken after 9? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Page's has was a staple of my childhood and young adult life.  There ice cream is great and their prices are good--evident by the line that is always out to Carson St.   I wish they had a tent with seating.  It rains. . .ALOT in Pittsburgh.  Eating in your car is the signature of this place but I wish there was some covered seating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been to Discovery Place several times since moving to Charlotte, and I've never been disappointed. \n\nI went the first time to check out the Body Worlds exhibit, which blew me away. I'd wanted to see that exhibit for a few years after hearing about it on television, but I'd never had the chance. I was thrilled that it was right here in Charlotte. \n\nMy second trip was with my 4 year old niece to let her enjoy all the kid-friendly permanent exhibits, and she had a great time. She especially enjoyed the big pendulum that you can use to draw that's by the main entrance to the museum...although we had to wait in line behind the other kids, which wasn't a lot of fun. \n\nI also went to see A Night at the Museum in their IMax theater. I thought it would be a good one to see, but it was a little overwhelming in that it wasn't truly an IMax film...it was just a regular movie shown BIG. If I go back to see another IMax, I'll see a film designed for the theater. I went to an IMax film at the dome in Galveston, Texas a few years ago, and it was awesome. Even though my experience in Discovery Place's theater wasn't as breathtaking, I am glad that we have one in town.\n\nI also recently checked out the Pompeii exhibit, which was a lot of fun. I've been to Pompeii before, and even so, this exhibit was worth checking out, and I saw things that I didn't see on the tour of the ruins. The plaster casts of the people and animals are poignant, but the other artifacts are surprisingly interesting, and the art is beautiful. \n\nI wish the parking wasn't so pricey, but overall, Discovery Place is a great resource here in town. They always show the morbid, creepy-cool exhibits, which are right up my alley. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is overrated,  the food is NOT authentic at all.  California is where the real Mexican food is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Quite the ironic name for this restaurant.  I think their name should start the term \""Americanized\"" or \""subdued.\"" The dishes on the lunch buffet were standard but they lacked the vigor that good Indian food has. \n\nI have gone here a few times for lunch with co workers, the vegetarian selection is decent. The fried items can be a bit soggy from sitting out too long.  The lunch buffet now is topping $10 which is pretty steep of a mediocre lunch. I feel like there should be a discount at places like this for vegetarians. The Naan, and water is brought tot you by a server so you may feel the need to tip on top of the buffet price. \n\nThere is the stereotypical bollywood music videos playing on the TV, with their psychedelic colors and lavish garb. Many of the serving trays make extensive use of aluminium foil which I doubt meets health code. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had a 5-course meal and wine pairings.  The wine is why I gave it 2-stars; otherwise would've been worse as food was very bland.  No creativity to the cooking.  I enjoy extremely nice meals but McNinch is way overpriced for what you get. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i hope the owners and/or management read this review so they can be made aware of the terrible experience i had at noon today (2/21/13).  unfortunately i don't know the name of the female employee working during this time-she was on the short side with long, dark hair in a ponytail.  several sales were lost today due to her total incompetence. \n\n-\n\n\ni should have known when i walked in and received no greeting from the barista that this was going to be a stellar time. \n\nthere was only one other customer standing at the counter, and two women waiting for their coffee to be made.  \n\nas i approached the counter, i realized that what i originally thought was a customer was actually a friend of the barista's. the two of them were completely engrossed in some conversation about who knows what while the barista finished the coffee for the two waiting women. \n\nonce she finished, i waited for her to acknowledge me and take my order.  instead, she continued right on with her conversation with her pal, never breaking to say hello or even make eye contact!  instead, the two of them kept on chatting while she started making herself a coffee! \n\nmeanwhile, another customer walked in and stood behind me at the counter.  the two of us exchanged a few perplexed looks as the barista/pal nonsense continued on with no end in sight. after several minutes of this, he decided to give up and leave. the barista took no notice of this.  \n\nat that point, i glanced at my phone and realized i had been standing there for a full ten minutes! ten minutes, debit card in hand, standing two feet from the barista with not even the slightest acknowledgement whatsoever. \n\nwas it possible that i died in the car ride to hava java and no one could see me? \n\nthat was enough for me. i backed away from the counter and got the hell out of there. \n\n \nhava java-you should be absolutely ashamed at how this employee is treating your customers. i do not plan to ever return, and i'm sure the other customer who walked out will be thinking twice about where he gets his coffee from now on. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc.  She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.  They refuse to put in the ramp.  I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.  Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!  SHAME ON YOU CATHY! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family and I totally loved staying at this hotel while we were visiting Phoenix.  Surprisingly, the rates at this Embassy Suites was very affordable unlike others located in places like San Diego.  The location of this hotel was a bit sketchy.  During the day, it looked decent but at night, it wasn't very well lit and I recall there were many loiterers on the street.  You just didn't get the sense that you were in a good neighborhood. \n\nAnyways, on the property, everything was just fine.  The rooms were a little dated but still very comfortable.  I didn't get the sense that the rooms were unclean.  Everything seemed properly cleaned/washed.  The tv again was a bit old (don't know if they have remodeled since the last time I was there though).   Aside from this minor issue, the rooms were spacious.  What more can you ask for? Clean and spacious.\n\nI thought the breakfast was fabulous.  The have their standard made-to order omelet station.  There are an assortment of breakfast items like breads, pastries and fruit on the side.  We totally enjoyed our delicious breakfast.  They also had a welcome hour where they provided vegetables and some snacks.  All in all, we had a lovely time.  This hotel contributed to our enjoyable time in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good plate lunch. You can't go wrong if you order spam musubi, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken or BBQ beef.\n\nReasonable price and delicious food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst service ever.  No one cares, was lied to, wasted my time, twice and ended up demanding a refund and taking business elsewhere.  NEVER AGAIN. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you are looking for the perfect spot for a first date, this is it!\nQuaint, romantic, and homey are a few words that come to mind.\nBut the best part for me is; you can not have a bad meal here if you tried, that being said Pollo Cubano is my favorite dish! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why do people like this place?  Can't they buy a loaf of sliced bread, some deli meat and some dijon mustard at any grocery store and make a comparable sandwich?  I am a long time Phoenix resident, and I have always thought this place was BORING!  I have to meet people here once  in a while, and always make up the excuse that I have already eaten. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you want a cozy dive bar, this is it.  Ask for the \""mystery shot\"" and go for it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Haven't been to the Havana Cafe in years.  Forgot all about it until a friend suggested that we have lunch there.  The service was great and so was the food.  Can't remember what the name of the entree was that I ordered, but it was spicy shredded beef with  two skewers of grilled zucchini and mushrooms and plantains as well .... all very good!  \n\nI will put Havana Cafe on the rotation of lunch time spots! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Never heard of BJ's until I received a free 60 day membership in the mail.  After visiting this store, I know realize why they send FREE memberships.  I found it extremely off-putting to be greeted by the smell of old food at the entrance.  It has a gloomy atmosphere and is relatively small. \n\nI was unable to justify spending $50 or $100 for their membership.  Especially, since I didn't see any significant savings on the items that I would be interested in purchasing (paper & cleaning products).   I do think it is cool that they accept coupons and all forms of payment.  \n\nUltimately,  BJ's is too grimy, smelly and disheveled looking for me.  It is definitely Costco's distant, twice removed cousin. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  NEVER have I been stranded at an airport because a reserved vehicle was unavailable.  I arrived in Madison---on time---with a confirmed RESERVATION made through Enterprise's website.   I waited at the counter for over 5 minutes while the agent talked to a co-worker or friend on the phone.   When she was done and I handed her my ID and credit card and told her I had a reservation she said \""that won't do you any good\""  \""We are out of cars\"".  I asked how long of a wait and she said \""maybe an hour----maybe not until tomorrow\"".    So having traveled thousands of miles today, I am now stranded at the airport.  She offered no options----no taxi service, etc.  NOTHING...and on top of it she was RUDE and offensive in her handling.   She took great delight in informing me that there were fourteen others waiting in front of me that also didn't have cars.   \n\nFortunately, a travel companion had a reservation with HERTZ who handled his reservation professionally and quickly.   I got a ride from him to my hotel and will deal with this fiasco tomorrow morning.   You can rest assured I will NEVER RENT FROM ENTERPRISE AGAIN.      \n\nAwful does not begin to describe tonight's experience.   She's one heck of a good will ambassador for the Madison area.  \n\nWord of advice---if you think your reservation with Enterprise guarantees a car, guess again.  Cancel and go with a reputable company <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The drinks are so weak here that I had to order a vodka shot to put in my vodka martini and a whiskey shot to put in my whiskey sour. It tasted like water before. Any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice. And they aren't cheap drinks, so that's ridiculous. The food is good though. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp.  I love to eat tapas in my hometown and was a little skeptical whether or not this place could live up to my LA expectations.  Radio Maria did not disappoint!\n\nFirst off, I loved the atmosphere.  The architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique.  It's beautiful.  I love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially.  \n\nThe dim lighting and the small bites menu definitely makes it a great place to go out with friends or to go on a date.  The drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too.\n\nI had the lamb meatballs, the bread with fig jam,  and the bread with serrano pork and orange marmalade and the potatoes.  I'm forgetting the name of each dish but they are on the tapas menu. Everything I ordered was great, but the potatoes were AMAZING!  They were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked.  They also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce, I wish I knew the ingredients so I could re-create this dish.  I can't wait to come back to have them again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is a local gem.  They do such a great job and pay amazing attention to detail.  My car looked better than new after spending a few hours getting detailed at Lindstrom's.  If you need your car detailed, this is the place to go.  Good prices and high quality work. \n\nThe employees are friendly.  As this is a hand car wash, you will need to be prepared to spend a little time here - but it's totally worth the wait! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yes the Barrymore has a solid East Side vibe, and decent acoustics but from the patron's point of view it is a pit.  The seats are cramped and uncomfortable.  The dance area is small and you get the hairy eyeball from the cranky front rowers if you want to groove.  I've seen them throw people out for even dancing a foot into the aisle...at John Hiatt!  If you end up in the balcony- give it up and go home.  Don't even want to mention the bathrooms, dirty taps and awful popcorn.  And yes it is in perpetual decline and there seems to be no will to fix it up.  Maybe the various east side music fetes should pool their resources and work on that.  But my biggest beef of all is the lack of reserved seating.  Completely asinine.  Why make people wait outside for an hour or more to attend an event.  What? Do you think it \""builds character\""? Sorry, it is just stupid. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As I read some of the reviews, I recall the place BEFORE the renovation, and yeah I could see how it might not be anything special. Now, I think it's probably the best hotel in Champaign. Everyone there is super friendly and I think it's gotten a lot nicer! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food has gotten so much better. the vegetarian 24K rocks my world with Thai pumpkin, eggplant, veggies in spicy green curry. get it hot!!! delicious. service is fast and friendly too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The Food was good.. However, they were very shady at the end. The check came, I looked at it and it was right. I gave them my card and the manager (not the waiter) brought me back the check having been authorized for a different amount (about $10 more). He claimed \""things were missing\"" from the original check. I asked for the detail and he left.. the Waiter came back in 10 minutes looking for the signed check. I told him the manager was bringing me the details, he left... 10 minutes later after asking 2 more times I decided $10 wasn't worth it and I signed it and left. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The most dependable upscale restaurant I know in Phoenix. First-rate dishes, like melt in your mouth osso bucco and a huge and delicious veal chop, at reasonable prices. Reservations essential. Don't miss their calamari. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been here a few times and loved it every time. my favorite items are the popusas, pan con pollo, and the sopa De pata. If you like menudo you'll like the sopa De pata. I give all the credit to my girlfriend for introducing me to this place. I owe her big time. Yummy yummy for the tummy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been to the Phoenix Zoo twice now. The first time was 3 weeks ago in 104 degree temp. Awful experience. We only went around the big animals side so my daughter could see them. All the animals were tired, hot and sleeping. They looked miserable and we were miserable too. The water mists did not help one bit.\n\nWe also went this past weekend when the temperature was a high of 76 degrees. Heaven!!! Loved the zoo. Had so much fun. No need to rush. We just relaxed. All the kids were in a great mood. People were smiling, laughing, just having plain ol fun. The animals seemed alive and active. Just a beautiful experience. The Arizona Trail is great. It might have been good to go there with the hot temperatures as well. Some animals are hard to see because of the layout in the cages. The cages are smaller than needed for some of these large cats and other wild life. The Orangutans have a little baby Orangutan in it and he just hangs and plays while the big guys sleep. It was really cool. My favorite part is the giraffes. There were 5 of them this last time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is nice. Clean and bright. A lot of available washers and dryers. Must convert money into a card to use for this laundromat. No coins, cards, or cash going into the machines. Bring cash. They have tvs up also if you get bored. In a good area. I would come here again. Hopefully I don't need to though. Let's get that washer fixed! <|endoftext|>

They said its close come back tomorrow at 9am I went next day at 9am but it was still close never open waited there for 30 minutes and  I went to another candy store the name is Mayra's the lady was very helpful and nice!!!!!!! and thanks for letting me express my self...... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family comes here once a year, every year, for my uncle and sister-in-law's birthday and we do the whole Sunday brunch thing. \n\nI would have to say the best thing about the place, even though the food is really very good, is the ambiance. Its an experience that from the second you pull into the driveway at the Royal Palms Hotel begins to surround you and cut you off from the outside world. The hotel itself is modeled like a Spanish villa, and the restaurant maintains this theme with large round hardwood tables that could probably support the weight of an elephant, a huge fireplace, exposed beam ceiling, wrought iron fixtures and embellishments, and Spanish tile on the floors. Everything seems very calculated down to the smallest detail including silverware and water pitchers that look to be hand hammered.\n\nThe brunch thing is a little odd in how its constructed in that there is a buffet brunch which is more than enough to have as a meal, but there are also menu items which you can order in addition to the buffet. The odd thing is that everything is priced such that if you go for just the buffet, it costs more than if you were to get the buffet in combination with a meal, and in the end by ordering a meal you wind up paying a dollar or two more. Very strange. As such, it always seems worth it to me to get a menu item even if you're not that hungry and just have whatever you dont eat boxed up to take home and eat later.\n\nThe food is really very good. I cant really complain about anything, but I will just say that there are certain shortcuts that are taken that are noticeable. For example, on the buffet they have kinda a gourmet version of home fries with onions and peppers and whatnot in it. I ordered an egg white omelet that was advertised as having potatoes, onions and peppers in it, but didnt really think that what would come was literally egg whites with the buffet dish mixed in. I mean, the dish was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it probably would have been better if the potatoes onions and peppers had been prepared a little differently...a different cut or a different cooking method--something to mix it up a little.\n\nThe price isnt cheap, roughly 22-28 bucks per person for the buffet/menu item combo (21 for buffet only), but this is not the kind of thing you do every day. Its a special occasion kind of deal and I think that generally speaking its well worth it. The waitstaff is very attentive and they tend to be very unintrusive as well. I appreciate that especially when you're trying to have a special lunch out with the family. \n\nOverall, I would say this is a fantastic place to go if you're looking for a romantic dinner or a classy brunch every so often. Its a good solid choice any time, every time...especially if you like home fries! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just recently moved up here to Phoenix and was looking for something good to eat. I started looking through things on Yelp and found this place. it took me forever to find it and I called and the lady helped me find it. Well I definitely found it. I went and the lady working was so friendly and helped me pick out what to eat. And the found was delicious!!!!  I had the number 1. I definitely recommended it to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nothing like a touch of yogurt on a hot (or cold) day.  The owners are so friendly, I love it.  The smell of sugar cones wafting in the air when you walk in is heavenly.  Something about this yogurt here, I don't know what it is but it tastes so good and creamy and not a chemically tone to them at all.  It tastes real, fresh and plopping down inside is a perfect way to enjoy some time away from the office and watch the busy-ness going on around you outside. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. \n\nThe good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp, the sauce with bread dipped in.\n\nThe bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture. \n\nThe final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, \""add boiling water to reconstitute,\"" grits. Culinary blasphemy.\n\nI will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  About once a week, the husband convinces me that we need pizza.  Ideally, we would get a real one made by people and not a chain.  But, this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza.  We would have to drive somewhere to get a good pie, and we're just not having that.\n\nI have a confession to make.  Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.\n\nAnd, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.\n\nWe ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.\n\nThey have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.\n\nWe ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.\n\nThe marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star\n\nThe delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.\n\nThe order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars\n\nI would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'll just add my 2 cents on how fun, happening, and great this place is. The coffee totally awesome. The bakery items impossible to choose. I had a very very good tuna sandwich then noticed the pizza's on other tables and had to try it. Had the margehrita and it was spectacular. Gooey cheese, chewey crust, superior ingredients. The staff here from the pizza guy to the counter people to the clean up crew......very friendly, real, and beyond efficient. \n\nThe atmosphere here is just real comfortable and fun. A wide variety of seating styles......from indoor table , to community table, bar,outdoors garden, oudoors sidewalk, indoors amongst the grocery shoppers......\n\nA very cool place.....can be difficult to park there sometimes but just presevere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I got delivery and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it was over done for my liking and colder than I expected. It still tasted good so I popped it in the oven and that helped enough to be able to enjoy it. They forgot my drink when they made the delivery but the driver went back and got my drink and returned in under 10 minutes. That alone is why I'm giving it 4 stars because being a delivery driver myself in the past, I understand how easy it can be to forget something small and when you're really busy so it's hard to be quick with bringing the missing items while keeping up with other orders. I will definitely order again just because of the service from their driver. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So excited to hear that this Michael's is soon to be renovated!! \n\nThis place is pretty much a clutter of old, out of date supplies that are usually not in the right place and nearly destroyed. I find it incredibly difficult to find anything here, and if I do, it usually has something wrong with it. \n\nI love Michael's as a concept, and I grew up coming to this place with my mother so we could do various arts and crafts for fun. Hell, I still come as a grown up so I can do arts and crafts for fun! \n\nI am looking forward to reviewing this Michael's once the remodel is finished, as I am sure it will turn out to be a much better store! Good luck with the reno! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was a beautiful day in Pittsburgh today - I had to get outside for a walk in the sunshine.  I thought I'd just wander around for Thai lunch and so I ended up at Lemon Grass.  I'll probably not be back.\n\nThere was just one table of 2 seated and eating when I arrived.  And, a table of 10 leaving and all paying separately.  All using a credit card.  I forgot to mention that the one waitress working is also the cashier.  So, it took quite a while to process this table's payments individually by card.  In moments like these, it's best to just get the one check for the whole table and take the 18% auto gratuity as a courtesy to the server.  (Sorry for the rant there...)\n\nAll that said, the huge table of 10 had left.  I was dining alone and there was just the other table of 2 in the restaurant.  I thought I would be able to get in and get out for lunch.  But, no such luck.  It took a while for the server to take my order.  The food came out quickly enough.  But it was quite underwhelming.  I settled with the Thai Fried Rice with beef.  There was a ton of Thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming.  I couldn't be sure if the basil was fresh which may be why the dish tasted a bit rancid to me.  My entree also came with a choice of soup and a small vegetarian egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  The soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour.\n\nI was a bit surprised considering that there were a whopping 3 diners in the restaurant that it took a while for the check to arrive and to get drink refills.  I had high hopes for this place but the food and service was just so disappointing.  The hunt continues for decent Asian food near my office in the Allegheny Center... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went here for breakfast with my wife in December 2009\n\nFirst off, the waiter we had was friendly and accomodating, and the menu has all the standard fare for a breakfast restaurant.   But, some of the other wait staff should have been fired for their unprofessional loud gossiping just 5 feet from the nearest customers table.\n\nDecor- very country and kitch.\n\nPrice - If you don't get the specials then the menu gets pricey quite fast.\n\nFood Quality -  the quality of the ingredients they use is noticeably lower than typical restaurant quality fare. The only flavor in the sausage was pepper, the eggs are so so and coffee gave me heart burn. The other thing to add is that the water they bring to the table is not reverse osmosis treated water like in most restaurants, it is the standard foul tap water of the neighborhood.\n\nAll in all, I won't come back here.  Right after leaving, we went to AJ's next door where they were cooking their weekend omelettes with Gourmet coffee. Next time we'll just go to AJ's instead and be happier.  But at least the company I had that day was awesome! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I went here last weekend, it was really good.  We were just going to sit at the bar and have a drink but someone ordered pizza next to us and it looked awesome.  We ordered a pizza and new people sitting next to us started asking us about the pizza.  The food was good, the bar tenders were nice and the beer was good.  We will be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The entire experience was exceptional.  I travel a lot for work and try new places and gamble on a great experience. Let me tell you, this place was a winner.  The host was awesome from when I walked in, the service was awesome.  Not to mention the food, it was perfect.  I tried a variety of appetizers, the lasagna OMG delicious! And ravioli is to die for.... Dessert was great and had a surprise from our server, a flaming shot a some Dort of liquor with coffee beans inside.  A truly great experience, this is my first review but every time I get to Phoenix this is my first choice for dinner always.  Love this place <|endoftext|>

I am now a big fan. \n\nAshley did a great job on my hair and I am very happy with the result. On top of that she is actually happy to be working here and her positive attitude carriers over into her customer's experience. If you are tired of over paying for your haircut give this place a try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Was at the Rhythm Room again for the Quasi / Sebadoh show and it's great to see the demographics change.  I am so glad this show was an over 21 only crowd, we didn't have to deal with cattle guards and an awful corral system that just makes getting around about 13% more difficult (the Sea Wolf show was all ages).\n\nAwesome place still to see great bands pass through, Savoy Brown is playing there soon and I am sure the demographics will change once again,.  If you are a people watcher check it out, if you are into a diverse range of music and willing to see some indie awesomeness most definitely check this place out. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When you walk in the room there would be little doubt that this IS a motel, but with better-than-average decor. The bed, bathroom and all other stuff are pretty modern but the room itself is small and feels cheap. \n\nDidn't like the air conditioning. It is very powerful but at the same time noisy as heck. If you don't own a pair of ear plugs, you'd better be a deep sleeper. \n\nThe breakfast is amazing. Very delicious and a lot of variety to offer. Couldn't have enough of it. \n\nToo bad we missed social hour where free drinks are provided for everyone. \n\nOverall I'd recommended this place if you are traveling with a budget but still wanna a little spoil during your stay. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Factoring in what I originally stated about the tea that expired a year ago, all the teas I bought ALSO tasted OLD! :( I am thinking they don't have good turnover. The Golden Moon tea doesn't taste like anything I bought from Golden Moon. I am thinking some of those teas have been on the shelf a long time. If you are in a pinch for some teas, this place will do. \n\nBut if you love quality and freshness, AVOID! Also, you aren't suppose to keep tea in clear containers, tea is light sensitive. The teas I bought from the jar taste stale and bad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The room was clean, and attractive. The person at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. They have a service where they will take Hertz car rentals back for you, which was very convenient. \n\nI am giving this hotel two stars though because they charge $10 per day for WiFi, which is a disgrace! Last night I stayed in a La Quinta Inn, which cost one third as much as this Hilton does, and they knew that WiFi is supposed to be included in the room charge, the same way that a TV connection and running water are included in the room cost. Hilton needs to get its act together; because this is pathetic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wanted to write this review, as a what not to do if you own or run a restaurant.\n\nMy wife and I had lunch at Saba's , the service was very good and the waitress was polite and attentive. The food on the other hand ...  \n\nTo start we ordered the Hums and the Baba-ghanoush, this appetizer came out on white plate looking like baby vomit, the Humus was fine, runny and not any better than store bought, the Baba-ghanoush was sour and tasted past it expire date.\n\nNext we ordered two Gyro sandwiches with French fries, the Gyro was only 8 thin strips of meat on a soggy pita, 5 out of 10. \n\nnext is where the fun began. we went to pay our check, and we where asked the typical \"" How was everything\""  ? we at first said \""fine\"". \n\nOwners, \""fine\"" this is the nice way customer say \"" nothing special\"" . \n\nAs we where asked the question, my wife mentioned that the Baba-ghanoush was sour just so the manager or owner that was taking our money would know and maybe go and check on the batch. \nWhat we got was excuse after excuse on why it was not maybe good, everything from we do not have a recipe \"" we just taste it\"" to there is a new guy working. \n\nAt no point did she take it off the bill or look like she was going to do anything at all but take our money and tell us to have a nice day. \n\nIf you do not care about your customers comments just  \""Do not Ask\"" but when you do ask do something about it !!!.  \n\nNeedless to say we will not be returning.  \n\nManagement or ownership does not care one bit about the food it is serving !! \n\nThis always make me think  ..  do they care about the sanitary conditions in the restaurant?  do they care about the cleanliness ? or is it just too many years doing the same thing, \""restaurant burnout\"".  \n\nIf it was the owner shame on her, if it was management, ownership should know and make the necessary changes.  \n\nNever the less the saying goes, one unhappy customer will tell 10 more people abut the bad experience, and this is exactly what I will do. \n\nRichard <|endoftext|>

There is really no space like it in Pittsburgh. \n\nIt sits on this little hill in the heart of Pittsburgh, the corner of Liberty and Grant. The giant rotunda is just magical and the grand hall is beautiful. There are offices in the back - which is annoying because the offices windows surround the grand hall. \n\nDownsides. Of all the venues I visited the staff was the most rigid - there are a ton of rules, no drapery (aka the office windows never go away), liability insurance, music off by 1130. \n\nNeedless to say I booked my reception there - I can work around the rules. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This restaurant is dam costly and is not at all worth for the food they serve. I am Vegan and Paid $13.2 for just 3 types of sides and naan bread and custard. Food was ot worth more than $6 however we were shocked to see their heavy check. Food is not so tasty to admire. It doesnt have the true authentic Indian food taste. They make sides of potatoes and green peas which are cheap in market to keep their profit margin high. They are smart enough to rob people. Please try other Indian restaurant who give you many option to eat for less than $10. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  \""Experienced better\"" per the two stars? Not really. They're all the same. This was my second time here. Second time after my other engine oil changer shop annoyed me for the last time, but that's another review. First time here was OK-good. This time? Wasn't impressed. Irritated actually. Why do all these automobile engine oil changeries want to sell me on the power steering fluid flush? Or the fuel system cleaner? Or the fuel system additive (\""improves fuel economy by 20%\"" whoaaaa)? Or a new air filter. The only thing they didn't want to do was flush my brake fluid. Guess it was OK? They drained the engine oil then brought me in and proceeded to walk me through 200 services they could perform. Everything for $460. All of this after I said the engine oil change was all that was necessary. The guy really didn't care and continued to read off the \""sales\"" screen. At one point I just about got into an argument with him when he started talking about change intervals. I \""learned\"" that the recommended change interval was 3000 miles (\""we don't go by months any more\"" noted!) if you drive in X conditions (stop & go traffic, cold starts, drag racing, etc.). Otherwise it was 7500 miles. Perfect. He then asked if I wanted to go with 3000 miles, 7500 miles or my own decision. Huh? I'm going to get my vehicle's oil changed whenever the hell I want, aren't I? I didn't understand why he was asking that or the reason. He couldn't explain why he was asking the question either. We went round and round for a few seconds then I just said 5000 miles and he entered it in the computer. After that he walked through the remaining 100 services they offered and then showed me my air filter. Apparently, with the amount of dust that is in there, my air filter is reducing my gas mileage by 1-2%. Who knew? All I know is a dirty filter is more affective at trapping particles than a clean filter. I passed on the filter change and all the services, paid the $46 and was on my way. He was kind enough to introduce me to his manager and walk me to my car. That was a little awkward though. And, I saw them do it to everyone before me, so I wasn't special. After I got in my vehicle I noticed the next change interval was 3000 miles from now...why did I tell him 5000 miles again?\n\nWhere am I going with this? I know what I want and I need. If I claim I know and I don't, then it is on me. If I tell you I only want an engine oil change then that is all I want. Simple as that.\n\nNot sure if I'll go back here. But then again, if I go to another place it'll be the same thing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The problem with this Safeway is there are only a total of 7 cash registers for the entire store. They are obviously more concerned with stocking shelves than getting customers through the line.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am always leery of restaurants that display 20 year old accolades and newspaper articles.  This is what I was greeted with after being seated.\n\nWith the temporary closure of Beatties Ford, it is more difficult to get from work to Lancasters for the Friday lunch special.  So, today, we used the closure as an excuse to try this place.  Yes, I am going to make a direct comparison between these two establishments.\n\n1.  BBQ Plate lunch special for $12.98?  Compare this to the $9 Friday special at Lancasters and my wallet knows where to go.  AND I got less food?  AND I didn't have as many side choices?\n\n2.  It smells like an elderly persons home.\n\n3.  No bacon in the green beans?  Is this even legal?\n\n4.  I saw nor tasted any sign of smoke in the meat.\n\nI left, unimpressed, and feeling like I paid too much for the meal.  Not a good feeling.  I think the Cookout across the street has better BBQ for less than half the price, and then I can afford a fancy milkshake.\n\nFirst impression blah blah blah.....I'm doubtful that I'll go back.  I'll be sure to take the detour and go to Lancasters next Friday. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had high expectations for this place, given that it came highly recommended by 2 work associates. Service was quick and attentive....even though I was the first to order and had to wait about 5 extra minutes AFTER everyone else got their order.....Strike 1.\n\nI got the Malay Sauce dish with chicken and shrimp. They give you LOTS of fried rice (or any rice you order) which makes the plate look deceivingly large, but in reality it is NOT that big of a portion....whic is OK for lunch. But the chicken and shrimp portions were unusually SMALL (i.e., not that much of it) and they were definitely skimpy on the Malay Sauce. Strike 2.\n\nThe flavors were.....somewhat BLAND. Not bad, but compared to something like Hasaki Grill, they just cannot compete. Strike 3.\n\nNot horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112, Hasaki, Enzo, etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This food is legit. I have always ordered delivery from here. I usually never have anything to complain about  because Rainbow Garden is great. BUT, their owners/managers are always so angry for some reason. This is not the way to handle customer service, people! You can't yell at someone if they don't like the food they ordered! On the plus side of that situation, they gave me something else w/o charge. \n\nBraised chicken/shrimp/whateverelse protein is always good. Same with the lo mein ..I've had way more things there but I can't remember but it's great. Try anything. But the weird tofu thing it tastes like hard compressed dough that was uncooked and super dry ... <|endoftext|>

I attended the Yelp event here last spring and it was simply magical. \n\nIt is a wonderful venue for evening events and I am sorely disappointed that I was unable to go to Las Noches de las Luminarias this year because I heard it was simply amazing. I bought tickets and it got canceled due to rain. Yes, this does happen occasionally in Phoenix....like once a year, guess it was my lucky day. \n\nI am looking forward to the next exhibit/event that I get to go to here, it is a true gem in Phoenix. And if all else fails, I will definitely be at the butterfly event this spring and at the Luminarias next winter. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This resort is just as nice as the Four Seasons.  I really like the service.  People are attentive and friendly.  It's a historic hotel, so it has history to it.  T.Cook's is DELICIOUS.  Last night, they had a chef's tasting menu that included a dish he created on Iron Chef.  My mom had that dish.  What really stood out was my breakfast this morning.  I'm not a breakfast person at all; however, my french toast with homemade chicken sausage was excellent.  The rooms are beautiful and clean.  It is still kind of dark with all the lights on; however, just step outside during the summer and you'll get enough light.\n\nThe pool is small and not as nice as some other hotels I've stayed at, but that didn't bother me because as long as my toddler had a good time in there - that's all that matters to me.\n\nI definitely will come back next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The cornbread was good but everything was without season and it was fruit Flys (along with the traps) everywhere! The collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes. I would not recommend this to anyone if you are in the mood for good food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband took me to Marcellino Ristorante for our wedding anniversary.  I was impressed how nice the restaurant looked, it was very pretty.  We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and seated at a nice table.  Our waitress, Vita, was perfect example of what all wait staff should model themselves after.  She was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu and was very energetic and enthusiastic.  If the owners of Marcellino read this, all I can say is, \""NEVER LET HER GO!\""  OK with that being said, we ordered the mussels appetizer and the pesto scallop appetizer.  They were good.  The mussels were on the large size and a little tough, but all and all they were good.  The scallops were luke warm in the middle, but still not too cold to eat.  I expected more out of the pesto, it was a little flat on flavor.  They also served us some nice bread with a little red dipping sauce.  It was a nice departure for balsamic and olive oil.  It went well with our wine.\nMoving on to the entr\u00e9e, we ordered one of the specials to share, the Fettuccine Santa Lucia.  Fresh made pasta Infused with the ink from the cuttle fish.  It came in a spicy red sauce saut\u00e9ed with mussels, clams, and calamari.  They state that it is served with  1/2 of a 1  1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster in shell, but the waitress said they would remove it from the shell for us.  So I was on board with that!  The entr\u00e9e was very good, again the mussels were on the tough side but the clams were perfect.  The lobster was sadly overcooked.  The pasta was nice.  We did enjoy that part, but I wish we would have ordered the Tortelloni that was stuffed with Filet mignon and saut\u00e9ed vegetables.  I think maybe it is not a good time for mussels right now and possibly a vendor/supplier issue?  I had a bad experience with them at a different establishment last week, but that is a different review.  We were so full, we couldn't even think about dessert!  I am sure they were awesome.  We finished out our meal by sipping on limoncello.  Very nice.  This was an enjoyable experience and we will go back.  I have to try that Tortelloni! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Hubbard Family Swim School! We started with our daughter in their free, baby splash class at 3 months old. The free class is available to babies 6 months & under is great for getting your child acclimated to & comfortable in the swimming pool. Our daughter is now almost 20 months old & just moved into the Lil Snappers Advanced class. She can climb out of the pool on her own, jump into the water without fear on her own, hold her breath & swim with minimal assistance for 5-6 seconds, blow bubbles in the water, reach down in the water to pick up objects 1.5 feet below the surface of the water, etc. It's absolutely amazing. I'm very pleased! Thus far, I can recommend Katie, Lana, Ed, & Vanessa for instructors. They are knowledgeable, great with kids, & enjoy what they do. I highly recommend Hubbard. The only thing I would change is add some additional change-after-swim rooms! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am between 3 and 4 stars here actually.  Every time I come to this location, they don't have the items stocked in the store that are in the advertisement.  I do love the coupons though and I like that I can find killer deals on shampoo and conditioner. \n\nIt's fun to just peruse the isles and see what they have.  The staff is usually pretty friendly but then they tell me EVERY single time I pay at the register, \""You are approved for 2 free issues of Instyle, would you like me to have those delivered to your home?\""--- Approved?  I guess it's a good marketing thing that works for them b/c they have been asking this for over a year now I think.  I actually get to tell the truth and say, \""I already have a subscription, but thanks!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> RJ's surprised me when we walked in! I was expecting it to be far more of a dive! It's actually quite nice with tables, a bar, and a back area with games and sometimes live music. It's pretty loud at times, and nothing really fancy about the big open room. They only had wine one of four times we were here, but I guess that's to be expected. I figure they could at least keep some of those tiny screw cap bottles for when people request. I settle for beer, which is averagely priced. The service is friendly enough and pretty fast considering the bartender always seems to be the server for the entire place. The food here is surprisingly really good! I get grilled cheese, which honestly is one of the best in the Valley. All of the food looks good. It's cheap in price and comes in a basket. \nRJ's is a fine little stop in. I upped the rating due to the food. No patio here... Just a back door with 2 broken plastic chairs and a dumpster. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. \nTheir appetizers are great, their entrees are great, and their chocolate chip cookies are to DIE for.\n\nYes it is a small place, but we call that atmosphere! <|endoftext|>

Each dinner came with rice and your choice of Black Beans or Pinto beans. We both choose Black beans has iron and protein.  Both meals came with chips and y9ou can choose from 6 different salsas.  Everything was really good and as the name promises ,Fresh!   Very good andHuge amount of food. We will be back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Walgreen's=crap.  This particular location has me convinced to avoid Walgreen's altogether for matters of convenience.  Poor service in the pharmacy is common.  This is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business.  Pharmacists here=decent people.  The pharmacy techs=overpaid, spoiled pains-in-the-asses.  They consistently act as if they're doing you a favor by filling your prescription for you.  The vagrants here are also a problem  Just drive to new CVS down the street or wait until real stores are open for convenience purposes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is a run down dump. I felt like l was going to get a mersa infection just sitting at the table. The food is terrible, even for lndian food. The buffet is over priced. There are some great Indian places in Phoenix and this is not one. You can just tell that they do things as cheap as possible and don't care about quality. My guess is that the chef is mexican and not lndian! Move along. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Still love Carmon's!  In response to other reviews - I only go when I want to enjoy an evening, not a fast food experience.  The relaxed pace at Carmon's is probably the most French thing about the place.  That, and the buckwheat crepes remind me of my happiest afternoons in the Latin Quarter studying in Paris.  \n\nWhile I still order the steak frites, I have also branched out to quiches and desserts.  Delish!  Love how they keep in interesting.  Can't wait to go back. <|endoftext|>

Everything is great.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is huge, I feel like I'm at some kind of mall or something. It's by far the nicest and newest looking airport I've been to. Didn't mind being stuck in this nice airport for an hour or so. Got a little treat at Pinkberry and walked around. There are plenty of shops and restaurants and I never had a problem with finding anything or getting to or on my plane. Oh, and very clean! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is alright. The staff is friendly. It's nothing special, but then again it's a buffet. The food just wasn't that good. The salad bar toppings were fresh, but the lettuce / spring mix was very wilted. The pizza, mac n cheese, and tacos were horrible. It just tasted really cheap. Not that I expect the world from a buffet, but anything you could've made out of box at home would taste significantly better. The ice cream (or frozen yogurt) machine was out of service. That happens anywhere from time to time, so not really discounting the rating for that. On a bright note the strawberry short-cake was awesome, and the staff was very fast to clear the tables. All in all, I am sure I won't come back here for a long time. It's a great deal, but the compromise on the food wasn't at all worth it. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  hmmm, never knew that TGIF's was less expensive than Applebees as the quality of food is much nicer at TGIF's. yesterday me and my girls went to happy hour at Applebees in hopes of finding some good inexpensive appetizers to go with some tasty cocktails. our visit was on to a great start, as our server took care of us like we were in a 5 star restaurant. he was so awesome; he should have been in a tux and bow tie. \n\nthe cost for our drinks and food totaled $41.00 for 3 apps and 7 drinks which isn't bad for happy hour, but a few weeks ago we went to TGIF's for happy hour and ended up with 4 apps, and 2 rounds of specialty cocktails for 3 of us and the bill was under $30. all the appetizers were served at half mass, or at least half the portion served by TGIF's. the potato skins were so greasy not even the sour cream could make it go down smoothly. i did enjoy the spinach and artichoke dip, but the greasy chips were a little too much. kinda funny that the buffalo wings weren't greasy at all. my fav's were the spinach dip and the wings. the spinach dip was served in a kettle pan and there were big chunks of artichoke in it. the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking.  i'll give them another try, but next time it's only wings for me! <|endoftext|>

The staff was super nice, the car service was prompt, our room was nice and the location is great.  My only complaint was the A/C in our room was acting really wacky and not coming on and the drinks at the bar (which the patio is a great area outside to relax) were kinda pricey. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.\n\nThey also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. \n\nI brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.\n\nThey also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food was ok, but the atmosphere and service was less than stellar. The median age of the diners, at 8pm no less, was about 60. The waiter left us alone after bringing drinks taking our order for what seemed like 30 minutes, before telling me that what i ordered was 86ed. That was all fine and good, but when i re-ordered the turkey sandwich, that's not what brought me. It was a chicken sandwich and was missing it's main condiment to boot. I got a side of whatever was supposed to go on it, but I didn't realize the it was chicken instead of turkey until later, and by then, it was so late and everyone else was practically done eating, so i let it go. Overall, the food wasn't anything special and the service is definitely under-par <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.\n\n* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.\n\n* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.\n\n* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.\n\nGuess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am a sushi lover and this place does it just right! \nNot only are they extremely affordable but the happy hour is phenomenal! From 4-6 and 8:30-close their sushi rolls are about 2 bucks and saki bombers (ichiban beer and warm saki) for only 5 bucks! \n\nThe cherry on top is definitely their A+ customer service. They are always friendly whether you are dining in or just taking out. \n\nI recommend this place as the #1 Japanese restaurant in Phoenix! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For me, the best thing about the Armadillo Grill was the waitress.  Fast, attentive, very good interaction with multiple (and difficult) personalities, and knowledgeable of the product.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, the person I was with swears by their spicy chicken wings.  I'm a big boy and I enjoy having more than a little bite into a wing only to encounter bone on the next nibble, so ... pass for me.  I had the veggie burger, which I would best describe as falafel on a bun.  If you like falafel, you'll like this.  The salad dressing (blue) was weak and the salad itself nothing special.  Likewise, the iced tea was watery.  \n\nI was also surprised how warm it was in the restaurant.  Plenty of fans going, but it felt really stuffy  (ironically, when we left later, it felt cooler outside on the wrap-around patio with misters than it did inside.  \n\nMy friend took me here so we could talk about some private issues he was having.  Why he chose this place -- outside of the fact he's a wing fanatic -- is beyond me.  It is a sports bar and this was evident even at 3pm, when you would think most people would be at work.  To say the noise level was a bit loud is like saying Liberace was slightly flaming.  There were no games on, that I could see, but by the shouts and testosterone-fueled \""yeahs\"" you heard every 2 minutes, you would think the Superbowl was moved to a Thursday.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while fans of this place will no doubt have many unflattering comments to throw at me -- most regarding my obvious lack of masculinity -- I can only say that this would be the place to go if you're seriously into sports bars or just can't live without their wings.\n\nAs for me, I'll take my obviously nelly self to a real place where I can enjoy my food and conversation in peace. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My contractor was illegally detained at this location this week.  An overly enthusiastic plain clothes (cop?) with a picture of a badge on his cell phone accused my contractor, and friend of theft (and later changed his tune to say fraud).  With a receipt in his pocket for the roofing materials that he 'stole' that this private dick refused to look at aggressively cuffed him and shoved him around to the back room and interrogated him for well over an hour before Phx Police came on site.  His shoulder was hurt, the cuffs were on so tight circulation was lost in his hands, and all the while a full paid receipt for all the goods was in his pocket.  Right before the police arrived he finally looked at the receipt and said \""Its from yesterday you thief!!  You lying thief!!\""  This date on the receipt was Sept 5 2013.  Guess what day it was....Sept 5.  Now, the rentacop changes his tune and said \"" I never said you stole, you are committing fraud\""  Once Phx PD was on site, they quickly realized that there was no crime, no theft, no fraud and demanded my contractor be released, which he was.  But he continued to be harassed and threatened by this guy.  they also tried to keep my roofing materials, which the PD wouldnt let them do.  \nI just bought a house down the street.  I am remodeling it starting with the roof, then the paint, then the flooring, then the bathrooms.  I was set to spend 30-40k at this store in the next 3mos.  now, that money is going to Lowes on FLW down the street.  They screwed up bad.  I have also offered the services of my (very good) attorney to my contractor, and that ball has started to roll.  This went well beyond normal detainment/suspicion and civil action will be prompt. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just moved to Pittsburgh a week ago and I needed a place to get a few platinum pieces weaved into my more honey-blondish locks.  I know a fair amount about hair, and could have done it myself, but I love the ritual of going to a salon and having 'a girl.'  Dean's was basically the only place I could get an appointment same-day that looked halfway decent.  \n\nI had a Level III stylist who was nice enough, but certainly not a conversationalist.  I don't think English was her first language.  That's no big deal, but a little good cheer would have made it less boring.  Also, I love (LOVE) my former stylist in Michigan so I have high expectations for fun at the salon.  I had no fun at this salon.\n\nDean's is kind of a mid-range pricing scheme.  Not too bad.  I paid $60 for a partial.  \n\nThe concept of the salon is very bland--nothing remotely original about the place.  Judging from the name, I thought it'd be kind of funky (I was thinking Dean of Shadyside as in academic dean and thought it might have a bookish vibe).  They had one interesting product line I'd never seen before, but I can't recall the name.  \n\nI think I'll find a place that's a little more... me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Took my car there on a Saturday because my regular mechanic was closed. While they were able to fix my car fairly quickly, less than a week later the problem reoccurred.

Never coming back, will take to another mechanic down the road for emergencies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is large and in charge and we were not prepared for the multilevel activity overload. My toddler nephew, on the other hand, went full speed ahead and had a blast. He especially loved the water exhibit area with all the splashing and running water features. As an adult, there are some great and interesting exhibits which makes spending the afternoon there worthwhile. Good place to check out at least once but their exhibits are ever-changing so return trips are more than possible. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst diner ever! The food is subpar, my wife got a blt and the lettuce was literally rotten, not a little discolored but ROTTEN! I ordered coffee and I dunno I expect my coffee at the beginning of the meal, the waitress didn't bother to bring it until she brought the food. Tried to her flag down for a refill I must have been invisible because she was ignoring us like a french waiter. So I had to go inside and get my own coffee. Dont waste your time at this shithole, they stay open on name recognition alone. I know many people will say best malts ever, good food but I will venture to say they are wrapped up in the nostalgia. Waste of money, waste of time, waste of space. Burn it down and build a parking lot, or a dennys at least I could get a cup of coffee. I will not go back, ever. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love the sandwiches!  The bread is really what makes these things.  Grab an old school coca cola next door at the coffee shop (the kind made with real sugar cane).  Soppressata sandwich and coca-cola=killer lunch combo. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  \n\nTry DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things\n1. ESPN\n2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff\n3. beer specials\n4. big screen TVs.\n\nWell Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name \""ropa\"", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was \""juicey\"", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess \""juice\"" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of \""rope\"".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  \n\nSorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.\n\nMaybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.  \n\nI only tried this Ropa, and it is not good enough to make me wanna give this restaurant another change at my own cost.   The waitress was very nice and attentive though, I have no complaints about her service, but she did not offer me a substitute.  I would have given it a one star, but she was a friendly and attentive waitress. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was recommended by my Dr. here. I waited 3 weeks for my appointment because of The paperwork for first Appointment. I get to my Appointment and they tell me a different time \""we would have to re-schedule\"" If it were't for the other assistant she wouldn't have even asked the Dr. To try to see me. She was very rude and acted very immature. I wish I would have gotten names, I'm 22 and really the ladies there are much more immature than me.. Except for one.. I wish I had her name.. Keep it up.. For the rest, you need new staff.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service. \n\nI called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said \""Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?\"" No, you can't. \n\nDefinitely won't be going back to this location. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been here a few times before the Diner, Drive-ins and Dives over the yeart. The only item I have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich. I was there recently and had the meatball sandwich which I had such fond memories of enjoying and it was okay. So, if I am in the area, I will give it another try.\n\nAnd one more thing, the Guiseppe's on Scottsdale Rd did have better meat ball sandwiches. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had a little extra time before a Diamond Backs game and decided to stop in here for a couple beers.  The guy behind the bar was a total D-bag.  We ordered 2 pints and he didnt even fill our glasses up all the way.  After the game we stopped again, same thing.  Then we ordered 2 Jager bombs.  Instead of having separate glasses for the shot and red bull, he mixed them.  And he knew that wasn't the way youre supposed to make it because he made a comment about it.  The guy made several rude comments and seemed to be trying to get us out of there...and it's only 8:45. For the prices they charge here, i want my shots made the right way, my beer filled up and with a little less douchebaggery!  Only reason they get 2 stars is for the extremely convenient location and 3 flat screens in the bar area. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I probably step foot into a bank three times per year. Seriously....I'm more of an ATM kind of girl. So, it makes me all giddy inside to report that this Bank of America is not only clean and sparkly, but it's filled with really nice tellers, efficient services and a notary. Woot.\n\nI rolled up to this BoA to grab some cash (many ATMs outside and drive through, folks) and more importantly, to acquire a certified check. These are the errands that I truly despise, because past experience has shown that certified checks can be obnoxious and take a while. Plus, I also needed a notary. Another potentially laborious process. But guess what? The very nice teller took care of my certified check in 5 minutes and directed me to their notary just a moment later. And the icing on the cake? The notary service was free. Yeah - I should have known beforehand that banks provide their customers with free notary services, but, frankly, I never really thought about it. \n\nWhile I'll continue to be an ATM kinda gal, it's nice to know that folks inside this bank are getting the job done. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am baffled that this place is still in business and has a packed parking lot at night. It's dying for Chef Ramsey to come in and do a turnaround on it. It's textbook \""We've lost the love of cooking\"" and now takes the easy way out and used canned everything. Even the \""world famous pies\"" are frozen perfectly round manufactured pizzas with congealed cheese in one gross layer and no flavor. It's like a mini-frisbee with a little cheap pizza sauce and gross elementary school cheese. I ate one of the 8 slices of the pizza and called it quits.\n\nThe lunch side salad came in a little bowl with iceberg lettuce and an INCH of Italian dressing. Yes, an inch. It was ridiculous.  The lasagna and spaghetti is very generic.  The only thing I can say anything positive about (besides the awesome kitschy interior is the seafood dish with bechamel sauce, but you can only get it once every 2 years for fear of heart attack because it's so rich.  \n\nI'm sounding hateful, not because I want them to go away, which I don't but because I want them to reinvigorate their menu to be authentic Italian (or heck, even Greek since they're greek!) I love the place, but it's not enough to get me to eat the food, so that says a lot. I wanted to be a regular, but I just can't stomach it. I might phone up Gordon to save them from themselves... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is great. It is set up in a little house with a really cute atmosphere. They have a great patio and a fantastic personality. \n\nI was there for lunch and had a tuna melt. It was good, but the side of mac and cheese was the best!!! I want to go back and try some of their crab cakes/crab dip (they tout their crab here as being the best around), and of course a side of mac and cheese. The seating is a bit close together and the prices are a little high, but it is great for an occasional lunch or special occasion. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to a strip club in Mexico once and had a memorable experience. One that I've tried to replicate for many years after.\n\nThe stripper, who was very cute and also very proud of her lactating skills, would for all of a buck hastily whip out one of her tits on demand, squeeze it, and shoot a stream of milk at you. \nShe reminded me of drunk me, peeing in a parking lot someplace...waving my stream around until I've spelled out my name.  \n\nPeople...now that's entertainment!\n\nAs compared with the Candy Store, where some dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers stripper who's all too willing to spend a few thousand bucks on breast implants while badly in need of dental implants, snubs you because the black-light illumination is prominently displaying  the pee stain on your cargo shorts. \n\nThe Candy Store.\nNice boobs.\nBad grilles.\nAnd girls with no fundamental lactating / squirting abilities, which they should possess since most are single moms. \n\nA disappointment on every level. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I did not know about The Truth Buddhist Society until I saw Connie's review.  As she mentioned, it's a Chinese speaking establishment.  \n\nThey are absolutely not prepared to receive English speakers curious about Buddhism.  I didn't see a single English language book even though they were kind enough to let me look over their library.  And after a minute or two I was shoo'd away.   \n\nBuddha and Dharma are only a breath away.  But in Charlotte, Sangha is hard to find... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What a joke this is a strip club? It's close to the worst strip club I've ever been to. I'm pretty sure I would have had a better time thrown money at hookers for nothing on Van Buern and driving off and watching them fight over the money. The Great Alaskan Bush Company is the only place I'll try or go to next time I'm in the Phx area! This place is way over crowded and I have no Idea why. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off... it was just one of those days and luckily I drove by this place.\n\nDefinitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting. I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too! That was a plus, especially since I wasn't expecting it.\n\nWhen I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me. There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too. I think I spent around ten bucks...not too bad. Also, just a note - they only accept cards with a $15 minimum so if you plan to spend less than that, bring cash! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really love this family-owned/ran business. I've been in Champaign for several years and whenever I need my Chinese food fix, I know exactly where to go.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Restaurant Week, January 2014.  I loved the menu that they posted online.  Me, Sweetie and 2 friends booked a reservation.  I called up and making a reservation was a snap, no problem. \n\nI have been to Upstream 2 times B.Y (Before Yelp), and thought it was just OK so it hasn't been on my radar.  I'm not a huge fan of crowds and Phillips Place is crowded. I was happy that they offered valet parking so I don't have to deal with parking.  \n\nThe menu was a bit confusing to start since it was their full menu with various upcharges for certain items.  Deal is for $30.00 and you could choose an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert.  The waitress was very nice and explained everything and was upfront about the upcharges.  So, for example if you wanted an appetizer of the crab cakes it was an additional $4.00.  I got it now.....\""It's a profit deal\"" (Steve Martin, The Jerk).\n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was served lukewarm, borderline cold.  It wasn't good.  The bowl that they served it in was hotter than the soup.  Me and my friend sent it back and it was returned just as lukewarm so we forged ahead.  It was just OK in my opinion, it didn't have any lobster in it and was creamy enough but I've had better.  Maybe they cheapened it for Restaurant week?\n\nThe Sake Marinated Sea Bass was on my radar from looking online at the menu and in a last minute decision I opted for the flounder.  I'm glad I did.  So, it was flounder, nicely grilled sitting on top of a black truffle risotto.  This was excellent.  The fish was nicely prepared and seasoned.  The risotto would have made Gordon Ramsey proud.  It was probably one of the best risottos I've had, flavorful not watery and the light sauce on top perfectly complimented the fish.  Sweetie opted for the Sea Bass for a $12.00 upcharge.  She didn't think it was all that great and it was drowned in marinade which was a bit gross.  It was flavorful, but frankly a good sea bass should be treated better IMO.\n\nI got the cheesecake for dessert which frankly, wasn't all that great.  It was clumpy and served with some dry granola or something with some golden raisins.  It needed a sauce of some sort.  I decided to save the calories and bring it home for my daughter.....she'll eat anything.  \n\nAll in all, it was worth it to go for the entr\u00e9e.  The goal of Restaurant Week IMO is to expose you inexpensively to places you don't generally go to.  I'm glad I went back and may try Upstream again soon to see if it's worth the trip.  It's been a round for a while and there's probably a good reason. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food is great!! Prompt customer service, a little pushy but they are on it. My glass was never empty and food is prepared perfectly everytime. Never any undercooked mushy rice. The house chicken is crispy and the sauce is not like any other house sauce. The sizzling rice soup is what got me hooked. It's full of flavor, egg drop, pork, shrimp, chicken, water chestnuts, veggies, and the rice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Beware of dirty tricks!\n\nI used to eat here frequently. However, my last two visits were terrible. The restaurant substituted a $14 fish dish for a $26 fish, without informing us. They simply served it. The first time I was not sure. The second time I asked and pointed out that it is a different kind of fish. They said they ran out of the fish I ordered, and reimbursed the price difference. But apparently they would just keep the overcharge if I had acquiesced. \n\nAnd of course I am expected to be happy with a fish I haven't even ordered.\n\nMake sure you're eating THE fish you ordered (not some cheap substitute) if you go to Mandarin Wok. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a real big fan of Old Navy since I guess I grew out of that phase... don't get me wrong they make respectable clothes but there are only so many ringer t-shirts one can wear in a lifetime.\n\nI recommend the clearance rack strategically located in the back of the store sections.  I guess it's pretty smart to put the regular priced stuff in front, but sometimes I feel the clearance prices are just about right for what you are getting.\n\nOther than some novelty items and the occasional good sale, I think I'll stick with my other stores for the time being. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Booked the penthouse for a night on the town, in the town. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by plenty of construction for the new Knight's ballpark, making getting there a challenge. Once we found our way to the entrance, the clerk at the desk decided that the phone call - possibly a personal call, possibly a take-out order - was much more important than our business. Regardless, we eventually made our way to the room, and it was nice in appearance. Not over-the-top or anything, but nice for a Residence Inn, and nice for our night out.\n\nUnfortunately, the thermostat is the \""hotter and colder\"" variety - not much different than the kind that used to be mounted under the window, it's just now on the wall. Is it really that much more to have the kind you set an actual temperature? It means that throughout the night, it gets way too hot, or way too cold, and makes for an uncomfortable night.\n\nThere are two televisions - one in the living area and one in the bedroom. The one in the living area works with the lineup card, while the one in the bedroom has the digital assignments, such as 76-0010 and whatnot, meaning you can't find anything (including HBO), so if you want to actually watch a show, you'll probably end up watching on the hard-as-a-rock sleeper sofa in the living area.\n\nIf you have to flush the toilet (and many people prefer this option), you lose all water in the bathroom. Not most, or even a particular temperature. It's gone. Not forever, so don't be completely alarmed. But for a few seconds, water completely stops. Not sure if this is unique to this room, or to the 11th floor, but it is a bit odd.\n\nThe hot breakfast is, well hot, but the offering wasn't the greatest. In fact, some other quick-serve, business-style hotels offer a better service and they are only deemed \""continental\"". If you go to an Embassy Suites, with their made-to-order breakfasts, it's much, much better.\n\nAll-in-all, we had a passable night, but I'm not sure if I'd stay again. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Cracker Barrel for Sunday morning, on the way out of Champaign food. Great way to end the weekend. All the food is good, esp the hash brown casserole, but we all knew that. \n\nI'm reviewing especially for service. Twice now, we've been with parties of at least 10. This past weekend? 14! Both times, we've been seated without much wait (no wait this past weekend...and who would expect no wait for 14...at a breakfast place...on Sunday), been served quickly, been given separate checks without a second word, and just had a totally painless experience. Orders are all correct, food prepared well for what it is. Good times. This past visit...3 of us went to put names in for everyone, expecting a wait, and they pushed a huge table together, and sat the scouting party, letting them just wait for everyone else to show up. All service I guess I wouldn't expect from a run of the mill, always busy breakfast place. \n\nSo - visit this Cracker Barrel without fear. Order Grandma's French Toast. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok, so i really dont know what the fuss is all about....maybe i just ordered the wrong pizza, my fiance ordered two blue moons and a deep dish pepperoni, sausage,  mushroom and bacon pizza because we heard it's they're deep dish \""SPECIALTY\"" .....uuuuugh it was awful i could barely eat my slice. It was salty and you could barely taste the marinara sauce and it was waaaay waaaay over priced!!! They put a whole sausage patty on bottom and the dough is hard on bottom....disgusting!!! Not only that but our bill was like 60.00 dollars but we also waited about 45 minutes....so the only things that were good were the wings and the blue moon. I should of went to little caesars lol... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hubby loves this place...I however do not really care too much for it. The curries are too sweet and their stirfry's are always packed with too much cabbage! and I mean raw cabbage. I also don't understand how they expect us to eat dry stirfry with rice.  We eat here if hubby has serious thai food hankering and I have decided to stick with their noodles which are actually decent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Easy in and out, love that part! TSA security is the worst. No help, no smiles, to slow, don't care. No preferred line.\n\nGenerally a dirty airport (delta terminal). All the food courts are at one end of the terminal, so you have to walk from one end to the other just to get a cup of coffee or bite to eat!\n\nIt seems that people in this airport have two speeds slow and stop! Very frustrating if your on business, if your on a golf vacation you'd probably love it! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish I could give this place \""-5\"" stars for its terrible food quality. Oily, greasy and bad taste. All 4 members of our party fell sick, throwing up and/or with a running stomach. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I never quite understand why some people look so miserable... especially when one works at a restaurant, where people come and dine for enjoyment.  I haven't been to Thai House in a long time, and this's my 1st visit to this location, and they still manage to have the same unfriendly, slow, unacceptable level of service as they always had (the one at University area) and apparently known for... hmmm, not sure if that's a reputation you want there Thai House.\n\nTo use up a Groupon, we had dinner there last night.  Amidst it's Father's Day, it wasn't really that busy or crowded.  Somehow we still had to sit around for a LONG time before our order was taken... this was after a seemingly non-busy waiter walked by us numerous times and never even turned his head our way AND after a waitress ignored the heck out of my \""excuse me.\""  \n\nFood wise it was ok.  I had the roast duck with pineapple curry sauce while my dinner-mate ordered the Tom Kha (coconut brothy soup) and the beef Pad Krapraw.  The soup was interesting, since coconut tends to be associated with sweet food items; I personally like it, it's not heavy at all.  My roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted.  The meat was a little over-cooked, but the curry sauce was good enough to compensate.  I had half a fork full of the beef Pad Krapraw... can't tell if it was good but this is normally my fav lunch dish (except I think it works better with chicken or pork). \n\nIn all, this is an average meal (food quality wise), but the service was  unbelievably bad.  When the most impressive part of the dinner is the decor (rich & ethnic without the tackiness)... well, enuff said. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the place I come when I crave for an authentic Japanese noodle dish.  Ika mentai pasta I had tasted just like the one I had in Japan. I don't know any other places that serves tarako (cod fish eggs) in Phoenix. \n\nIf this place is closer to my house, I would come here every week!\n\nThey also have a great selection of desert. I tried strawberry short cake. It was so moist and the cream was not too sweet, just right amount of sweetness made it so perfect and I ate all... May be it's a good thing that this place is not too close to my house. I may try their cake too often and I have to watch my girly figure if I do :). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great cupcakes, wonderful staff -- can't go wrong!\n\nAlthough I'm more into European buttercream than the much-sweeter American version (which Barb's uses), this bakery's cupcakes hit the spot.  Everything in the display window looked absolutely delicious, especially the tiramisu (at ~$2.00, too!), but I was in the mood for nothing but cupcakes, and so I ordered all 11 of their flavors, plus a second red velvet to make a dozen.  \n\nThey've got some really tasty, creative flavors going on (especially the cosmo cupcake and ice cream sundae cupcake), and their take on classics are delicious as well (carrot cake!).  The frosting -- although sweeter than what I typically like -- was very good, and they definitely know how to bake their cake.  They seem to have a very nice staff, as well.  When I told the woman behind the counter that I heard online that Barb's was the place to get cupcakes in Phoenix, she simply smiled and replied, \""That's because this IS the place!\""  How did she know that I like my food with a side of swagger?\n\nSimply put, Barb's has got it goin' on, and I'll gladly return next time I'm Phoenix.  Maybe I'll try that tiramisu I was eyeing... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.\n\nIt doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is where Marie Antoinette would eat, were she a contemporary Phoenician and not a deposed French ruler from the eighteen century. Total decadence. Total indulgence. Totally wrong but oh-so-right. \n\nBrunch: cheese plate, eggs Benedict in a spicy hollandaise, Gruet mimosa. \n\nLunch: cheese plate, burger with dry jack cheese and pancetta on ciabatta, sweet potato fries, gin-cucumber martini.\n\nOh my god, the cheese list. I really hope I never become lactose intolerant. Because I don't think it would stop me from devouring cheese plates like they're going out of style, but it would make the aftermath upsetting. Anyway, their list is robust and I've yet to try something I don't like. The Roaring '40s blue is excellent. Idiazabal was like a Spanish manchego, but smokier. The manchego was hard and nutty and delicious. The Chimay Grand Cru made great use of its Belgian beer namesake and was smooth and a bit soft.\n\nWould you think I was weird if I said the Hoch Ybrig tasted like a Swiss mountain meadow? Whatever, it totally did - floral and fresh and pastoral. I bet those cows were eating some sweet clover and spring blossoms. \n\nWine, cheese, bread. It's like a guaranteed homerun in my book. One problem - some of the sloooowest food ever. And not in that this-was-grown-within-a-four-block-radius way, either. Just slow. Like fucking molasses. \n\nOrder-in to food-received: 55 minutes. For three burgers, a macaroni and cheese and a cold turkey sandwich. During a late lunch amongst not more than five other tables. This only makes sense if the kitchen contains a bong. Or maybe a live pig. \n\nDon't think about it, though. Just order another cocktail, consume your weight in cheese and, if you want to reenact my own experience, drool a little. \n\nAs Marie Antoinette would say (OK, probably not, since this is totally unverified and historically questionable, but fuck you for saying so), \""Let them each cheese!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They aren't great, but they certainly are exceptional. It's just around the corner from where I live so from time to time, usually during football season for mnf, is what I love coming here for if it's just me to lay low and watch the game minus the company you find in a typical sports bar crowd. The food is exceptional and reasonably priced. I'm mostly a beer guy, but here I actually will spring for some wine once in a while. I'm also normally a pizza guy. I mean I really, really like pizza, but here I've gotten pretty much everything else but that, simply because I already know the pizza is good, but so are the other pastas or sandwiches they have, which are slightly cheaper. My favorite so far is their roast beef sandwich. I've always found the waiters to be good and accommodating and I even like the patrons that will come in, which are either families in the dining area or people just sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine while they wait for their take out order. Never found it to be too crowded, or too loud, or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place. Usually during the course of a game I'll order a pasta or sandwich and a couple beers and the bill will be less than $20 so that's pretty good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I took my mom and grandma to the Beach House last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a Papa Murphy's pizza. There weren't many patrons in the dining room. Our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food. I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food. She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before. The waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something. Needless to say, I will not be returning. On a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> this was a nice find. my usual nursery was out of thuricide, a chemical i desperately needed to thwart the skeletonizers ravaging my beautiful grapes. \n\nthe place is well laid out, but felt a bit over my comfort zone....much like that fancy gym on camelback.....\n\ni don't know if their prices overall are more expensive given their location,  but the staff was extremely knowledgeable in helping me find what i needed. i have driven by here and noticed their gates are close at 5pm? isn't that when most regular people get off work and need to shop for stuff? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> No really - if this place goes anywhere Phoenix;  AZ for that matter will have lost something monumental.  I am not over exagerrating when I say, at the top of my voice.....THESE ARE THE BEST DAMN DONUTS YOU WILL EVERY EAT.  They are light and big, the long john with the cream down the middle is unlike anything you've tasted.  The cream isn't super disgusting sweet so it goes so well with the chocolate or maple frosting.  It is owned and operated daily by the same people.  You won't see anyone different every time you go there.  I have one drug.  Coffee.  Second drug every 2 months.  Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek and Greenway, not all the same this is the best in the west.  Bar none.  Try it you'll see why.  \n\nTry not to cry when you go there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The quality of the sashimi has been very poor the last few times we visited Shogun. We used to go once  a week but  it is doubtful if we will return anytime soon after three or four disappointing meals. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not clean, room sure could use a coat of paint and updating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A hidden gem with relaxing scenic views, historic homes and plenty of walking trails. I was very surprised with how large an area this park encompasses, and so you would want to be prepared if you plan to visit. Great place for families and couples. Quiet and not over crowded. My husband and I went to this place on Saturday afternoon and we couldn't ask for a better place to unwind from the busy life and connect with nature, one on one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was my official neighborhood coffee shop while I lived right down the road on Walnut for 3 years. It's located right in the heart of Shadyside, and while some of the patrons are typical uppity Shadyside residents, the staff are very laid back and very cool. It's a big venue for a coffee shop, with a down stairs area with beautiful exposed brick and large opening windows that are great in the summer months, and also an upstairs area with many tables, a fireplace with sofas, and even a back private room people can rent out. The coffee and pastries have always been pretty good. One complaint I would have is (I don't know if they still do this) you could only have Wifi access for two hours with the purchase of an item. I understand the need for this, but if you plan to work here for most of the day you have to keep refilling or buying other items on the menu. I usually stop in when I'm shopping around Shadyside and miss it now that I've moved out of the neighborhood.  Also a great place for meeting with friends or a casual date. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tennis sale anyone?! Don's tennis has had a sale every time I've driven by. Located at the intersection of Morehead and McDowell, Don's tennis has everything a tennis fan/player would want. Tennis channel on the small TV all day. Demo racquets available. Every racquet you could want is for sale here, as well as shoes, balls, bags, hoppers, string, grips, etc, etc. Don is there most days and provides some fast talking, but is genuine in his advice and feedback. Usually a full time stinger working too, so getting your racquet re-strung same day usually isn't an issue.\n\nOne point to mention...only cash or check...no plastic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop for almost all my music needs. The review before me I find to be a nervous shopper. The staff watches you to make sure they meet ALL your needs. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. I bought a New Fender Ultimate Chorus Amp, So for him to say what he did about their line is just not true. Yes they do allot of catering to students, it's called Bread and Butter, and I fully understand that. No they can't compete with the large chain stores with allot of the famous brands, But they do carry some. They  will go out of their way to make sure you are a satisfied customer. As for the antique side of the store, I have found many little trinkets of my likening. If you don't go look you wont know it's there. Over all I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My first Jack in the Box East Coast sighting!  I was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl.  That was until I arrived and the menu was completely different than what I had remembered from the California Jack in the Boxes.  If the food was more consistent with the west coast this place would be a 4 star easily.  It is very clean, the staff was very friendly and the food although not being what I wanted or remembered was somewhat tasty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stick to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.  All of the Espresso locations on campus are dirty, usually crowded, and serve consistently burnt tasting drinks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I try to stay fair and reasonably positive on my reviews of restaurants because its hard for me to be that critical of all the great restaurants I've been to.\nHowever, when I go to get my clothes tailored and my shirt I had comes back looking like it belongs on a 12 year old boy, I just can't let that go. I'll be fair and say that the other shirt I had done came out fine. But either way, I'm gonna look around next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the place I imagine sneaking into on an evening spent with that charming someone who captures your heart with the slightest smile. Late spring, strolling along the cobblestone streets window shopping when the sky darkens, and the clouds open up. Huddled under an umbrella, his arm around you to warm you from the sudden chill, you scamper down the few steps and duck into the warmth of Girasole.\n\nYou're immediately greeted like family; with a glow in the background as if a huge fire were burning. The small space is filled with lovely folks laughing, and sharing wine; eyes twinkling as they listen to the live music being played by the gentleman walking around strumming his guitar singing loudly.\n\nThe menu is simply simple Italian. The wine list is the sweet red table wine offered immediately after you sit down. The desserts are so worthy of the extra calories. Home made and delightful. \n\nAlmost as tasty as that good night kiss. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my 2nd review because I love this place sooooooooooo much...Everyone should go here!!! It is one if the best places in phoenix!! The atmosphere is beautiful especially at night! Im so lucky b/c i can just walk here and i do ALL THE TIME!!!  The greatest deal is the board and bottle night on monday and tuesday nights starting at 8 pm...the wine selection is quality...the selection isnt as large but all the wines are fabulous!! You can also buy wine and take it home...the food is just as fabulous...i love the bruschetta prosciutto and fig, brie and apple, ricotta pistachio and date, artichoke spread and the one with tomato bacon and i forgot the cheese...those are the ones i love but i have no doubt the others are great too!! The soups are so warm and delicious i love them on cold dzys and its great if you get a half panini and u can dip your sandwich in it and it makes both the panini and souo that much better...they have paninis for everyone!! The desserts are fabulous my favorite is the salted caramel sundae...i like the caramel ontop of their chocolate cake and ice cream its amazing...of course leave it up to me to love two desserts and combine them...or if you want a good drink other then wine try their bellinis and mimosas...they are delicious at anytime of the day hahaha...just dnt drink too many and drive have someobe get you a cab...\nI love this place so much and cannot tell more ppl enough about this place!!! So come here and enjoy!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good prices and a Pittsburgh Classic. Kolbassi sandwich with Fries? Yum. Spicy rub pickles? Yum. Good beer, too. Nice outside seating but beware the pigeons, sit-down and counter service, <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow... This place is sooo bad.   Lo mein looked good but the box probably had more flavor.  Apparantly 10 packs of duck sauce is all the seasoning this food gets.   Overpriced, very, very bland.  We love Chinese food (especially delivered) but I'm finishing this review on the toilet :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yeeeeaah, I know it's, y'know, power lunch by day and disco by night, but wow was the dinner I had here underwhelming. \n\nLike, boring, oily, scant salad, meh fries, expensive, bland beer selection. Our waitress was gone - either invisible, dropping things loudly and whisking off like she hadn't just startled the beejeezus out of us, or just that warm mix of fed up/bored/seriously, you want something? kind of service that screams for a 5% tip.\n\nSomehow still managed to spend 20 bucks a head. And that'll be the last time I visit Cosmos. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We have been here other times and I don't remember ever having an issue. We stopped here for quick breakfast on the way out of town a few days ago. I did not pay attention to the drive-through but I think it was average busy, there were like 0 to 2 other customers inside at the time...\nWe placed our order, and it kind of took a little while, which I am fine with because I understand sometimes the cashier may be new, or in training... \nHubby had gone to Costco to get gas in the mean time... he came back and we sat to wait (4 people)...\n5 minutes went by... 10 minutes went by... I asked if it was going to take long and someone told me it was because it was a big order... I do not know what the confusion was... We ran out of patience and went to check again... Finally our order was ready and it took over 15 minutes from the time in my receipt... We usually do fast food breakfast when we go out of town and it may take 15 minutes for us to be in and out, ordering, getting our food, AND eating...\n\nOur daughter thought I was making a big deal out of it, but this is called a **fast food** place, and we were in fact in a hurry...\n\nOK, so we left and I gave everyone their meal... only to find out the last one (mine) was not what I ordered... at this time I was not willing to spend much energy on this, so we didn't go back... later in the day I found out my order along with other sandwich was at the bottom of the bag... so they did mess up the order but my food was in there... I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (\n\nBut the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P\nIt bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...\n\nI know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person, but honestly I do not think I am. \nAny of these incidents on its own would have been within my tolerance level... but delay, wrong order, no cinnamon/sugar? that was a little too much for a not so much of a morning person like me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's just plain good!  Whether you like a hot pastrami on rye or a plain ol' turkey sandwich this deli is the real deal!  Large portion sizes, free refills on soda, and the friendliest staff around.  Daily specials are a bargain and my own personal recommendation...the Reuben and the turkey Rachel are out of this world! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was my first time at SP. We waited about 15 min after being seated before someone came to take our order. We were never offered or asked if we wanted anything to drink. We started with pot stickers and egg roles then continued with orange chicken. After ordering, the pots tickers came right out and tasted old and deep fried when the menu said pan fried. Within 2 minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out. It really worries me when food comes out that fast. All the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy.\n\nThe service was not good and no one came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. The waited disappeared and the only reason we got boxes or a check was because the busser  saw me looking around for service. \n\nWe will probably not return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had to find something to do with my time as I anxiously waited for little Leela wonder puppy to reach the 12 weeks of age required before I could bring her home from the breeder. And since I had already purchased basically every product she could ever need or want, I decided to search for the perfect vet. I researched and interviewed quite a few places before settling on Animal Care Hospital. The fact that it is so close to me was definitely a factor, but I was impressed with this office regardless of location. I wanted to make sure the vet I chose would be a good fit for my Yorkshire Terrier, so I had plenty of questions to ask and Dr. Bishop graciously answered them all. \n\nAnimal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. \n\nFor routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \n\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible. When I asked to deviate from the standard puppy vaccination plan and follow the veterinary protocol recommended by my breeder (a yorkie lover with 20 years experience breeding show and pet yorkies), she was accommodating and even excused herself to go print some info to re-familiarize herself with this particular protocol and permanently place it in Leela's file. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.\n\nI had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  Classic exterior and very nice interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas, which would be great for a company function or family dinner.\n\nPersonally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality.  I think their grilled chicken is the best anywhere.  Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price.\n\nDefinitely will be returning to this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We went for the buffet on a Sunday morning, and are so glad we decided to give it a try!  My husband's favorite is Chicken Tikka Massala - which they had on the buffet.  I'm pretty new to Indian food, but there were so many options and so many things I liked!  \n\nThe service was amazing!  Our water glasses were constantly full, which is good considering some of the food is really spicy!  We're not from that area, but if we were in the neighborhood, I would consider going there again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Dropped in for lunch and what a little hidden gem ! Menu outside got our YES to come in .. So many delicious sounding choices was hard to choose from ! Open the door and what cute decor , I was expecting like a taco shop feel or sandwich shop but it's a cute little restaurant hole in the wall place :)  (which I love). We got the fresca pita and world famous with spicy feta fries , so good you just can't stop eating no matter how full you are ! Flavor is good , all the meat is fresh , chicken in mine was all white meat :) no fatty gross pieces . We will def be back ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We decided to visit this place while in the area based on all of the strong reviews from our fellow Yelpers.  We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.\n\nThe place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly. \n\nWe ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.\n\nWhile everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).\n\nAll-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.\n\nI saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.\n\nOh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables. \n\nNot sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  $23.99 I had to finish wiping down the dashboard, cup holders weren't wiped out at all. Floor boards were kinda vacuumed. Rear of SUV wasn't cleaned at all but I was charged extra for the size of my vehicle. :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not sure what's happened to this place but it has gone down hill. We use to drive across town to eat here. We went here for a business lunch and it wasn't that good, service was bad and the food was slopped onto the plates. Sad to see one of my old favs turn into just another crappy Mexican food place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food was excellent, but we were a bit neglected on a slow Saturday night with the service. It might have been no dedicated hostess to greet and more of the attention was on waiting tables outside. There were only three couples inside including us. The food took awhile to come out and wife had sand in her broccoli for her entree. I would come back probably for a lunch instead of dinner to give it another chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  While office staff seem competent and things move along in a timely manner, I do not sense the happiness or joy of the staff working there coming out through their customer service: minimal to no greeting, same at checkout, with frowns among staff. Perhaps they feel worn, competitive, or restricted, but the energy could be more warm, inviting or welcoming. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's been robbed on 2 different occasions while I was shopping there.\n\nI go to the one at Osborn and 7th Ave now.\n\nBetter selection, bigger store, cleaner, safer.\n\nEDIT\n\n+1 STAR\n\nOne redeeming value - Good place to flirt with hipster girls buying hummus or whatever. At least until her girlfriend returns with the chocolate chip cookies and kicks your ass. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I ended the work week on a nice note when I met Donald S and a new friend at Tacos De Juarez for lunch on Friday.  We enjoyed good conversation amidst the early Goodwill high back dining chairs, the Formica tables mixed with the old Ethan Allen desks serving as tables (thanks for that insight Mark) and crowd of diners from a broad swath of life.\n\nThe chips were good, standard stuff.  The red and green salsa was also tasty, although the red is mild bordering on hot and the green is just hot.  I recommend waiting until your drink arrives before starting in on the green salsa.\n\nI wanted 2 enchiladas.  They come with cheese and I wanted one with cheese and one with chicken added.  There was a bit of language difficulty and I ended up with 2 chicken enchiladas.  \n\nBut let me start with the basics because that is where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant begins:  rice and beans.  If they miss on the basic rice and beans then they will have a hard time getting me back.  The rice and beans were good.  Not greasy, not dry.  Great.  On to the enchiladas.\n\nThe chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken.  Good stuff.\n\nI will absolutely add Tacos De Juarez to my list of good & cheap restaurants.  And having been in the El Paso/Juarez area recently I can say that even though the neighborhood immediately surrounding Tacos De Juarez looks a little sketchy it is not.  For example there were no poor souls executed and left hanging from a chain link fence here as there was a couple weeks ago along the border. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I used to live above Empire, so I became very well acquainted with their food. Their food is amazing, best Chinese food I've had hands down. The shrimp in their Shrimp and Broccoli dish was my favorite, most Asian restaurants give you very small low quality shrimps, but Empire's are big jumbo shrimps and are good quality. \n\n After graduating from U of I and leaving the area, I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant like it :/ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  decent bbq (gets waaaay more hype than it deserves really) that is hampered by the fact that i have gotten mediocre-to-bad service every time. i usually stick to only good reviews but this weekend was the last straw.\n\nbrother and i went in saturday 041214 to use a Groupon and it was a hassle- if you don't want to deal with Groupons, you can always, y'know, NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM VOLUNTARILY. then we were told multiple different prices with the excuse 'uh, certain specials aren't allowed to be used'. well a) that isn't noted anywhere b) the items ordered were on the menu, not listed as 'special' c) they told us we had to order the full amount to get the discount, which is not how ANY Groupon deal i have used works (ie, the $20 credit wouldn't kick in until we ordered $20 worth of food. yeah, what? its a $20 credit! if we ordered $18, that means its all covered, not that we need to buy another side we didn't want!)\n\non top of that, we only got half our order at first, my brother went to ask about his and was told he cancelled the other half of the order. the part that was paid for and on the receipt? at this point he was pretty annoyed and the on duty manager came out and was condescending and telling him to calm down. then was told that his order was being made fresh so it was gonna be awhile- only to have it come up right then. this trip didn't make sense and they didn't really seem to care. not really in a rush to go back ever at this point. your bbq is ok, but i can go to Astor House up the street and not deal with this kind of headache.\n\ni am not a bitchy, crabby person, i deal with the public all day and as such try to be understanding when situations come up and things take a while...but this is not an isolated incident and their attitude about it sucks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Surprisingly, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious!\n\nGrilled Chicken Salad - good enough\n\nSpud Max - great! I would definitely get this again.  The Spud Max includes: bacon, cheddar cheese, scallions, and ham.  Add sour cream, and I am in heaven! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We used Horizon for a two part local move (some goods moved into a temporary apartment and most goods stored, then the apartment and stored goods moved to a new home).\n\nThey managed to damage two refrigerators and a dryer and completely ruin a washing machine.  We were eventually compensated for those losses, but we are now (after the deadline for claims is past)  finding hidden damage that was known to the moving crew but hidden from us so that they are just now being found.\n\nNeedless to say, we are disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow what a sloppy car wash.  I got the ultimate because I said I wanted everything done.  Of course I was offered great detailing prices, but passed on that.  The Ultimate honestly isn't worth the $25.  My truck wasn't dry, there still was dirt and bird droppings, and the indoor/outdoor dressing was slopped on.  I have large spots of dressing that wasn't spread evenly and spots with none.  The edges on the windows, mirror, and well any edge is missed completely.  I felt like I should have saved my money, driven thru a cheap car wash and finished it myself.  The only reason I gave it a second star is the stellar pricing and work the window guys did on my multiple chips.\n\nI will not be back to this place.  Not worth the price.  I have had better done cheaper. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always quick & do a great job cleaning & pressing the clothes. Prices are also very reasonable & the people are always nice & very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible customer service; I've been a handful of times and get ignored or feel as though I'm inconveniencing the staff. It's also comparatively overpriced. Go to Rage Bikes in Scottsdale, for the total opposite of my comments above. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  McDonalds is generally McDonalds.  The food here is fine, but service/atmosphere is lacking.  They seem to have some sketchy clientele (almost saw a fight break out here once).  Also, they have very strict BBQ sauce quotas. Unless you buy mcnuggets or chicken selects, they make you pay for any bbq sauce you want ($0.25/pack); I think it's sort of ridiculous  that you can't get free bbq sauce with your chicken sandwich. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've visited this location numerous times. While I understand you need an appointment to get any help at an apple store, this place is always mayhem. The staff member that assigins you an apple member is most likely told to lie to you in order to keep you waiting as long as possible - before you completely lose your patience.\nI got to the store at 10am on the dot expecting to simply buy an iPhone 4 and get on my way. The place wasn't busy at all, and I had no questions. Just charge my card $395 for the phone and mobile me, take my info and i'm gone, right? Not so fast.\nI walked out at 10:45. They said they would help me right away, and I stood waiting 25 minutes until I could be helped. Three times I was told \""someone will be right with you\"". The last guy that helped me was nice ,but that didn't makeup for the experience.\nIt's sad apple is such a profitable business with such awful, understaffed customer service. If there was another option out there that was comparable, it would be a no brainer to switch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nothing was torn or stained, but a lot of the clothes looked worn and a little faded.  And yeah, I get that Plato's Closet sells clothes that HAVE been worn, but they're not supposed to LOOK it.  I'm kind of surprised by the previous reviewer who stated that the clothes are geared toward the 25-34 age bracket.  Um, were we in the same Plato's Closet??  Most of the stuff looked pretty cheap and teenybopperish to me.  I can see going here if you're looking for something disposable for going out on campus, but definitely not to build a professional wardrobe. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has the weirdest fish tacos I've ever had... they were good.\n\nThe grilled cod was ground up and mixed with cilantro and green onions (kind of like taco meat). It was well spiced and pretty good.\n\nOther than that, the most remarkable thing about this place is how long it has survived downtown. It's fine in a pinch, but definitely not a destination. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When I first moved here 15 years ago, this was a great place. It has gone downhill so much that I cannot reccomend it at all. I don't think anyone in the kitchen is Japanese, and the cooks dont know how to prepare basic dishes, such as tempura.  If you order shrimp tempura (hi $$$), you will only get 2 medium size shrimps on your plate. I asked if this was a normal amount to find on the shrimp tempura entree - and was told \""yes only two\"". The fried batter was oily and not crispy as one expects with tempura, and the vegetables inside were mushy and tasteless. Some of the pieces i could not even identify. The miso soup was tasty but room temperature. My chicken katsu was hard and dry, and I had to wait a long time to get a knife to cut it, as we could not find a server to help us. The service was poor. My friend enjoyed his eel sushi, but I did not sample that. I think there must be better Japanese places to eat. The place is often crowded - so I believe many patrons just don't know what good Japanese food should taste like! And the owners probably don't care about the poor quality as long as they get tourists who show up and pay their bill. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very nice dining experience.  We had dinner on a Thursday night and started with the small order of the escargot cassoulet, I don't normally like escargot, but this was amazing and I wished we'd ordered the large.  Then we split a large Waldorf salad, it is made table side and it's a generous portion.  For entree's, I had the veal and crab, which was delicious while my boyfriend had the crispy redfish and he really enjoyed that.  We were too full to order dessert, but they did box up their cotton candy for us to enjoy later as well as two boxes of their delicious fresh baked bread.  We had the garlic focaccia and the chocolate cherry. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visited this Sonic fast food estsblishment last night as the little one wanted a corn dog. Drove through and ordered some selections to take home. Little one took the corn dog out and exclaimed how small it was. In fact he said I hope there is two!  (They were half the size of any corn dog we ever saw!) Little one then started pealing the breading off the corn dog (which he likes to eat last) revealing a very blackened skinney little Weiner about the size of my pointing finger. Cant believe they would serve this burnt shriveled half sized  wenie to anyone. Sonic should be deeply ashamed. I also had some popcorn chicken that was overbreaded and tasteless. Ugh.! If for some reason you like sonic, it must not be for anything we  ordered. My first and last visit for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went in for their fluff and fold service. My schedule has been very hectic so I thought I could rely on them to help me out, especially at over $1.6 per pound of clothes. \n\nI used the fluff and fold service 2 times. The first time, I was missing some pants. They agreed to refund me for the price of the pants in the form of store credit. So that forced me to go there again.\n\nThe second time I used their service, I was returned a bag of clothes that was a mixture of mine and someone else's. I noticed this after I returned home, and promptly went back and returned the clothes that were not mine. I contacted the manager and he said he would have to call corporate about my situation. \n\nA few weeks later, I received a letter and a phone call from corporate. The letter stated that they watched video surveillance and saw the employee correctly separating my clothes from other clothes. The phone call stated that I must have come back and returned my OWN clothes because there is no way they could have messed up. They still refuse to refund me for any of my lost clothes or for their terrible service. \n\nDon't support this business please. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups, and sometimes it's hard to get a server or bartender to notice you (I've never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching \""comfortable\"").  And what about the famed BACON NIGHT?  It's not even good bacon!\n\nThey'll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> open late when i needed them to be open late... caught in a rainstorm (!) with non-functioning windshield wipers, they gave great advice and were helpful for employees talking to a soaking-wet customer so close to closing time. \non one other occasion, i came in to get a 19mm socket for my oil pan. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had the LASIK procedure performed by Dr. Ugland and highly recommend him. He performs LASIK on all of the Carolina Panthers, so if the NFL trusts him... I think you're good! :)\n\nFirst, you go in to see if you qualify. After that, you cant wear contacts for 2 weeks, put a few drops in and go in for the procedure. The prep for the procedure takes about 45 mins. The procedure itself probably takes 20 mins. Plan to be there 2 hours (includes waiting time). They will give you some Zanex to relax and trust me it helps. I didn't mind the contraption holding my eye open at all. I was TOTALLY relaxed.  Dr. Ugland and the nurses are totally warm, comforting and sweet, so that helps you relax also.\n\nThat day, you wear shields on your eyes (plastic see through covers) and go to sleep. The more you can rest, the better/faster you heal. I got up for a bit to eat dinner and that's it. Your eyes will feel slightly gritty like some sand is in them. Mentally prepare yourself before the procedure to NOT RUB YOUR EYES. Then you lubricate and put eye drops in your eyes every few hours to avoid an infection. You will naturally want to put wetting drops as they feel more dry.\n\nThe only side effect I experienced was that there's a halo around lights at night and  had some red spots on the white parts of my eyes from the pressure of the machine. About a month later it has subsided, but its normal for up to 3 months.\n\nThe result? Immediate. As soon as I got up from surgery, I could see the clock. I went in for my check up the next day and my vision was almost 20/15.. better than 20/20.\n\nToday was my one month follow up and my vision is 20/15.\n\nI can see my alarm clock, go swimming, travel with ease... its a miracle :) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think often times people forget about taking the train...in fact I'm guilty of it too...whenever I'm planning a trip I'm thinking airplane, car...even boat but not train! \n\nSo when my dad was planning a visit to see me from Virginia and said he was taking the train I thought that's old school...but very cool! \n\nInitially his train was supposed to arrive at 8:10pm but they had some sort of \""line crossing delay\"" and he finally made it in about an hour and a half later...I guess...stuff like that happens. \n\nAnyway, outside the station was a bit sketchy but when I walked in it was clean and like other reviews have said \""old and historic\"" Lots of wooden benches, a couple vending machines and the bathroom but hey what more could you ask for while you wait. Lucky for me everyone inside was nice and the people waiting with me were all very friendly. \n\nOverall, my dad said that the ride was good, he was in business class so they gave drinks and they had some food options for him. He liked being able to get up and walk around and having all that freedom...he said he will definitely recommend it! So since it's dad approved...see ya soon  Amtrak! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I love this spot! The food is great, the dining vibe is perfect (think cozy wine cellar) and all the staff are friendly. I mostly have visited for lunch, so prices are decent. Not sure how the dinner prices compare. \n\nTip: Stay away from he fresh bread... It is sinfully delicious, and you will not have willpower to leave room in your stomach for entrees (and they are worth it!) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Whoever designed the PHX airport, please come to SJC and do the same thing. This place is easy to get in, get around, get on the plane, and GO.\n\nThe security lines are short and effective, the car rental shuttles and service were easy to find and quick to drop us at the rental terminal and back to the airport itself.\n\nLove the little stores, the little places to stop and eat. Super fast on the baggage claim pickup. Clean, nice, easy, fast, effective. All the things I would 'crave' in an airport if I ever really stopped to think about it (thanks Yelp!).\n\nSJC, take some hints. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Definitely a solid place to go for some Mexican style pub food and a brew during the summer. This place is nice and intimate for venues as well, but when it's freezing, the inside can get pretty noisy and packed pretty quickly, so beware. They've also started Sunday night trivia which has become a big hit. Definitely worth checking out! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For the price my just warm baked cod was okay but had little taste sitting in  water. Sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine. Waitress Amber was courteous and attentive. I enjoyed dinner until our party of 5 was asked to leave because they needed the table. Really? We were quite dismayed and told the male cashier whose response was defensive and frankly, rude. He even said if he were here co-owner Al would have asked us to leave just as the other co-owner did tonight. Wow. If true I am disappointed, Al. Your staff just lost us as customers including the other party waiting in line who walked out after us upon hearing our complaint and the cashier's response. Boo, bad customer service and not worth the food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Unimpressed.  Food is okay, and service is good, but it's just not that great.\n\nThe food alone would be 4 stars if they were charging a bit less (Yes - I think value matters.  Almost anyone can serve you an above-average meal if price isn't an issue.)  The empanada was pretty good, but $3.50 for a tiny little beef empanada is ridiculous.  They're street food, for chrissake.  (The pickled onion condiment with them is really good, though.)  I had the tortilla de papa, which was pretty good, and my partner had a chicken dish (name escapes me) that was pretty good as well, and the salads were good.  \n\nBack to the pricing thing: they do have Inca Kola, which I love, but they charge $2.50 for a can.  I only got one because my partner had never had one, but $2.50?  Really?  I know the profit's in the drinks for restaurants, but a 12-pack of it cost the same as a 12 of Coke the last time I saw it in a grocery store.\n\nService was good.  Very friendly.  4 stars.\n\nDecor leaves much to be desired.  This is usually an area that doesn't bug me too much with restaurants, but this place looks ratty - worn carpet, cheap tile, faded pictures of someone's trip to Peru, furniture that looks like it belongs in a chain motel breakfast room.  The knickknacks for sale are nice, but they're not in a separate area, so it feels like you're eating in the middle of a gift shop.  Again, not awful if you're charging $5-7 or so per plate, but not when you've crossed the $10 threshold.  1 star.\n\nI'm split between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm skewing low on this place. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bad, just bad.\nFood is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?\nThis is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tiffany prices with Kay Jewelers selection.\n\nI've gone to this place a couple of times to look for various items over the past few years.  Every time I leave the store I always try to remind myself never to come back.\n\nThe prices are way more than what they should be.  Tacori rings and other merchandise is marked up about 30-40% more than other jewelry stores in Pittsburgh.\n\nI've had a couple of nice salespeople work with me, but some of the others were just plain rude.  They try to do a great job preying on Love by upselling items or addons that aren't even necessary.\n\nThere are many other great jewelry stores in Pittsburgh that you can look at other than here. <|endoftext|>

Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Is their infamous Chicken Fried Everything enough to blow me up into a giant hot air balloon until I go to 'Awesome-Portion-Heaven?' Yes. Is this something I'm gonna regret when I finally drag my body to the gym? Yes, BUT, I argue that you only live once and you should try one of the finest Chicken Fried Steaks around. The only bad thing I will say though is that their gravy is a little bland just by itself. I like mah gravy to taste like it could be an entree of it's own like it should, not as just a topping, but that's just the fatty inside me talking. Also, they get ya by asking if you want some more sauce or more of this, then when the bill comes they tack on extra money without warning me and I can't do anything but a major facepalm. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Absolute worst experience at a nail salon. My friend & I went to get our nails done, where the older man that worked there did mine. He had a very bad attitude & when I asked him to fix the shaping of my nails, he got mad and got nasty. My acrylics now look like crap, and i have cuts on my cuticles. My friend's nails looked like a 5 year old did them. Horrible paint job, shaping & when we went to go pay, the lady who did her nails over charged her by $15.00. We then had to go back in, so she could get her money back. Never going there again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Been going to Barriques in Fitchburg for maybe 10 years? The staff there was always a bit uppity, but I put up with it because the food and atmosphere was good. I think I even gave them good reviews in here before. My trip to Middleton pushed the needle over the edge, however. Pretty good line waiting at the register, while one of the wait people was ambling about, taking her own sweet time getting back. Several other staff went past the register without so much as an acknowledgement that anyone was there. When she finally decided to come back, turns out they were out of several items that were on the menu, and response was no apology, no sympathy, just \""if they aren't in the cooler over there we're out.\"" \n\nLeft and went to Culvers. Food and atmosphere are a bit less, but at least friendly and conscientious humans work there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> While considering dining options for our Phoenix trip I skipped over Hillstone once I saw it was affiliated with Houstons.  Chain....skip.  Imagine my surprise then when we were heading back from hiking at the Grand Canyon and we were tired, covered in clay, starving and in desperate need of food and a drink.  We skipped the idea of even going back to our hotel to shower as it was on the later side (9:45PM).  We drove by Hillstone, I recalled the mostly favorable reviews, it was open so we pulled in.  SO glad we did.  We had such a delightful experience at the bar.  The bartender was awesome....from picking out the perfect french white to his service, we had a great experience.\n\nBest part of the meal...the veggie burger.  Might of been one of the best things I ate while in PHX.  Worst...rainbow roll.  They were out of the roll we wanted and the bartender said this one would be great.  It's not sushi if it's rolled with a thick mayo-crab mixture.  yuck.  I want to taste the fish. \n\nHillstone has a fantastic patio and great open floor plan. \n\nTwo tired hikers thank you for a great evening! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very nice place to visit. Plan on walking at least an hour, closer to two.  Lots to see, many cactus, trees, desert flowers.  Disappointed that many exhibits were closed.  Maybe it was a seasonal thing. Wish they had some kind of tour. I think we would have gotten more out of it.  They seem to be doing a lot of work on the place, too, so that's a good thing.  I would have given 5 stars if more exhibits were open. <|endoftext|>

I was ready to get my grub on! We sat on the patio. It was very cute! It would be perfect for a date. \n\nWe were served some bread and ordered the three onion tarte that everyone raves about. It was good, not crap my pants good that I was expecting, but very good. It was flavorful and the crust was delicate and tasty.\n\nFor dinner we both ordered the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the mushroom sauce was excellent. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were well done also. We cleaned our plates and were stuffed so had to pass on dessert. Maybe next time. <|endoftext|>

Bobby and I always find ourselves here to escape the hectic downtown scene. They are closed Monday and Tuesday I believe. I'm always amazed at the different types of displays they have. Another great thing is that the displays are up for 3 months at a time, so if you really like something, you have the opportunity to go check it out again! :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There is a wide variety of food choices here, from salads to pizza. Steaks and seafood, Mexican to Cajun. Something for everyone, and great beers on tap all brewed in house as well as bottled beers and a full bar. The servers are friendly and efficient, they know their menu. An excellent choice out side of the box is the \""Bistro filet\"", ask for the Ale sauce on the side. My all time favorite is the Shrimp and Crab tower, with avocado in it and Pita on the side. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been with Sprint for around 10 years and have always received great customer service... until now. A few days ago my phone began shutting off after just a few minutes of use, even after being fully charged.\nSo I brought it in to the 20th Street location and after uttering these words \""My phone keeps shutting off and I'm not sure its the batte....\"" I was interrupted by the rep and told that I would have to leave my phone there for 24 hours while they ran diagnostics on it. Very inconvenient, but nothing else to do, so I agreed and was promptly hustled out the door.\nI returned the next day and was informed that my phone was in perfect working order! No problems at all. Okaaaaay... So I start looking my phone over and noticed that they didn't even do a factory reset (did they even run any tests at all?)  Then two minutes later lo and behold, my phone shuts down again in front of their eyes. After a few minutes of head-scratching they changed the battery ...the battery that they said was working perfectly just a few minutes before... and now it works again.\nMy suggestion: Go to the Sprint store at 890 N 54th St., Chandler, AZ 85226. A bit of drive, but worth an hour of useful time as opposed to 24 hours of incompetence. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Customer service here as in the whole of Royal Palms is nearly through the roof great, at times even bordering on obsequious. Service was not quite excellent, but it's really great. Had dinner here and ordered tasting menu ($40) and accompanying libations ($20). The tenderloin was pretty much the best tenderloin I've ever eaten. The beet salad was delicious and the cheesecake was thick and creamy. My bf had the antelope (!!) which he thought was great, cooked to perfection, tender and tasty.The accompanying drinks were interesting and fun, but I'm not a big drinker so I reached my limit pretty early. \n\nI don't know about y'all who are complaining about portion sizes, portions are normal-sized and VERY filling. If you're used to strapping on the feedbag at a buffet, then you may be disappointed, but the bf was happily full and I left STUFFED and quite happy. \n\nI highly recommend! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I never knew this place existed until today when a client asked to be taken here for lunch. He was an older guy, but I figured it would be good because I suggested Chelsea's Kitchen and he stayed on track wanting to go to this place.\n\nShortly after my whining tantrum caused purely by jealousy after driving through the Biltmore Estates we arrived at the restaurant. It is connected to the Golf Course but certainly isn't a \""Biltmore\"" experience.\n\nObviously inexperienced wait staff (who did just fine, but a little awkward) and very limited menu. Just one side of one page with very normal stuff like burgers and turkey sandwiches.\n\nI got a grilled chicken sandwich, by other two coworkers got sammies also. One a BBQ chicken and the other a burger. Our client got a turkey sandwich. ho hum..\n\nNothing to rave about. Several other older folks at tables. I'd say it was just fine for the price point but certainly not a place to go to unless you are hungry before or after a round and want a bite to eat. Considering the options in the area, I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am leaving my previous review below, but I subsequently had a terrible experience here.\n\nI needed a new car headlight, and they screwed it up and fried my car.  It took three employees hours to get the headlight changed, and in the process of troubleshooting the damage that their sausage fingers had done in the engine, took out some fuse box thing and put it back upside down.  At that point nothing electronic in my car worked, and the car itself wouldn't start the next day.  A competent mechanic fixed it, but it cost me a significant amount of money and time in towing and mechanic fees.  Autozone was not interested in reimbursing me for the damage they had caused.\n\nOld review:\nI just got home from having a new battery put in my car, and I was super happy with my new favorite car store!  \n\nI am incompetent at cars, so I went in saying I thought my battery might be mostly dead.  It was.  Car stuff's expensive.  I'll forgive them.  The Autozone kid was super helpful though.  He spent a good half hour inside car, removing the old battery (my car is the \""labor intensive\"" kind of battery holder) and gouging out all the corrosion I had let accumulate.  A half an hour!  He could have easily just told me to do it myself.  \n\nMany a restaurant or retailer could learn from the Autozone business model.  Good service is awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said, I found the crepes to be overly thick and the filling, while tasty, too skimpy and thus overpowered by the crepes wrap. But it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment. I was in Pittsburgh visiting a relative with terminal cancer at the nearby hospital ; she had requested a breakfast crepes so I found Cafe Parisiennes through Yelp. We were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours. The sign said the Cafe opened at 10:00AM, which was when we arrived. We could see staff inside and asked if we could come in. The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready \""in ten minutes\"" or so. After another ten minutes, we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order, I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange. This is not the kind of attitude for anyone in a service business and I would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Spaghetti Warehouse THEFT!!!!!  \nLet me just state I wish I could give it a less than one star review.\n\nHere's a story for everyone, do with it what you will:\n\nLast Saturday, I go to Spaghetti Warehouse for the murder mystery dinner. After leaving, I realize I forgot my scarf. I call back and ask the person who answers the phone, mind you her name was Stephanie, and I only remembered that because..weird that's my name, to go look for it. Stephanie gets back on the phone says she found it and will put it aside for me. Now I meant to get back there the next day, Sunday, however with my busy life I wasn't able to get back until today, Saturday. \n\nThis is exactly one week later, I go in the afternoon, when it's not busy and waited for about 20 minutes for them to look for my scarf. Now mind you, they don't have a designated location for lost and found stuff, when I suggested that, the hostess told me that people don't normally leave stuff. YEAAA, because I'm sure I'm the only on in Spaghetti Warehouse history to leave an item behind. \n\nAfter 20 minutes passes, I have 2 managers talking to me, one of which says he knows the girl who found it, and he called her and left a message when there was no answer. The other manager told me he knows nothing about it and can't do anything until they speak to that employee. I asked when the employee would be back, and was told this afternoon. I also asked what happens when they can't find my scarf (at this point I'm assuming an employee stole it) and was told that we would cross that bridge when and if it comes to it.\n\nSix hours elapse, now I'm thinking to myself, even if this girl was not suppose to come in tonight she would at least call her employer back, right? Well I call the Spaghetti Warehouse to talk to the one manager, and low and behold Stephanie answers the phone. I'm told I can't talk to a manager because they are really busy at the moment. Strike 2, there should always be a manager on call and able to talk to customers at any point in time. I say nevermind I'll be down. \n\nHead down to Spaghetti Warehouse for the second time today, this time with my friend who was with me the night of the dinner. She goes in first as a set up asking for something completely different from that night, Stephanie admits to only finding a scarf. So I follow suit and come in, the other hostess who helped me early says they still didn't find it. That's funny Stephanie just said she found it. The manager who I spoke to earlier comes out to talk to me, in the lobby of the busy dinner rush. Doesn't pull me aside and proceeds to argue with me in front of customers.  He had zero resolutions prepared, and does not come up with one until after told we would file charges and call the better business bureau. Finally, the best excuse that he can come up with is that, someone must've thrown it away. EXCUSE ME! \n\nSo, if I accidentally left something behind, and called to ask for it to be put aside, someone throws it away?! After being threatened with criminal charges, and calling the better business bureau he finally comes up with a resolution. If I have the receipt I can bring it down and they will reimburse me, what if I can't find the receipt? Well then you can you go buy another one, and the bring the receipt and we will reimburse you. Ok, so I have to take time out of my day to go to buy a scarf (in hopes they still have the same one!) and then bring it back down here in order to get my money back, and not to mention waste gas driving back and forth. Ends up just giving me the $20 on the spot. Which still isn't the point of all this, your employee stole, you didn't even think to question it when that employee is standing 5 feet away, oh and the couple beside us heard the entire argument, and the lobby was told not to leave anything behind because they will steal it or throw it away. Isn't the customer always right?\n\nWILL NEVER GO TO THE SPAGHETTI WAREHOUSE AGAIN IN MY LIFE OUT OF PRINCIPAL! AND THE FOOD ISN'T EVEN GOOD!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Super fun nerd store with comic books, some games, and fun gifts.  It is unusually clean with really nice salespeople.  They also have fun events periodically. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I live in one of Roland's smaller buildings in Champaign. They are the best landlord I've ever had. They respond very quickly to maintenance requests, and if the guy couldn't fix the problem, boom, new appliance. You can pay the rent online and submit work orders online. The office guys are very nice and helpful. I would rent from them again in a heartbeat. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped in here to give it a try for lunch today, & found it to be ok looking inside.  It's a little banged up, but a lot of decor makes it kind of comfortable & homey, & they have well placed booths for seating, as well as tables.  From there on, unfortunately, it was mostly downhill:\n\n*  There were no paper towels in the bathroom.\n\n*  My table was dirty, with lots of crumbs & other food stuck to it from the previous diner.\n\n*  It's too expensive for this kind of place!  A Combo with a Chile Relleno, Enchilada, & a taco costs $10!\n\n*  The service took FOREVER!!  ...over half an hour between the time I ordered & when I received all of my food.  (The taco showed up ala carte at around the 25 minutes point.)\n\n*  I had to chase down the waitress & ASK to get any napkins & silverware.  (This was way out past when the taco had arrived & my hands were all greasy.)\n\n*  There was not only a TV on, but there were rock oldies playing over the PA System, & then pretty soon there was a jukebox blaring Mexican music out on top of everything else.  What a cacophony!  HEY!  PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO EAT IN HERE!\n\nYes, the food was pretty good, but that's the only thing saving this place from a 1 Star rating.  There were too may problems, & I won't be returning.     :-( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> An excellent food co-op, with a sincere interest in the community. The produce section is well managed, and the greens are fresh, many are locally sourced. Events, discounts for owners (a onetime fee) with each purchase, friendly advice, and consistent quality. I am very happy with the CG Co-op. The recent sale of plants was superb - horseradish root, sungold tomato plants, etc...Keep up the good work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i recently moved into cityscape, a high rise apt. bldg. just a block or two away from this establishment and i've started trying out the local eateries as i don't like to cook much. i ordered a tavern burger and cottage cheese. when asked how i wanted the burger i said well done, meaning no pink, but specifically stated i didn't want the burger to be burned and/or dry. the bartender assured me that would not happen. well, guess what? the burger was way overdone and left a bad aftertaste that lingered for quite a while. i should have requested the burger be tossed and another mad however i just wasn't in the mood for a hassle. plus the bartender never did ask how my food was. it's a shame as i left very unsatisfied and with a burnt taste in my mouth, unlikely to every return or to recommend this place to others. i'm sure it was not intentional but the result was still the same. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've had their food before and it was very good and last night wasn't exactly an exception.  My issue is that my 8 year old had their chicken fingers, which I tried and were quite tasty.  After our meal my son stated he felt ill, and this morning woke up with a mild case of food poisoning.  I will be avoiding this place for the foreeable future.  This is unfortunate, as their enchiladas are delicious but I simply will not risk my son getting sick again.  Sorry Mi Amigos, your apparent lack of food preparation cleanliness has lost you customer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> BBQ Night - Thursdays - what can I say?  Go and get some!  SUPER tender spareribs slip right off the bone and into your mouth.  LEAN brisket with nary a piece of fat to be seen--which works great for me!  Imported Elgin, TX hot link--bona-fide, delicious, and not really all that hot.  But the KING is the prime rib.  Steve mentioned on \""Check Please!\"" that this is the best thing on the menu.  He was not lying.  Definitely a tie for my first place with a few other dishes (can't get over the Chicken Fried Chicken or the Pecan Pie) . . . but, by itself, probably the best prime rib I have ever had.  Puts high-end steak restaurants to SHAME!  Soft, delicious, moist, smoky.  Melts in your mouth.  Definitely will be back soon after 4 PM for more Prime RIB!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this Jamba Juice.  The bo-go coupons come through so often that it makes it tough to go there without one.  I have to modify my order to make it dairy.  Pet peeve- it's \""sherbet\"", not \""sher-beRt\"".  There is no second \""r\"".  If you're in the smoothie biz, please say it right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If your lookin for a good price, and not so much quality, then yea. This is definitely the place for you. Unless you are drunk, then I'm sure it tastes awesome.\n\nI've never had a good pizza from here, the toppings fall off before you can even pick to your slice.\n\nWe usually pick up our own pizza since its on the way, but the pizza seems like its been sitting out longer than the allotted 25 min.\n\nAlso, the chicken *poppers* are more like chicken nuggets, and not tasty at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have enjoyed my stay very much. The complimentary breakfast was also very delicious. My room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint was the amount of TV channels offered, however you get free WiFi. I would stay here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Canyon Cafe has the potential to be an idyllic restaurant, but falls short on nearly all aspects one desires in a dining experience. I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\""Oh, you're not finished?\""\n    No.\n\""Just enjoying the weather?\""\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't frequent bars all that often (mostly because I don't enjoy them) but Merc is my favorite, hands down.  It's got a cool, speakeasy, Prohibition-era vibe that is really unusual.  The cocktail menu is by far the most interesting I've ever seen.  You don't go there to drink - you go there to experience.  We sat at the bar last night and were greatly entertained by the bartender and chef.  The bartender (I think his name was Aaron?) really knew his stuff.  I truly wish I lived closer... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!\n\nThis is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.\n\nFrom a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> How have I never even heard of this place?!?! The husband and I wanted to get Italian and were planning on going somewhere else.... but it was so far away... and we were so hungry.... so I looked on Yelp (of course) and found this hidden gem! This place is so awesome. It is totally a throw back... red table clothes that are wipe cleanable, a CRT tv playing true crimes sitting on the counter, and Donna. Oh my goodness, Donna is one of the most awesome ladies I have come in contact with in a long time. She is definitely an East coast kinda lady, she is a no nonsense straightforward gal, but also a really sweet and thoughtful person.... they were out of lasagna tonight, but she could tell I really wanted it and got the kitchen to make one special for me...how above and beyond is that? Not only that, but the lasagna was legit.... two different types of sausage, a ton of melty cheese, and a nice flavorful sauce. It was also huge, plenty for two meals. It came with garlic bread that was actually garlicky (I know, crazy) and was a great complement to the pasta. We also had a pepperoni calzone which was ridic good. The ricotta was well seasoned, the crust was perfectly cooked, crispy, and had garlicky seasoning on top. I would definitely get this again. Oh ya, it was also big enough for two meals. All of this food was 20$.... you heard me, 20$!!! This was quite the deal. I think we found our new favorite Italian place in Phoenix.... We'll be back and suggest you give it a shot too!\n\n\nPS they are BYOB\nPPS this place has 5 star potential, I just need a second visit to confirm the experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best Video Store in town. I drive an extra ten minutes to rent here but always worth. Only complaint is the price is a bit much. Staff is Awesome and know a thing or two about movies. They have some really hard to find movies. \nBeats Redbox,Blockbuster and Netflix. Of course the best part is it is Local!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We've been to a closer La Parrilla Suiza before, so when it turned out that we could get diner miles by going to this one, we thought we'd try it, even though it's much further out.\n\nMaybe they had an off night, but I had some serious issues with hygiene! I'm not usually too fussy on this kind of thing, but the tables were dirty, there was old crud and new food stuck all over the table and in the grout lines of the tiled table, the floors had clearly not been cleaned in a while (food from previous diners was still all over the floor) and the toilets were in a terrible state of disrepair!\n\nOne toilet was completely blocked, another was covered in excrement and the sink wall had some kind of damage too, like a chunk off the wall missing. There was water/pee and toilet paper all over the floor too!\n\nWhen my daughter and I returned from the restroom, we told the waiter what state the ladies was in and he somewhat grunted in acknowledgement, but when my daughter needed to go again before leaving, nothing had changed.\n\nThe food was ok, but to be honest, I had a hard time enjoying it.\n\nWe won't be returning! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We really enjoy Ballet Arizona productions. We recently saw The Nutcracker - an annual family tradition. They make a few modifications to the program every year. I really liked the tweaks this year. We also happened to attend a showing where Astrit Zejinati and Chelsea Wilcox doing the pas de deux. They were absolutely amazing. \n\nOur 5 year old has also been taking ballet lessons at the school there since she was 3.  We think the school is wonderful. They teach classical ballet vocabulary from 3 years old on. They are pretty strict and have a set curriculum. They all wear the same uniform and hairstyle and are strict about it. After the 3 year old class, parent's aren't allowed to watch other than one class per session where they let us all in. \n\nSo far, from what we've seen though, the curriculum and the teachers are great. They do a lot to improve body control, teach musicality and start them on a course of classical ballet.\n\nWe're big fans. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When I crave Mexican food but don't want something smothered in cheese and grease, I come to La Parilla Suiza.  I have been here several times, and everything I have had has been great. Most recently, I had a cup of the chicken and rice soup, and a fajita taco a la carte. My husband has the bistec (sp?) tacos. He really liked them.  This place is not too filling and yet you feel very satisfied. Its pretty cool too because you get to watch the guys making everything through one of those glass windows. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'd say this is one of the more consistent lunch places in uptown. I usually get the dynasty noodles with a side hot sauce and the food always comes out pretty quickly. I guess they've got to keep the food moving since there's always a crowd during lunch hour. I wouldn't say that it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it definitely is one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Pretzel rolls are served with a spicy mustard on the side that is to die for.  Food and service is always on point.  They have my Husbands favorite draft beer all year round- Oktoberfest. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Have known this place has been around for quite some time and have always said that we needed to try.  Well, finally had a chance to do so and I must say I was pleased.  Now I'm thinking what took so long?\n\nOrdered the 2 pc fish with chips.  The fish, nice sized pieces of cod, with a nice and crunchy coating was delicious.  My friend's son, who's 13 and just released from hospital wanted to go to lunch, got the 2 pc fish, 2 pc shrimp and chips.  The shrimp were large sized and he enjoyed it tremendously.  I was surprised he ate almost everything.  \n\nThough we live in Goodyear, will definitely be going back for more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Big fan!  First time i have ever been to this place, and the milkshake I got was delicious.  My mother also got a frozen coffee, and I think I wound up drinking all of it for her.\n\nThe cookies that were there also were great.  I am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not, but they were delicious.  \n\nDefiantly the best stop my mother and I had while we were on Walnut street, and i would venture back to the place in a second.\n\nPS the wait staff was also very pleasant and kind. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I found it one Open kitchen. We read the reviews and decided to try it out. We waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door. The hostess asked us if we wanted the formal dining area or lounge. We chose the lounge. She asked if we wanted a wine list. We said yes. Bread was brought over and that wS the last we saw of anyone for 20 minutes. Finally, I said lets go. My husband went to find the hostess and I guess a manager came and asked if we have been helped. I said no, and he brought someone over. The waiter didn't seem to thrilled to serve us. He had trouble remembering the specials. Not impressed with the service, staff, or food. Won't be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bad,  very bad.    Ordered Gin and Tonic.....tonic water was as flat as water.   Returned drinks and ordered wine.   Wine was ok but overpriced.    Ordered an omelet which was basically an egg pancake with the omelet stuff dumped on top.     Home fries were undercooked.   Biscuit had overpowering flavor of artificial butter.   \nThe chicken on the salad was entrenched with artificial flavor.    I think this restaurant does not use 'fresh' ingredients and buys a lot of things already prepared and all they have to do is 'heat things up'.    So their lazy way of doing things certainly has lost us as a customer.   Also....the waitress was wearing cologne or perfume...lots of it...her scent lingered on and on.   NO Server should be wearing a scent at work.   I would equate their food with a fast food restaurant.   Not a compliment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Oh, I had fun here. They just need more portapottys. It's something to do and somewhere to people watch. And the fireworks were pretty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Chico's is delicious and in a convenient location! It's by no means gourmet. But hey, if you're in the area and looking for some decent food at a reasonable price, Chico's is the place.\n\nI come here every Tuesday during my class breaks at ASU's downtown campus. I recommend the chicken taco salad :) The shell is crispy and light, filled with creamy refried beans, grilled chicken (sometimes a little too blackened for my taste), lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. They also have a wide variety of fresh salsas at their salsa bar! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Costco is the Shiznit. They have everything and not to mention the fact that their generic brand (kirkland) is the best of any generic. They have great food and a Super cheap food court (that only takes cash). You cannot beat Costco. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because the Chandler location is nicer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The hotel has an incredible amount of charm.  You get the feeling that you just stepped back in time when you walk into the lobby.  The elevators still have the classic rotating needle that shows what floor the elevator is on.  We stayed in the Governor's Suite, and it too was eking of nostalgia.\nUnfortunately some of the staff members did not have the same amount of charm to match the hotel's architecture and styling.  In particular, everyone we encountered at the front desk did not provide service you would expect at a classic establishment as this.  \nOn the other hand, the Valet Attendant exceeded my expectations.  He was very personable and helpful.  Furthermore, the bartender at the Ghost Lounge was equally personable and made us feel welcome each time we returned.  It appears that he recently purchased the lounge/bar.  He has a great personality and attitude.  I wish him the best.\nThe hotel is known for it's haunted nature.  I was not pleased to hear this.  Some may be attracted by this.  My over active mind kept me thinking of ghosts in the middle of the night. That's just my fault. \nOverall, a historic hotel with a lot of personality.  The hotel might benefit by training the front desk in proper hotel etiquette and professionalism. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Saturday night. Looking forward to this show and we got here before 8pm. Show started near 930. So freaking crowded you can't see the band.  Its so loud you cant hear the band.  Fire Marshall bill would close the place. So over capacity you can't move. Let alone get to the bathroom. All about greed. Need to stop ticket sales while there is still room to move. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great service, terrible food. I was looking forward to eating at Christo's and the longer I was there, the more disappointed I became. Funky house salad with a creamy ranch (?) dressing and one slice of bad hot house tomato. The lemon rice soup was boiling hot, but not awful. White French baguette bread and butter was plentiful, thank god. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland and my veal entr\u00e9e was drowned in sauce. The service was 5 star, I'll give them that. I suppose I came away with the thought that I'd rather have lousy service and good to great food than great service and lousy food. Maybe I should have tried one of the 3,000 specials our Italian waiter rattled off before we ordered. By the time he was finished, the only thing I remembered him saying was, \""...topped with feta cheese.\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Dear FedEx Office / Kinkos, you have saved my ass on numerous occasions, and I am forever indebted to your fabulous hours and helpful staff. \n\nBeing the procrastinator I am, this place is my haven on Sunday night when those nasty Monday morning presentations need to be..well, presented. Went in here again last night with the same scenario, and got in an out with no problems! Living on my Mac for so long caused me to feel like an idiot when it came to the Windows operating systems, but with a little assistance, I got it! 10 page presentation with color images for 8 bucks? Heck yes. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible horrible service. Beer and food is great, neighborhood bar so it's convenient. Went in today for my last time. They were short handed which I could understand, but the managers were even terrible. Server never brought our food, let alone check on us. I had to get up to get a beer, napkins, plates, etc. Had to basically yell and wave my arms just to get the check...we complained about the service only to get a \""thumbs up\"" and a smile then walked away....LITTERALLY. No joke. The manager kept saying he would get our server to us, which never happened. All tables around us were just as unsatisfied.  Too bad for them, I know after today many people will not be back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Panda and this is one of my most favorite fast food restaurants in Phoenix. I love the way they cook their orange chicken. It tastes so good. Even I am not hungry I can buy a bowl and finish it off. I think their orange chicken is the best and after that honey walnut shrimp. \n\nThe store is clean and I have never had any problem with them. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I got a \""low-reg\"" fade and it was $12. The building says $9.99, but that's for Wednesdays only. They apparently used to have Thursday specials as well, but all the signs have had it removed. I forgot the other prices, I'll probably snap a photo next time.\n\nWent in and was actually surprised that it looked as nice as it did. It's not an elegant, $20 barbershop, but coming from San Diego, I was pleasantly surprised they had something other than cheap seating. It looks like they tried to make it look old school and classic, but tried is the key word. Overall, I dig the feel of this place.\n\nThere was only one barber, a middle-aged Russian (I'm assuming) lady who was friendly. Didn't talk, but I'm not one that likes to converse with barbers, so I prefer this kind of feel - only mentioning it because some people look forward to telling their barbers their life's stories. \n\nI would definitely go back here again. I only knocked off 1 star because at the end she gave me clipper burn cleaning up those pesky bottom neck hairs. Not a huge deal for me to be honest, but it does sting a little bit. However, the fade was so good, I can handle a little weakness leaving my body ;). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Every time my upgrade rolls around, I go to this Sprint store first because it's closest to my house. Every time, I'm disappointed and end up going somewhere else (usually the Best Buy across the street) for my phone because this store does not have helpful employees. They are not kind, they'll tell you \""This is what we can do. Take it or leave it\"" and usually what they offer is not doable at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Based on previous yelp reviews, I was hoping to find another phoenix gem but alas I was dissapointed.\n\nThe one thing about the reviews that was correct: service is not great.\n\nHere's the simple lowdown:\n\nFood is a solid 3\n\nChips and Salsa were decent - chips were nice a warm\n\nGuac sucks - its the kind that they make every so often and put in refrigerator (try los somberros or bario cafe for real gauc)\n\nTaco - good flavor on the ground beef - but taco was luke warm, like it had been sitting 10-15 minutes\n\nFood Smell - I'm not sure if this was because I read on previus review...But I did notice a wierd smell to the enchilada. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We ordered the stuffed pizza. While similar to a Chicao-style pizza, this  had a bottom and top crust, as well as sauce on the top. It was FABULOUS! And it comes with 3 toppings for under $15. You gotta try it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We ordered pizza delivery half Chicago and half Italiano, although it tooks in total 1 hour , they told us in advance so we were ready to wait. The delivery girl was friendly. The pizza was delicious, but a little pricey - its expensive when you add $5 delivery charge. Maybe next time we will pick up or go to the restaurant. I recommend it if you want a good pizza <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was my first time at the Elbow Room at their new location on Walnut Street (previously located on Ellsworth Avenue.) My friend and I met for a low key Friday night dinner, but when we arrived at 6:30pm, to our surprise - it was PACKED!! It was really nice to see it so lively and bustling with a ton of people. It was a 30 minute wait for a table, and in that time we grabbed a drink at that bar. By the time we did that, our table was ready. After we ordered, our appetizer, salads, and entrees were all out within 15-20 minutes. The service was amazing, from our waitress, to even the owner coming out to make sure everything was ok. We ordered the fried zucchini for an appetizer, which was good but I thought the breading as a little bland, a great side salad, and I had the mediterranean pasta for my entree. Everything was better than I had expected it to be and I will definitely be returning for happy hour and dinner, hopefully very soon! 2 thumbs up! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n  \n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was extremely underwhelmed with Tuesday Morning. The commercial with Lauren Bacall is classy, this place is not. It remined me of a thrift store.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm so over T-Bones.\n\nI used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.\n\nI'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Can't beat the location if you're a student.  I went in here for a regular annual eye-exam.  It was quick and easy, the doctor was knowledgable, and they didn't try to upsell me on anything like I've seen at some other eye doctors.\n\nWill be going back next year. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.\n\nTerminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.\n.  \nTo go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.\n\nThe other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.\n\nGet going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to \""the hood\"" for some really good food.\n\nLunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).\n\nMy favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Really disappointing. Service is bad when you enter. If it is busy expect to be treated poorly. Have a reservation? That will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else. Once seated servers are pleasant and nice,\n\nThe food is poor. Verges on disgusting. I had their much-beloved squid ink linguine with lobster. The pasta was mushy--way overcooked. Far too much cream and cheese. Lobster meat suspiciously tasted like it was recently thawed out from a frozen state. Didn't finish this dish.\n\nMy wife had a chicken special. Dry. Boring. Bland.\n\nMaybe we just had a bad experience (it was a busy Friday night 8pm). The popularity of the place and the plethora of positive reviews and high ratings indicates that this might have some great moments, but unfortunately not this time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Thank god for the delicious food, because the poor service I've received from Shannon on numerous occasions for take-out would have deterred me from coming back a long time ago. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ordered mock duck curry and mussamun curry. Very disappointed. Both Seemed very oily and extremely watery. The consistency of the curry was just not there. Potato in the curry tasted like it was canned. No authentic Thai flavors. Bland and tasteless. No taste of herbs or coconut milk. Have tried some of their noodles before which is good. Will probably give one more chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible!! In September 2013, we took my daughter's Yamaha trumpet in for a minor repair. In January, they still had not repaired it. In February, when we returned again not only had it NOT been repaired, they had somehow caved in one of the valves. They did not charge us, but in no way did they offer to try to make it better or even apologize for the additional damage they did. A completely shameful way to do business. Customer beware. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were having a Gender Naming Party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family. When we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order. The mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby! Without her husband! This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive, condescending, and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery. We have done wedding cakes here, and many special events over the years. Never again!! Potomac Bakery you should be ashamed. <|endoftext|>

The server was rude and ungrateful. She reminded me of Lindsay Lohan filming her reality show.\n\nThe atmosphere in the wine bar is fabulous and the food is decent.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here on the strength of a friend's recommendation and, boy, am I glad I did!  I walked in and announced, \""I have a 13 year old Toyota with 150,000 miles on it and, given all that, I hear that it might need new hoses and belts.\""  Many mechanics would take one look at me, take one look at my car, and see money signs.  Not at Inman's!  They did a FREE inspection and then had a frank discussion with me about when to get the belt and hose maintenance work done.  And the price they quoted was several hundred dollars cheaper than the price quoted by the one other mechanic that I talked with (by telephone).  Inman's certainly earned my respect today and they will earn my dollars in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love it. 6 stars - at least. Great service from everyone. Server, manager, hostess. Great pizza. I'm a bit of pizza snob and I really like this pizza. And I think it's a great value. 2 adults, 2 kids - when the check came I truly felt it was a great deal. We've been twice and it's instantly become a favorite. Signature Spinach extra crispy - love the garlic - so good. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went there while visiting Charlotte.  Found the place cold, thermally and ambiance.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Amongst the worst fast food burgers.  A step up from Sonic, McDonalds, and Jack in the Box, but not nearly as good as the others.  \""Not nearly as good as Burger King\"" ain't the biggest selling point.\n\nWhat in the world is that crap you call a bun?  Easily the worst bun on Earth.  I've had better bread in Africa, no joke.  A step BELOW wonderbread.  Heck, a step below stale wonderbread.  Awful.  You know those burger buns you get in an 8 pack in the grocery store that are all stuck together?  The things you buy because you feel lazy or are strapped for cash?  Those are ok.  Whataburger isn't.  It's far, far, far worse than that.  Look at these pictures.  The bun is like play-doh or a circus peanut.  Gross.  Did you read the part where I said it's worse than food in Africa?  Because it's worse than food in Africa.\n\nI've been here over 10 times because it's open late and I worked third shift for a couple years.  Well, I don't anymore and I tried this place for lunch at noon.  Still awful.  How the heck could anybody like this place?!\n\n2 stars because it isn't McDonalds, although McDonalds has better buns.  But I'd still literally rather get punched than eat a burger with a McDonalds bun.\n\nWhataburger: Worse Than A Punch\n\n\nedit to add:  Also if you go to the drivethrough, expect to wait 20 minutes if there is nobody in front of you.  If there is, play a few hands of solitaire on your dashboard.  Slow as hell. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Comfortable place that is our most frequent and favorite dining spot......if Norm and Cliff ever moved to Pittsburgh, this is where they would hang...........we like all of their food! Finding a place to park is my only complaint. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 3.5 stars.  Nothing special, but everything was fairly well done.  Went for a lunch meeting and had the southwest salad.  The jalapeno ranch was made in house and was great.  The baguette on the side was a nice touch.  Service was perfect: attentive but not hovering.  We were able to get in and out quickly.  Other diner thought the ahi tuna salad was good as well.  Tuna was perfectly done and contained a good sized lunch portion.  Other meals (chicken avocado sandwich and bacon cheeseburger) looked uninteresting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So after driving by this place for a few years always wanting to try it out I finally did.  I am so thankful reading the yelp reviews helped my decision to finally try this place out cause it is some of the best cuban food I've ever had.  \n\nFor starters I got the calypso chips which are fried plantain chips and a black bean dip.  So awesome I could have just had that.  I also got this brazilian sugar cane drink with lime juice that was a twist on a mojito and it was awesome.  \n\nFor my entree I got the Boliche Mechado which is a Cuban pot roast stuffed with Spanish chorizo and simmered in a red wine sauce. Served with spicy potatoes which also were just excellent.  I am a huge chorizo fan so when I saw this on the menu I knew it was the choice.  \n\nI was too full for dessert so I couldn't try any of the amazing selections that were on the menu but I will be back for that for sure.  Also they have paella which I must go back for cause it had chorizo, scallops, clams, and mussles.  Sounds delicious.  \n\nThanks again yelp for another push to try a local hot spot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A quiet bar out in Middleton, it's certainly not the worst, but it ain't the greatest either.\n\nHaving now played 2 sessions of their \""intermediate\"" volleyball leagues, I'm wishing the second one ended sooner.  They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water.  I've heard rumors of sand volleyball...in the snow.  Maybe I'm just bitter. cold.\n\nThe food is nothing worth writing home about.  The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent.  I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star.  Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials.  Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking.\n\nThe TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell.  There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used.They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well.\n\nThe bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you.  After my 4th or 5th trip there (again, because of the volleyball league), they were friendly and joking around with the crew. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Here for a conference (does anyone actually come to the city of phoenix for anything else?). I should have known not to set foot inside just how empty it was compared to the place next door. This place is honestly one of the most disorganized places I've eaten at. The waiters literally are running around, and just getting a seat in the empty restaurant was a process.  We received no less than 7 apologies throughout our dinner. I'm not sure why they kept apologizing as they weren't always doing anything wrong... they must just be used to people complaining or something. I got a salad and while it is pretty hard to mess up a salad, this was not very good. The meat (pulled pork) on the salad was gross, and the sour cream was hard and gross... the lettuce was standard iceberg cut up. My dining partner had the gyro and the meat was gross and he just ended up eating the fries. Also, although it looks like they did at one time, they no longer serve alcohol. That should be a sign to stay away. I feel bad for the waiters as this place obviously is in need of new management and a menu overhaul. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I try to make it here at least once a week. Consistently good quality food and great service every time I've been in. Pretty good happy hour menu but I usually do their dinner for 2 promotions and Presidente margaritas. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So since I work downtown every once in a while,  when one of my co-workers feels up to it, he will make a Ritos run. Although I have never been to the physical location, I have to say that Ritos is hands down my favorite Mexican food place. I always order the green Chile burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and die and go to Heaven every time! I have also had their beef tacos with guacamole and the meat is so tender and juicy, it's truly amazing. I just wish they were open for a dinner run or on weekends so I could take my hubby. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great authentic Mexican food. It was very hole in the wall and place and looked dirty but the food was great!! The tortillas were the best I've ever had at a restaurant. It wasn't located in the best of locations, but next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be sure to stop by. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When you first enter the restaurant the smell of stale smoke smacks you in the face. The d\u00e9cor is so worn down I do not think it has ever been updated. The view of the greenish/brown pond is the only relief that you get from drab run down dinning room. Our waiter was inattentive and disorganized, we had to ask him multiple times for the same things throughout the meal. Every time we asked him for something it would be 20 minutes before we saw him again. He messed the bill up and it took him 15 minutes to fix it and another 15 minutes to bring change. I ordered the eggs benedict which I thought tasted great. My husband on the other hand ordered the chicken fried steak skillet which was burnt and extremely chewy. Overall this was a poor experience. The only reason I would go back would be to sit on the patio when the weather is nice and drink a beer! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Checked this out for the first time with my boyfriend on Father's day. Waitresses were super cute and friendly. Ordered an Ice Cream Soda with Butterscotch soda and pecan praline icecream. It was sooo good! Had the reuben sandwich was also really good.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Merry-Ann's Diner is the definition of mediocrity when it comes to diners. Unfortunately, Champaign has a lack of diners and 24 hour restaurants.  I usually get the Diner Stack or the Hangover Stack if I go in past midnight. Both are pretty average with the sausage gravy masking the rubbery taste of the hamburger and the hashbrowns tending to be the best part of the meal. I don't necessarily think that Merry-Ann's is bad, but there are better breakfast places (Sammie's Pancake House in Champaign is much better/cheaper in my opinion) and late night places (almost anything on Green Street). It's definitely better than the IHOP on Green Street, which is terrible in every conceivable manner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed.

It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was my first trip to Charlotte. I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in, they had a five day wedding celebration in progress. No bell captains available upon check-in. When we got up to the room, I was very surprised to see how outdated it was for the money. Ripped curtains, blown out light bulbs in bathroom. And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge. Upon my morning cup of coffee in the room, the mini creamers were sour. I called room service, and they never brought them up. Nor did they refresh the coffee station when they cleaned the room. No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7:00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break. Only to have nothing but a out of date room, tons of noise, and a unclean looking surrounding. Guests should have been forewarned of the wedding festivities when booking. Although, the staff was very accommodating, they weren't on a mini vacation, we were. The only thing we were offered was free coffee or a breakfast beverage in the morning ! Also, be aware, if you don't join their rewards club, check your bill for a $9.95 a day charge for Internet. We were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all. See attached pictures. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't comment on the selection of items, because I barely made it through the door. The staff at this store is very rude. \n\nI specifically drove here because I was excited to see what they have here. I LOVE stationery and paper goods and am nostalgic for my favorite stores of that kind from my time living on the east coast. It was 3:55pm on a Saturday, and apparently they close at 4 (I didn't know). \n\nWhen my husband and I walked in, two store people were at the register helping another customer. Instead of greeting me, they looked at my with shock to see me and asked emphatically, \""Can I help you?\"" As though I were in the wrong place. \n\nAt first I thought I must be confused, that I'd walked into an appointment-only card shop. Realizing they were closing a few minutes later, I explained I had driven to come see the store and that I hadn't realized they were closing soon, and I made a motion for the door. Realizing their own rudeness and perhaps that another customer was watching this, they begrudgingly mumbled something about how I could stay but it was clearly half-hearted. \""Come back another time!\"" they said. \n\nI absolutely will not be coming back another time because that behavior was nuts! I worked many boutique retail jobs throughout college and would never have treated a customer that way. In fact, as a rule of thumb, most small shops don't mention closing time to customers until after they've closed, and then only to explain why you're locking the door or pulling down displays (gentle coaxing that you are winding down). \n\nThey definitely lost a customer today--and for all future visits. \n\nI also never write Yelp reviews--I just was so bowled over by the terrible customer service that I felt compelled in hopes that other people won't waste a trip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I bought a pair of shoes from Dee's. I was starting a new dance class and was excited about it! I was a little concerned about my final selection because of an injury, but the saleswoman assured me I could exchange them if they weren't too worn. I wore the shoes once to a dance class and they were just too small to dance in. When I went in to exchange them for a bigger size, I was told they wouldn't exchange them once they were worn. This surprised me. So, I talked to Jamie, the owner or manager, who said she would check things out with her employee and call me back that day, but based on her employee's notes, I had been notified of their no return, no exchange once worn policy. I didn't receive a call back that day or the next.  Even if this is their policy, it wasn't clearly explained, and they didn't follow up. Now I have a pair of shoes I can't wear and need to buy another pair. I won't be buying them there. It's so short sighted. These shoes probably cost them $20 wholesale. Was that worth losing my goodwill and a bad YELP review? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The airport is simply too big to deal with passengers effectively and efficiently. The waits for baggage are unacceptable. The parking is VERY unacceptable and now that the construction is going on to replace the shuttle buses from parking to the terminals plan on an extra half hour just to get from the airport to your car and vice versa. Also expect to pay thru the nose to park.\n\nThe only good thing about this airport is the mall level that provides a lot of stores and eateries to gobble up the long waits you'll have since you have to allow for so much time just to get here which is deep inside the metro area and prone to traffic snarls just to get to the airport.\n\nOh yeah... the free Wi-Fi? Forget about it! There are so many people on their network it crawls so slow you can't get anything done.\n\nSecurity? Better plan on a long wait there too. My worst time was 45 mins. This airport seems to be a guinea pig too many times for new TSA procedures and tests. <|endoftext|>

They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.\n\nOnce you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.\n\nI'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Let me start right out by saying that this review has nothing to do with  food!!!  (Unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers.)\n\nSome of you know me now as someone who LOVES tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that.  \n\nSo we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40's), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the Underground Railway, and a Speakeasy circa Prohibition) and the preservation (it's hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style).\n\nSo we came to DRINK and PLAY, in other words, on a busy Friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry.  We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (Like I said, we weren't here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY.)\n\nAfter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the \""wine cellar\""/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu \""tour\"".  WOW!\n\nIt was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the \""secret\"" cellar, with its curved brick walls.  So we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals.  So, I'm a fan! <|endoftext|>

'Cuz they're HUGE.  \n\nI don't care though, because their food is freaking amazing.  You HAVE to order the pan fried pot stickers - they're the best in town.  They have really good soups and cheap lunch specials as well. \n\nAlso the exterior paint color seems to change every time I go, which makes me laugh.  Work it, Wong's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ohhh the Galleria....  the mall where there is a 100% chance I'm going to find something I want to buy and a 0% chance I'll be able to afford it.\n\nIf I am going out for dinner and a movie though, this is where I go.  They have a great selection of restaurants there, and that movie theater.  \n\nI LOVE Anthropologie but I can neither afford nor fit into their $85 size 0 tshirts.  But I'm all about their jewelry and housewears.\n\nI always stop down at Crabtree and Evelyn, I'm so afraid this place is going to go out of business.  this store is like Bath & Body Works outrageously glamorous and wealthy elderly Aunt.  But let me tell you--their Fresh Cut Rose perfume is literally man bait.  \n\nTheres lots of parking, the mall is beautiful inside, and I do teh bulk of my xmas shopping there because I KNOW I will always be successful there, and I have all year to save up for it.\n\nSometimes they even have luxury car shows, which always makes me chuckle bc I think to myself, \""Isn't that EVERY DAY in the parking lot?\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was having issues with my laptop turning on, some times it would and other times it wouldn't. They were unable to figure out the problem and advised me that my computer had several viruses. Which I found odd because I had someone else already do a virus scan and they found ZERO. Data Doctors wanted me to pay a ridiculous amount of money, on top of what I paid for them to figure out the problem (which they were unable to do)  and he said its very possible that I had 250 viruses on my computer. He stated that this other expensive scan would be able to find them and then if I pay even more money then they can get rid of them. My computer was not even worth the asking price of what they wanted to fix it. I then contacted a friend and I was referred to another shop that would look at it for free....although they couldn't figure out the issue either...they told me that I have absolutely ZERO viruses on my computer. The whole thing seemed so fishy.  DD also did not finish diagnosing my computer in the time I was promised and I  had to keep calling them. They didn't even start looking at it until I was on my way. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Guys. Seriously? This place is not living up to the hype. My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later. \nImagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,\""we need a credit card for this reservation\"".  \""I thought I paid ahead, but ok....\""  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please. \nThe valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.\n\nThe stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would \""disappear in a week or so\"". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, \""I don't care about that, what I care about is...\"" I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place? Spend your hard earned money some place else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So like most Chinese sit down restaurants, all orders are generally meant to be shared so bring a friend. The entrees are relatively expensive and each of them can be shared by two people since they don't give you too much food. I thought that the fried rice was good, but the only reason it was good was due to the portentous amount of soy sauce that was blanketed over it. \n\nI also found it odd that employees were in the restaurant working on their establishment's balance sheets as well as folding napkins. Water is on my top 5 of favorite beverages and I have to say that the water here was absolutely filthy. \n\nPerhaps the worst aspect I experienced here was the server only speaking in Chinese despite knowing that there were English-speaking people at the table. He didn't address us at all and just choose to talk Chinese to the only person in the table to understand it. That was extremely rude and I was quite offended by it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had a family function here and I was sadly disappointed. I felt that the entrees were of average quality , but the service was terrible. We had made a reservation days in advance yet still the staff seemed unprepared for our service. We sat for ages until we finally had to ask for them to take our orders. I believe I asked for wine, then water 3 times as did other members of our party until my husband just started walking up to the bar and basically serving our party drinks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized, no sense of urgency, and spend most of their time eating and chatting in the hall.  You will waste 3 hours in the ER bleeding from a head injury and concussion as others keep gerring treatment.  One nurse said \""oh we keep forgetting about you\""  WTF!   Go here to die! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  2-stars may be a bit generous if we're just measuring food quality.  \n\nQuick-n-dirty review: Stamm House features a lot of character, history, and good service.  Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \""standard-from-the-bag\"" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \""stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\"" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.\n\nGenerally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.\n\nThe \""buffet\"", in its entirety:\nWon-Ton Crisps\nFried Rice\nChow Mein\nMixed Vegetables\nFrench Fries\nEgg Roll Halves\nFried Chicken\nHot Wings\nSweet & Sour Pork\n\nHere in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \""Chinese Buffet.\""  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \""family-style\"" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We really enjoyed our meal there.  We ordered a variety of dishes including curry beef,  egg foo young and Governor's chicken.  Nothing trendy,  just reliable Chinese dishes.  Everything was fresh,  and the beef egg foo young was especially good.  We'd return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend for dinner.  We decided to come here since it was the last of the Big Burrito restaurants that my girlfriend had not tried.  The inside of the restaurant is quaint with a sushi bar on one side where you can watch Mr. Shu ply his craft and many tables on the other longer side of the restaurant.  There are also a decent amount of sheet metal fish sculptures throughout the restaurant which I enjoyed looking at.\n\nWhenever our server came over, we queried him about a few of the Umi specials and in addition to the information about the dishes he told us that they were essentially big appetizers which was good to know.  After hearing that we decided to start off our meals with the sawara with garlic ponzu and squid pasta with garlic sauce.  Since we had also both ordered entrees with my girlfriend getting the terayaki salmon and myself the seafood tempura with a side spicy tuna maki, our meals actually started with a miso soup and ginger dressing salad.  There was nothing special with either although I do always enjoy both at many sushi places. Soon after we finished those the sawara came out and it was a Spanish Mackeral cut into 7 pieces with a tiny sliver of raw garlic on top surrounding the garlic ponzu.  We were instructed to wrap the fish around the garlic and dip it into the sauce which we both did.  The combined flavors were very enjoyable with the standout being the sauce.  After that our squid pasta came out which was some squid that looked julienned and then seared with some shitaki mushrooms and asparagus on top of a bed of garlic sauce.  This dish was interesting for me as I was not a big fan of having the squid in the sauce alone but really enjoyed it whenever I combined it with some of the vegetables.  The Shitake mushrooms might actually have been the best that I have ever had as they seemed to melt in your mouth.  After we had finished the plate our server ended up bringing out a side of rice onto which he poured the sauce from our now empty dish.  In doing so he explained that the sauce was too good to waste.  After trying the sauce covered rice my girlfriend and I both readily agreed with him.  Finally after making our way through all of the other courses, our entrees came out.  My seafood tempura ended up consisting of broccoli, asparagus, crab, fake crab and a single piece of fish all breaded in tempura with a side of soy sauce.  This dish was actually the biggest disappointment of the evening for me for a few reasons including the single piece of fish and also that it seemed to lack the depth of flavors that the rest of the dishes so nicely displayed.  Thankfully my maki was delivered at the same time and had a flavor punch that diverted me from the much more vanilla tempura.  Since I am not a huge fan of salmon I did not try my girlfriends dish but she did assure me that she enjoyed it whenever I asked her about it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely be back in the future.  I am not so sure that I would order an entree again but I would certainly love to try more of their creations and could probably make a meal of their maki and sushi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I saw this Church's Fried Chicken place while filling up with gas at 32nd street.  I couldn't help but try them as I was a Church's Fried Chicken virgin.  My mother used to eat it ALL THE TIME in upper Manhattan in New York City where she ran a store.  I guess it was a quick, cheap lunch, but it had to be more than that as my mother was a good cook who knew how to make good chicken herself.  I walked in for the $2.99 order which seemed cool (two pieces of chicken, one side and one biscuit), but after all was said and done I upgraded to an additional side and an additional biscuit--still a good value for the money.  \nGot home with my chicken in tow, thinking of mom all the way since I was carrying her favorite meal. Wondering if I would like it.  \nMy two pieces of chicken were ample, crispy and not as greasy as I expected.  I have had chicken that begins with a \""K\""  and found it to be greasy around these parts so I was pleasantly surprised with how un-greasy it was.  The biscuits were soft like biscuits should be (not hockey-pucks).  However, they put some type of sweet glaze on it that I would have omitted.  I like my biscuits like biscuits--they are not dessert --they are supposed to complement the chicken.  I would have left that glaze off.  Would I eat them again.  Yup.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  Glad I upgraded to an extra side so now I have one in the fridge waiting for me to dig into it.   So there you have it.  Good chicken, good mashed potatoes and a pretty good biscuit.  Yelpers are complaining about the mac and cheese here.  SO DON'T GET IT. Few places make real good mac and cheese.  And some restaurants feel that they have to add four cheeses to the Mac and Cheese to make it good.  NO, NO, NO, NO.  Use sharp cheddar and make a b\u00e9chamel sauce, etc etc.  (can't give you my whole recipe or you will make mac and cheese as well as I do.  NO CAN DO. I want to remain the Queen of Mac & Cheese in my family!!)   Now you know the real deal---it's the mashed potatoes you should go for when you go to a Church's Chicken.  So despite the complaints by some Yelpers, the \""Boss Lady\"" came, bought and ate Church's Chicken and liked it.  There you have it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You must get the Brushetta and order the roasted bell peppers and goat cheese! One of the best! It is usually pretty crowded and can be kind of noisy but if you know that going in ask to sit on the patio! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seriously, people giving this place high reviews? When we went here last, the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off. And it was somewhat temperate in the middle, confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried, cut, and served. I don't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet (yes, I'm talking about the vegetables and sauces) and mix with pre-cooked meat. That IS NOT good Chinese food. As someone who has lived where there are actual Chinatowns (Boston and San Francisco), I know what very good Chinese food is, and this place certainly is not.\n\nOh, and the lighting. Who said that bright, overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining? \n\nI have yet to find a Chinese restaurant here in the Phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch. If anyone knows of one, please let me know. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Yes, it's a chain.  Is it top of the line?  No.  But the quality has greatly improved over the years and the service as well.  They handle groups well.  This place is always on the list for my office to have lunch.  I recommend it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I lived in Bangkok, Thailand for four years while on assignment for the American Embassy.  While there we were exposed to all levels, including the finest, in Chinese cuisine.  A few years after retiring we moved to Phoenix and, for one reason or another, have been disappointed in the quality of Chinese cuisine found here.  That is, until last Sunday when we accepted a recommendation to try The Gourmet House of Hong Kong with friends.  We ordered several of the soups and entrees.  Prices were reasonable, service was excellent and all items were quickly served piping hot.  This first experience here brought back wonderful memories of the lengthy time we spent in Asia.  Items we ordered were Wonton Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Green Curry Pork Clay Pot, Egg Rolls, Crab Puffs, Kung Pao Shrimp, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Peking Duck and Almond Chicken.  All were authentic in quality and flavor and will most surely be ordered and enjoyed again as we continue to explore the restaurant's lengthy menu.  This restaurant receives our best recommendation. <|endoftext|>

Book a car at a rate and then they give you a smaller car, which shoild be at lower rate, at the same higher rate originally booked.  No wonder they only hsve a 1 star rating.  So much for being #1.  Guess they've gottrn to big and are full of themselves.  Don't bother asking for management.  They are worthless and could care less about delivering a quality customer experience. <|endoftext|>

After that wait today the doctor tells me that there is nothing they can due about my chronic sinus congestion and has me leave after 2 minutes. So glad this is the care we give to our veterans.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I recently visited Soba this past weekend on a trip to Pittsburgh and I have been dying to return ever since. I wish I could get it shipped here to NJ! The food was definitely some of the best food I have ever had. The drinks were all very interesting as well. Very tasty! We ordered an array of small plates to sample various different things. Each one was better than the next. The spicy tuna maki roll was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The tempura green beans were so delicious too! We sampled everything from soup to salad and Korean BBQ ribs. Everything delicious! We even left room for dessert which was equally amazing. My friend had the sesame ice cream with salted caramel. It sounded strange to me at first but it was so delicious. I had the chocolate make which was so beautifully prepared and delectable although extremely rich with the dark chocolate. Definitely something to share because of the richness, I was only able to eat a few bites. My other friend got the pandan leaf panna cotta. After reading it on the menu, I didn't think it sounded like something I would like. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. It was amazing! I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh to visit Soba again! <|endoftext|>

I used Hotwire to bid and pay for the car in advance (approximately $130.00).  The agent turned around and recharged me the amount plus an upgrade fee of about $40.00.  I was pissed off.  Furthermore, they would not help me with the child's seat in the car.\n\nI did manage to contact me credit card company to have the charges reversed and was successful.  Budget did not relent.  They wanted to recharge me the car rental plus an upgrade.\n\nNever again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has some wonderful sandwiches. I work in the building next door so I frequent most of the dowtown (or as they call it uptown) establishments during the week.  They offer Boar's Head and normally offer a daily or weekly special.  This place gets a 2 b/c they have the worst customer service, the unfriendliest staff, and got a 94.5 on cleaniness rating. Although the sandwiches are good its not worth having some lady bark at you for your order before you can even see the menu.  They need to hire some people that can smile. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A long term consignor, I didn't really keep track of the items I brought in, or the individual amount received for them.  I donate many things to charity, but take the more expensive things here.  Well, I took a necklace, Honora pale green, freshwater pearls in their leather pouch into MSC. I paid $185 for them and had never worn them.  I was paid $7.50 for the pearls!!  It is my opinion, when there is an item one expects to sell for at least $85+, they should let you know, before giving them away for peanuts. I was not happy, although an employee called me after my inquiry as to what happened to the pearls.  I think with designer clothes, one is better off sending them to The Real Real. They pay 70% and shipping.  From now on I will donate all other items to charity and take the donation receipt, rather than feel as if I had been \""taken\"". The staff is friendly for the most part, but many do not know quality when they see it, and reject things that would sell and are valuable.,The store is well organized, and I'm sure if you buy anything, you'll get a great deal-especially if you bought my pearls. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a review for their Sunday night trivia.\n\nThe beer specials are pretty good, I have to give them that. $1 Miller light and High Life pints, plus $3 red bull vodkas. The host is funny and they give good prizes: $10 off your bill for winning a round, $50 for winning the night. Pretty generous.\n\nTrivia is a cross between the way Boltini's and Canopy does it. 6 rounds of 10 questions where the host reads the questions and you write the answers down on sheets of paper that you turn in. 6 max per team; you pick your team name. Team names are not as creative as Boltini's nor as vulgar as Canopy, but in time they may be. It is faster and better organized between rounds than the meandering cluster of Boltini's, possibly because the geographic layout, possibly because the skilled an efficient host. There are breaks for bathroom etc. \n\nSo why two stars? The format needs significant tweaking. The first question of each round is worth 1 and the last 10 points. IMO, they should all be worth one since trivia, by nature, is worthless knowledge. Why should some worthless knowledge be more highly prized? Why should one team that gets 9 answers right lose to a team that got only 6 answers right? The #10 question is not necessarily tougher than #1 for everybody, and even so, should missing one question cost a team almost 20% of the points for a 10 question round? This problem is compounded as points rack up for the final calculation. Really, this scoring makes the night about luck: if you know the bigger point questions, or do really well in a particular category, you will win, even if you get less ?s right.\n\nAlso, the strict adherence to narrow categories doesn't work. A good category might be 'ancient history', but not 'the 2nd Punic war'. The time I went, there were 10 name that hair metal band from listening to a clip and 10 questions about former World Cup champions and host countries. Unless you had a really deep knowledge (10 point question: name every single team to ever win the World Cup) of both these somewhat arcane topics, you are basically screwed out of competing for the overall prize.\n\nLastly, I ordered the gazpacho. It was bad. It was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers. Not a soup but more of a raw salsa with large chunks. <|endoftext|>

It feel weary, and wrinkly and sun beaten, much like those old women who look like gila monsters who stayed out in the sun too long during their youth.  The airport layout is confusing with the terminals all in a straight line and piers off those terminals at odd places.  \n\nIn order to get from terminal to terminal, you need to walk.  They do have moving walkways, but people refuse to walk on them.  I hate these people.  Or worse, they don't walk, preferring to amble or perambulate their slow ass down the rubber highway.  I have a limited connection time usually and I don't want to get stuck here, so please move faster.  \n\nI fly US Airways, and this is their sorriest hub.  Inherited from the merge with America West, it doesn't even feel like a hub.  There are no flat screen monitors for flights waiting you when you deplane.  Instead there are a few monochromatic CRT displays that look like they went with my 386 computer back in the day, running DOS.  SimCity what???\n\nSo I don't like it here.  I'm not sure what they can do to make me like it, but a better way to connect terminals would be a start. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I brought my partner to Upstream for his first visit.  We had a table in the middle of the dining room.  I love the look and decor of Upstream (especially the ceiling!) so this felt very cozy.  The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level.  There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen.  I understand (and enjoy!) the concept of \""open kitchen\"" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants.  The open kitchen didn't feel right for an upscale seafood restaurant that can/should be used for special occasions and dates.  \n\nAnyway, we had fantastic service.  Just be prepared to enjoy an hour and a half relaxing meal.  To start, we tried the bento box appetizer, which was a combination of different things (sashimi, sushi, beef, eggroll), but I think next time I would go with just a couple of sushi rolls.  We also splurged and added the flash-fried calamari as it sounded so good when our server was describing it to us.  And she was right.  It was very tasty and not at all chewy. It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes.  The only disappointing thing was the portion size.  Good thing we got the bento box, too!\n\nI ordered the sea scallops for my entree and chose the Japanese ponzu sauce (there are 5 choices!) to go with it.  The three tennis ball-sized scallops had a LOT of flavor to them and the fingerling potatoes on the side were tasty, too.  Again, though, the portion was pretty small, but with all things added up, we were full by the end of our meal.  \n\nAll in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, but I can't say that when thinking of places to go in the future, I'd return anytime soon.  There are so many other options out there and Upstream didn't \""wow\"" us enough to return time and time again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. \nFinding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. \n\nOpening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! \n\nOf course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! \n\nI quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. \n\nYou can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. \n\nThere are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...\n\nI get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. \n\nI open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. \n\nToo hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? \n\nI was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? \n\nThe tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! \n\nSome restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. \n\nI did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. \n\nI can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! \n\nIs this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? \nNO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. \n\nBathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. \n\nWould I return? \nNo but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well i admit this place is Awesome \nLove the Damn big azz burritos! \nLove the Quesadillas with chicken or steak. \nThe soft tacos and crunchy tacos or the best. \nAnd the salad, uyyyyy the salad with the sauce is the SHET!!!! love it. \n\nYes the parking lot is small, but its worth the walk from the parking lot across it. \n\nThe ladies there hook me up , cuz i speako El espanol, LOL \nYes I'm Mexican damn it!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Prepare to be wowed. \n\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My parents have always talked about the Pleasure Bar and how they used to go here when they were younger, but I have never been.  I have got to say that after going, I am defitiley a fan.  Nice portions, good food, and classic Italian enviornment.\n\nWhen we got here, it was a pretty long wait, but luckily they have a pretty rocking bar here equipped with many TVs and plenty of booze.  Once we sat in the classic Itlaian looking dining area, our waitress came over, and we were starving.\n\nThe greens and beans were delicious.  I was suprised to find out it was only made with lettuces rather than traditional escarole, but it was delicious.\n\nEntrees were also great.  I ordered the half portion of salmon, so I can account for portion size there, but it was great!  Asparagus was delightful.  My parents both got a pasta dish, and there was plenty to share because these plates were packed.  \n\nI would definitley suggest this place.  You know it is a good deal when my dad gets the check and his first words are, \""That's all?!\""  So with that being said, it is pretty affordable too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seriously guys, adding a bunch of spices to cooked rice with lamb is NOT how you make biryani.  Oh, and who places green bell peppers to biryani?  I'm not sure what I was eating but with each\nbite, I asked myself loads of questions:\n\n\""Is this what I paid $13 for?\""\n\""Why did I pay $13 for this?\""\n\""Why am I sitting in my car, on my way to the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, eating this spice flavored rice with\nnot lamb?\""\n\""What is this big black thing that looks like a beetle.  Oh, its just a cardamom?\""\n\""When I asked the guy who gave this to me for some raita (Indian yogurt condiment), why was he \nsaying that was going to be extra when it is always customary (and FREE) to hand that out with the biryani?\""\n\""Should I finish this or no?  I need to finish this, I paid 13 freakin dollars for this - that's why!\""\n\nThen, the cycle of questions would start all over again and if that is not torture, I'm not sure what is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My favorite dry cleaning in the area. I live in Scottsdale but I make the drive back to my fave spot in Arcadia. My family and I both go here and we have never had any problems with our clothing. I tend to do same day pick up anywhere so my clothes aren't piled up with others and get creases being shoved in after days. I picked up my clothes here after 2 days because I forgot about it and they looked phenomenol. Perfectly steamed and they got a stain out of my blouse. Awesome dry cleaning and friendly staff that has been around for some time. Keep up the great job guys. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've used Hertz since I was old enough to rent a car, but I'll never go back after this experience. I initially spoke with an agent when I first arrived at Hertz. I specifically told her that I was going to add another driver. I received a slip of paper that said, in bold print, \""TOTAL ESTIMATED CHARGE.\"" I then gave her the information about the second driver, after which I received several more pieces of paper.\n\nI later found out that one of those slips was a second contract that said, in small, faint print, that I had to pay $13 for each day with a second driver. If I had known that I wouldn't have added the second driver.\n\nThis is clearly a rip off. Hertz should have printed a revised total that stated the updated price IN BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS, like they did with the original price.\n\nI found all this out when I dropped off the car. I talked to the manager, who was obnoxious and unhelpful - she basically asked if I could read. I called the 800 # twice and got even more discourteous service. (They never responded to an email I sent shortly after the incident.)\n\nHertz succeeded in ripping me off for an extra $100 or so. But they've lost my business for good.\n\nDon't get scammed like I did. Avoid Hertz and go with a reputable company instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cool place.  Definitely worth checking out.  You can find some things here you wouldn't find anywhere else as well as some delicious fresh baked bread.\n\nNow it seems you can only shop here 3 times before becoming a member.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love Carolina's. Just not yesterday, November 11th, @1:45pm at the Mohave St. location. Just to be sure. \n\nNow, it's not my fault I only have 30 minutes for lunch so I went to Carolina's at the Mohave St location and I ordered a taco and enchilada, both beef. 14 minutes later my food arrived. The place was not crowded and that's too long for a taco and enchilada.  My God, there's 10 people - minimum - in the damn kitchen...\n\nSO SLOW AT THIS LOCATION. This horribly slow service has NEVER occurred at the Cactus or Sun City locations and I've been eating there for years\n\nThe taco was delicious, the enchilada not so much.  Three small cubes of beef in the whole enchilada!  The corn tortilla was old and tough. Or very tough and old. There was lots of gravy (red sauce) which is good, but not to cover the less-than-minimum amount of beef. It's not a beef enchilada if it doesn't have any beef. \n\nBut the really bad news is the food made me ill: 90 minutes later: Cramps, diarrhea.   And I've got a cast-iron stomach so it isn't me it, was the food. \n\nSo let's review what we learned: slow service, 1 hit 1 BIG miss on the $8 taco/enchilada/soda they-ain't-giving- anything-away package , that, oh, by the way, made me ill.  thanks for nuthin'!\n\nNever again this location.  You either if you're smart. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best BBQ in madison. The best night is Thursday. All you can eat chicken and ribs. Their coleslaw is the vinegar oil kind. Not creamy. I love it. Some of the staff has worked there for years - a nod to this awesome locally/family owned eatery. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Did someone actually refer to the salsa as Ketchup?! Oh hell no!! The salsa and chips are by far the best I have had in the valley. I was surprised this place got such mediocre ratings. I have been going here since I moved to the valley and it's always reliable.\n\nThe location is great because it is so different from anyplace else; Mexican or not. Tucked back of 16th st in a more residential area, the patio is great and there is always room even when it's busy.  The service is always good and then there is the chips and salsa. I don't see how anyone can knock it, it's always fresh. The more pico inspired salsa is chunky and has a good amount of cilantro. The hot red salsa is more of a paste but more authentic and delicious with some heat. The flour tortillas chips are always warm and delicious. Most of the time I load up on chips so much I just get a Tostada and a beer or house margarita. \n\nWhen I used to eat chicken and dairy the chicken chimi fundido was something I always went for. I get the veggie burrito on occasion now but that isn't anything great, it's got plenty of veggies but nothing to write home about(if my home was in Mexico). The veggies in it aren't what I think of when I think Mexican, it has carrots, cauliflower, etc in it. No peppers, onions, etc.....oh well.\n\nI would just give it 3 stars if I didn't love the chips/salsa and location/ atmosphere so much. That bumps it up a star in my book. \n\nSalsa is like ketchup? Seriously? Sorry...I can't let it go.\n\nOh yeah, for awhile in 2008 every time my girlfriend and I went here it seemed there was always a wedding party, high school reunion, or other annoying large group gathering. In 2009 we haven't seen as much of it but be warned, you can usually still dine, but half the place is reserved and you have to deal with horrible band or MC music and exhaustingly obnoxious people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not much to say about C 3 gate except yuk and gross.  Old looking and outdated carpeting and seating.  You better have some good shoes and good wheels on your suitcase.  The carpet was ripped up in places and it doesn't allow for efforlless pushing.  You must pull your bag if you need to get around quickly. \n\nReally?  You put a food vendor right next to the men's bathroom??  It's already tight enought trying to get in/out of the bathroom as it is with those small doorways.  You have to wait and let the other person pass or your either bang into each other or your luggage will get all caught up.  Stop building trams and restaurants and build better/bigger bathrooms.  \n\nNow for the coup de grace:   DISGUSTING - especially since I saw a number of men who came out of the stall and didn't wash their hands.  When I came out of the bathroom, two of them were standing in line to get food at California Pizza Kitchen.  Really?? all I could think about was their germ/bacteria laden hands toucing napkins/utensils. Even the money that might have been used to give me change.   CPK?  you need the location/money that bad? \n\nThe seating areas (at least for this terminal) are few and cramped.  I've never seen such self righteous fliers who think their bag deserves a seat  when other people are standing or looking for seating.  Ugh.... SKY HARBOR - Epic #Fail! <|endoftext|>

An obviously premade frozen hamburger, fries of the sort I can buy at Safeway, and prices that are higher than any one of my beloved restaurants where it's all fresh?  No thanks.\n\nI ate lunch here today, as it's in my office complex.  The place itself is actually pretty cute and seems like it would be fun to grab a few beers after work, which is why I gave it the two stars.  But every other restaurant in the complex would have to close down before I'd pay $10 for anything on Deemo's menu again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great truck stop restaurant.  I've had breakfast and dinner here and it has always been good.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  The bakery I guess is legendary.  They have doughnuts the size of your head!  Eclairs the size of your arm and Cream Puffs that are about 10\"" high.  On our most recent trip in the area, stopped at the gas station attached to the restaurant fo some quick snacks and of course BAKERY.\n\nIf you are driving by and see the sign for The Pine Cone Restaurant - Take the next off ramp and stop it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I haven't eaten here for many years (decades).  Was looking for a place simiilar to Skipper's Fish & Chips (NW - Seattle) chain.  Was hoping that I could find the fish similar; it is the breading is very simlar to what I remembered; since I used to work there in the 70's; early 80's...Tried the seafood platter, Clam strips were good, coleslaw was fresh and not overly sweet; fries were fresh and didn't taste fishy; but the fish, the fish is what will bring me back again & again.\nREVISED - Okay, this is becoming a staple in my diet.  Have been there probably once a week for the past 5-6 weeks!!! <|endoftext|>

Now I realize this could easily happen, however she didn't bother to tell me that she lost it.  Finally after her being gone 20 minutes with my card, we found her and asked her what the delay was, to which she responded \""did I by chance give you back your credit card?\""  My first thought was TELL ME RIGHT AWAY SO I CAN CALL THE BANK!!!!!!!  I told her that and her response was \""I know, but I was so embarrassed.\""  Luckily, they found our card eventually, but if someone else had found it, they could do a lot of damage in 20 minutes with all the shops around there.\n\nAs a side note, during our LONG HORRIBLE experience, two other groups came in and left after about 20 minutes of not even having a waiter/waitress say boo to them.  I wish we had seen their experiences before we ordered.\n\nI wish 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it! <|endoftext|>

After speaking to managers, teachers, etc. we were given promises to work with her more and that she would be advanced to the next level within a few weeks.  Weeks turned into months and it never happened, but they were sure happy to take our $80 a month without any questions.   We put her in another swim school and she has advanced 2 levels within a few months.  Would not recommend this school to anyone.  They handled our situation very poorly and it was a waste of money. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If there is one thing in this world I hate, are fricking know-it-alls!! I ordered a fuel pump from Autozone in west covina, not that long ago, IT FAILED ON THE WAY TO PHOENIX AZ this new years \""weekend\"". Where to start......\n\nI called the store I usually deal with here in Pasadena, He gave me this Autozone's phone number, and told me that they handled commercial accounts, and had the fuel pump in stock. I called, and Tara answered the phone....EXTREMELY NICE GIRL!!! THANK YOU FOR YOU HELP!! (hence the one star).\n\nGranted this autozone is damn near 25 miles away from where we were staying, and my buddy drove me over there. When we got there, Tara was really quick to help us out...but then...out of nowhere, comes this \""commercial Manager\"" I think his name was Tom....I told him of the problem I was having, and telling him that this was the second time THEIR fuel pump had failed...\n\nwhat it was doing, was not marking correctly how much gas my truck had....I filled up the tank with 80 dollars, and it told me that I had 6 miles to empty....we would start to drive, and maybe 15 minutes later...it would shoot up to half a tank, then....5 more minutes, it would shoot all the way up to full!\n\nHERE'S WHERE IT GOT DICEY, THE FIRST THING HE DID, WAS SAY TO ME...\""OH, THE FUEL PUMP IS GOOD, ITS PUMPING FUEL RIGHT? \""yes\"" THEN THE PROBLEM IS YOUR TRUCK, ITS NOT READING THE SENDING UNIT ON THE FUEL PUMP!! CHECK YOU WIRING, OR TAKE IT TO A CERTIFIED 12 VOLT SPECIALIST!!\n\nHELLO!! WTF DO YOU THINK I AM!!! I DO 12 VOLT FOR A LIVING BUDDY!! DAMN NEAR 15 YEARS!!! \n\nSo I started to explain to this know it all, that its not the first time it has happened, it happened once before, and logically, its not possible...my OEM fuel pump failed, because the pump went out.....not the fuel pump sending unit..\n\nWhats happening here, is that Autozone is selling 2nd hand products, I am never buying from them again...and as for Mr. Know it all...my buddy, who was with me, is a 28 year mechanic, I have been a 12 volt installer for 15 years....next time, just shut the hell up and sell me what I need. I understand you want to stand behind your company, but I wasn't there to argue with you, I was there to get my damn truck fixed so I could come back to California....\n\nJust a quick update, both of the fuel pumps, that i bought from autozone, came apart inside my gas tank....the first one, came out in 4 pieces, the second one came out in 2....what kind of crap are the selling over there....if this pump fails, I think a lawsuit is in order, I can't be dropping my gas tank every 6 months because of this crap!!! NO BUENO AUTOZONE....\n\nMy commercial account is going to buy anything from you either!!! <|endoftext|>

I love this place. You come out feeling like James Bond. I've done the MW thing and the mall thing like Nordstrom. If you are a grown man you should have yourself a tailor. This is a family run business and they are proud of that. It was so nice to see. If Peter takes care of you. He will take GREAT care of you. I thought me and this guy were the same age he was so professional and mature that I was surprised to find that I was 7 years older.

Fat, old, bored, and heinous looking moms and meth-heads giving not-so-discreet handjobs to shifty patrons... nobody tipping at all (which begs the question, \""why do they come to work?\"")... and an overwhelming cloud of depression and angst looming over the whole nasty parade.\n\nThe place was surprisingly active for a Wednesday afternoon. It took several minutes for my eyes to adjust to the darkness - I imagine keeping it so dark can only help given the sorry state of the girls. There's no VIP room that I could tell (unless you count the shabby bathrooms), but that didn't stop the shenanigans going on out in the open for my virgin eyes to see. There were definitely men being \""gotten off\"" here which disgusted me to no end. I have no idea how much it costs, but it can't be terribly expensive (and yet it's surely too much). \n\nAnother possible \""up-side\"" to this place (depending on your perspective) is that they will serve you an illegal amount of alcohol... the law be damned. This is perhaps another aid to help make the beasts on stage easier to stomach. \n\nSpeaking of stomachs, Eric was right - there were definitely some very pregnant ladies here. Kinda disturbing. My friend decided she wanted to get a dance from either the oldest girl or the fattest girl in the joint. The girl she picked put her mouth on my friend's vagina through her pants and did some sort of heavy breathing and moaning... my friend looked mortified and all she could do was let out some uncomfortable  panicked laughter. She was also groped and molested beyond her comfort levels. \n\nNothing in here was sexy at all - it's basically a really dark and moderately scary dive bar with a bunch of whores walking around with their ugly boobs out willing to do whatever for a few bucks. These girls clearly don't make much money (unless the special services pay well)... my friend and I would tip 5 bucks to the stage dancers (and their center stage is a joke) and they would thank us with a surprised look as though it had never happened before. \n\nThe seating looked like it was purchased from a conference hall at the Ramada Inn that was shut down 10 years ago and the girls looked like they wandered in off Van Buren 10 years ago. I suggest you stay away, however I can attest (as Eric P pointed out) that this was a source of some amazing comedy and laughter... hence the extra star.\n\nEdit Dec 2014 - \n\nI feel bad about saying \""whores,\"" \""fat,\"" \""ugly boobs,\"" \""heinous looking,\"" and \""beasts.\"" Those are ugly words and I wasn't raised to talk like that - I was just trying to be funny. Also, I regret not mentioning that someone brought in some shrimp cocktails in styrofoam cups to sell. Like, where the hell did they come from? He came in through the front door. The regulars and bartender acted like it was a normal thing for a dude to walk in off the street selling seafood in a dark, dank strip club. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> All be it a small venue, The Visulite is quite a nice place to catch a show. The have good beer prices, especially for a music venue. They also have decent bathrooms and plenty of room at the bar.\n\nThe stage is a little small but on par for the venue. It has a pretty cool design and good lighting. The seating is not that abundant, however there is plenty of standing room, especially right next to the stage.\n\nI have seen quite a few great shows here and I would say it's an all around fun time, each time. Also if you're early for a show, go get some good tequila and the 1900 restaurant down the block. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good good ol' Armadillo Grill. It's been years since I used to frequent this place during my car biz days, back then I used to come here for their \""Armadillo Gold\"" wings and CHEAP happy hour drink specials. This review will focus on my most recent experience here. \n\nI came here because I was looking for a reasonably priced healthy meal at 1 am, a virtually impossible combination to find at this time. And I got exactly that, a hearty blackened chicken salad with fresh greens topped with a generous amount of moist and savory chicken. It was very good, and for about $10 it's the only place I can think of that I can get a quality salad this late at night let alone for that price.\n\nIn addition to the food which is surprisingly good for a bar, they have very attentive and friendly service. I always leave 'dillo feeling well fed and like I got my money's worth. This establishment has made it's self synonymous with quality food and value in my book and earns a 4.5 from me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just when you thought your kitchen was stocked, one visit to Williams Sonoma and you will think otherwise. I've always enjoyed this store, as they have so many fun gadgets to make your at home culinary experiences so much easier. My husband and I registered here for our wedding, and there's nothing more fun than shopping for all of the quality kitchen items they offer with someone else's money. Not only is it fun perusing all of the items in the store, but the extra enjoyment comes from the delicious samples they always have. \n\nWhat's also great is that they offer free cooking demos every Saturday. I went to the one last weekend, and learned how to make fresh pasta and then got to sample it! The staff here is always very accommodating and helpful. I will return many more times for that kitchen item I never thought I needed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I come here all the time and I think this is the poorest quality HD I've been to in the valley.  \n\nAsk someone for help and 99% of the time you hear \""This isn't my area I can't help you\"".  Why don't they just put that phrase on the buttons they wear?\n\nYeah they have just about everything for your fixer upper projects around the house, but the service blows. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very swanky place, kind of reminds me of Blue Fin in Atlanta.  It has a very modern design to it with nice wood floors and metal sculptures of fish hanging from the ceiling.  It's all very impressive.\n\nThe food is to die for as well.  A great wine selection and food cooked to perfection.  The signature dish is the lobster, but I've always liked shrimp better.  It's a very nice experience to try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Considering the high reviews on the Web, this restaurant must be under new management... Every ingredient tastes like it came out of a can, nothing tastes fresh or homemade. Every type of meat was dry and tasteless, while the beans, rice and produce felt like they opened the cans days before. Luckily, meals are inexpensive... The meal wasn't terrible, but easily forgettable. I can't think of a reason to dine here again considering the caliber of restaurants in the area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I Asked for a Mount and Balance from them and had a good laugh.  I buy my tires from the Tire Rack(online) and Goodyear quoted me $154 dollars just to put the tires on!\n\nI'd Highly recommend Kirby & Kale in the Elizabeth Area. They did the same service for $40. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place was awesome. Tons of awesome memorabilia all over and great food as well. They even had an Elaine Benes big salad on the menu from Seinfeld. A great place to go when you're downtown especially before or after an event. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of my commitments over the past year and into 2011 has been to shift more of our dollars toward local businesses. Sure, I still buy stuff online and at some national chains, but I've also made a conscious decision to look for a local alternative wherever I can. \n\nWhen it came to printing new business cards for my husband's business, instead of taking advantage of the super cheap prices and free shipping from Vistaprint again, I turned to the directory on the Local First website for some guidance. \n\nI found a few local printing companies and contacted them all via email with a small introduction and a request for a quote for this relatively small project.\n\nSusan from Impact was the first response I received - long before others' responses started trickling in. After receiving quotes from various companies, I did a little bit of price comparison, and asked some of the companies a few more questions about recommendations for the right paper, about file types and fonts, and about turn-around time.\n\nWith regard to price, Impact wasn't the \""cheapest\"" but they certainly weren't expensive. My quotes from a total of six companies ranged between $27.00 to $75.00 for comparable quotes: 500 cards, two-sided, full color on one side, with an aqueous coating.  Impact quoted me $55.00. Four of those six companies quoted comparably.\n\nSo what made me go with Impact? By the time I had finished all my comparing and asking, I'd had several email exchanges with Susan, and every response was so thorough and so friendly and so above-and-beyond, that I didn't really care. She won me over with excellent customer care.\n\nChristmas came and I fell off the map for a week, and you'd better believe she picked up right where we left off and was very understanding! \n\nYesterday I picked up the finished cards. And it wasn't enough that the cards turned out excellent. They close at 5 and Susan patiently waited for me after closing time, as I fought traffic on the 51 and then on the suicide lane on 7th Street so that I would be able to pick up the cards in time for my husband's business trip. \n\nSome people may say, \""meh... big deal. that's what they SHOULD do...\"" But the truth is, it IS a big deal. I don't meet this level of customer care too often. So, when the product is great and the customer care is unmatched, the choice is obvious as to who will get my business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Lived in 405 E White St, champaign for half a year. It was totally a nightmare, I am soo glad I will move out tmr. When we moved here in August, JSM forgot to remold hot water tunnels in our bathroom, we had to take showers in ARC for three days. There was no window screen for a month, we pushed the office several times and they came up with several excuses. There was even a crack in the wall, they fixed it in Dec, however, maintainence left their knife in my bed... The WORST is, they have bedbugs. Although they did pest control once, but we found a bed bug in bed recently. Anyway, never resident in 405 E white! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First I want to say I LOVE coffee & I don't even understand the people writing reviews on here that DON'T drink or like coffee!!!!  So please look at the reviews of actual coffee lovers!!   I LOVE the Fortunes Coffee's.  We don't live there but stumbled into this place while walking down the Strip District.  I bought their Pumpkin Spice coffee & brought it to my son's house there to brew.  It was AWESOME!  So I had to go back & buy plenty more of both reg & decaf.  Now everytime we go back to Pittsburgh we have to go there & stock up.  If you want good tasting coffee, get it there!  The people there are very nice & helpful also!  I am drinking a cup of their coffee right now here in Florida & about to order some on their website!  YUMMY!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In general, I am not a fan of Shadyside bars. Le Mardi Gras may be in Shadyside, but it is something else entirely.\n\nMardi Gras is a true dive bar, and not just compared to what's around it--this would be divey in any neighborhood. Drinks are cash only, there's a perpetual haze of smoke, and you'd better be an expert at navigating dim lighting if you hope to not trip over anyone. None are especially bad things. And in fact, the pros of Mardi Gras far outweigh these things. Great big booths, friendly bartenders, free wifi, and strong drinks.\n\nSpeaking of drinks: are you into fresh-squeezed juices? Do you like strong drinks? I mean really strong. Play it safe. Try a Greyhound, but make sure you have a designated driver. The bartenders almost take pride in the strength.\n\nAll in all, it's an authentic dive in a neighborhood that sorely needs one. Grab your cash, and bottoms up! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was stop #4 on our night uptown/downtown.  I paid $8 for small plastic cups of John Daly which is ridiculous.  However, my friend bought a blue Panthers shot, and they gave me a free one because they said I had to drink one too which was nice. It was all right, but I could have spent the entire night at BlackFinn instead! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The service was good. Ill give them that. Their cheese steak sandwich was terrible. Meat and cheese and bread and a hint of sauce. Ive had a better chese steak sandwich arbys. The bread was great. The meat was over cooked and seemed like it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Barely any cheese and almost no sauce. Try somewhere else for a chese steak. Paid $8 for 9 inches of bleh. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well, this is probably going to be my last AZ review for a very long time.  Expect a slew of Seattle reviews instead. :o)\n\nTaylor's Cafe was pretty awesome despite the fact that we had a little trouble finding it.  It sure is tucked away in a mass of twists and turns of pavement and stucco.  In any event, we found it and it was relatively busy.  Since there was only two of us we were seated immediately right by the door.  I kind of expected my waiter to be douchey just because of the location and the way he was \""styled,\"" but he was actually pretty awesome.\n\nAfter running through the menu I kept finding omelets that were almost exactly what I wanted, save one or two ingredients.  When our waiter came back and I told him my dilemma, he told me to just make something up.  Sweet!  I ended up ordering an egg white omelet with asparagus, mushrooms, and cheese.\n\nThe food came out faster than I expected and I was certainly not going to complain about that.  Obviously my omelet was close to perfection because it was exactly what I wanted at the moment.  It was delicious and HUGE!  I couldn't even finish it!  To make a lovely breakfast experience even better, my Diet Cokes were continually topped off without me having to ask.  Now that is service.\n\nI would totally come here again, if I still lived in AZ, but the location is kind of obnoxious and the dining area is a bit cramped.  Overall, a really great stop for breakfast. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish they could give negative stars.  I mean seriously this place is a health violation.  I have eaten Mexican food on the streets of Tijuana and almost never has it been this bad.  Gordan Ramsey needs to put this place on kitchen Nightmares.  Honestly, I joined Yelp just so I could post a review of how bad this place is.  I am not even joking when I say the marg tasted like it was made with a mixing powder like Koolaid.  I have never, ever, ever walked out without finishing my food.  I can say after 4 bites we were out the door.  Help others and warn them that this place is toxic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This review is mostly of the water park...\n\nWe were there yesterday nice and early!! By the end of the day this place turned crazy!! Sooo many people were there!! We got there by 10 or earlier and walked around in the kids area so my nephews could go on some rides before we headed over to the water park. At this point it was still pretty quite and nice!! \n\nWe went over to the water park area a little before 11 to wait to get in, we walked over and the line was short but getting longer. We had decided we were going to get a cabana over in the Wave Pool area so we can leave our stuff and the kids could go and relax if need be. It was only $54 to rent it out for the day, Perfect!! The Wave Pool was so nice an quiet for a while, but I'm not sure what happened because all of a sudden it was a mad house!!! So crazy how many people were in there! The lifeguards had lost complete control at this point, life jackets were just floating around in the water, kids weren't even using them anymore, someone's hair extension floated by my sister (gross) it became complete chaos!! Thankfully we got there nice and early so the kids could do things like the water slides without much of a wait and even to get on the lazy river we waited a few minutes but nothing like we would have if we were there later in the day!! \n\nWe had grabbed 4 lounge chairs in the front of the wave pool so we could lay out and relax it was a great option to have those or go sit in the Cabana. Again the Cabana would be good if you had an elderly person with you because it has a TV in it so they too could relax instead of having to just sit there!!\n\nThey're is PLENTY of people watching going on and all in all we had a great day we were there for almost 7 hours so we were all tired and let's say some got a little sunburned....me :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Initially the Customer Service from the woman who collects the items was wonderful, and the price was great for what I was having cleaned!  However, when I picked up my items, 2 of my shirts had yellow and brown stains all over to collar and top of my shirts, so I sent those back, and took home the rest of my items. When I got home, 2 pairs of pants had been shrunk (tighter through the leg, slightly shorter inseam). Both of these had been dry cleaned before (at another location) and did not shrink. 4 weeks later I am still waiting on my other shirts. I have called and was told that the stains cannot be removed, it must have been my cologne, and that I would have to take them back to the store I bought them from and claim a \""manufacturer defect.\"" This is completely unacceptable. Neither shirt has been worn more than 7 or 8 times each, and both have been dry cleaned before, and I always wear cologne, and I have never had this problem. They refuse to do anything about it. I have been given the run around on the phone, but am basically being told it is my fault that they ruined my shirts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Capital Grille was a great experience overall.  The staff was extremely welcoming and courteous.  I had let them know it would be a first date experience and they pulled out all the stops.  They chose a very romantic table setting and the service was terrific.  The waiter was a little overly friendly and was a bit uncomfortable toward the end of the meal.\nThe setting, environment, and welcoming staff were the highlights.  For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good.\nFor the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.  Still, a VERY good cut of steak.\nThe meal and a bottle of wine ran me $150 which for the service and ambience I believe is fair.  I'll most definitely be going back to give the chef another chance to WOW me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is hard to find in this crazy plaza, but the food makes it all worthwhile.\n\nThe Herb O'Vores Tacos are one of the most delicious things I have ever had. I've had them twice in State College and once here. I was tempted to try something new on the menu but our waitress said you can never go wrong with the tofu tacos and she is right. I didn't regret it one bit. I can always try making my own thai burrito or spicy buffalo wrap at home.\n\nYou get three tacos filled with fried cubes of tofu which have been tossed in a light sweet General Tso's type sauce topped with bean sprouts, a green salsa with avocado and served with lime wedges, rice, and black beans. So delicious and it all came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.\n\nI love reading their menu. The Mex-Asian dishes all sound awesome. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come often to try everything.\n\nThey also have Daiya cheese and vegan cheesecake always on their menu. How sweet is that?\n\nMy only complaint is that we went just after 5 and it was so dark in the restaurant I could hardly see the menu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Too expensive for what it is.  I had the ham and cheese flat this morning and it was the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my whole entire life!!!

In the midst of my rush, I realized I forgot a leash for my 80lb retriever. I figured it wasn't a problem since they have leashes in the store.\nI walk in with a squirmy puppy in a dog carrier bag on one shoulder, while trying to walk my 80lb dog by his collar. I walk up to the grungy-looking cashier and say, \""I'm so sorry but I was in a rush and forgot my dog's leash at home. I am just going to the Vet Clinic, so can I please borrow one?\"" Clearly he sees I have both of my hands full. The jerk says, \""No, but they might have one back there for you.\"" REALLY? \nI was previously warned by a couple family members to avoid this place like the plague, but I thought I'd give them a fair shot. \nI will never recommend this place and I will never return. This place has forever lost my business. But I will always recommend the place that is just a few minutes away with wonderful customer service! <|endoftext|>

I've pretty much been to a couple of games - and had the chance to sit in different areas of the stadium.  I think the best was when I got invited into a private box, but it's hard to get back outside after that.\n\nThe stadium also hosts college bowl games as well.... and I think a few concerts.\n\nSure all the newer NFL stadiums are great, but I think Bank of America Stadium is still pretty modern and growing in charm.  Not sure why people are wanting a new stadium since this one is already good - we'll have another Hornets/Bobcats scenario with our tax dollars hard at work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ehhh... Kind of expensive for what you get. Burgers are soggy and the fries taste like they are cooked in old oil.

Also the dining room is pretty much standing room only for lunch. No thanks. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst leasing office! First of all they wrote the wrong rent amount on our lease. When my roommate and I went together to sign the lease there was a temp working. We initialed and signed. Then the office calls us back to say they gave us the wrong lease and to come back to sign new with correct amount which was $40 higher. Are you kidding me? We refused to sign new lease and this is there mistake. Called corporate office and they assured us that we are right about not having to sign a new lease. \n\nAmong other small issues about the apartment, They had an insect sprayer guy come to spray all apartments. A couple weeks later they called to confirm our \""bed bug treatment\"".. WTF! We said no one ever informed us the inspector found bed bugs! They said someone was suppose to call us. I was in Cali at this time freaking out! They were treating tomorrow. My roommate and I were furious no one notified us of this! They gave us a list of how to prepare for treatment. I came home that night late and trash bagged EVERTHING I own! We had to clean out kitchen cabinets and moved all furniture to center of rooms. I told them I know we don't have bed bugs since I have never been bitten! Next morning insect spray guy comes to our apartment that I had to take time off work to be there. I went to leasing office to ask if someone can help move my bed and they look at me confused stating \""he's only going to spray, not treat\"" I looked at inspector and he said he never said we had bed bugs! No no bed bugs... WTF 10xs.. The leasing office just look at me like Oh Well. I got no apology. I called corporate again. Nothing they can do. I had to get all my clothes out of trash bags and put everything back! \n\nLastly I was told I'd get my pet deposit and gate remote refunded at moving out. I only received one check in full for the remotes. I called and spoke to manger and she said she will mail the pet refund and also said our last water bill was taken out of this check. Fine. I never got a check! For months I called and manager tells me I was never due a refund for pet. Seriously! I called corporate again. Of course they don't deal with money issues.. \n\nThis place is has made me feel absolutely taken advantage of. It was incredibly stressful to feel like you have bed bugs and no one told you. Thankfully we didn't but thanks Ingleside for the suffering and not apologizing. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have had dogs my whole life and have been to many different Vets around Scottsdale and Phoenix. I got a new puppy in July and a friend recommended Dr. Bracken so highly that I decided to go instead of taking her to my regular vet. I signed her up on the puppy plan which is great when you have a new puppy. It includes all shots, nail trimmings, visits and a discount on spaying. Dr. Bracken is the sweetest, most caring vet I have ever been to, he takes time to teach you puppy training and answers any and all questions you may have.  I have since taken my two other dogs and transferred their medical records to his office. You can tell on your first visit that Dr. Bracken's office is very busy but he is worth the wait. He loves dogs just as much as you do and isn't driven by the all mighty dollar that so many other vets exude. I would trust his honest, straight forward opinion over any one else!!!!!! I normally don't write that many reviews but if you love your dogs as much as I do, you'd taken them here! <|endoftext|>

I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was definitely not busy but there were a few tables and the bar area seemed pretty full. The two beers that I had were decent but not amazing. (a hefeweisen and an IPA) Four Peaks Brew House is much better in my opinion. \n\nThe service was awful. Nothing good or personable about it. Considering it was not very busy I expected more out of someone, anyone for that matter! (maybe they were angry because they had to work on Halloween) My drinks took longer than normal to receive and my Kobe burger took quite awhile too. I wasn't keeping track of the time but how hard can it be to throw a burger on the grill and fry some fries? I was expecting more from this \""top seller\"". Not impressed and I will not be returning, if the beer and food were amazing I might come back even if the service sucked but if all three of these important factors are not up to par I will spend my money else where. Next time I'll take the extra 10 minutes to get to Four Peaks.\n\nAlso I noticed the menu was really, really random. They don't specialize in any particular type of food. Fish and chips, and then some southwestern dishes....? Whatever, I appreciate small, local restaurants but this place is all wrong. Plus the staff doesn't seem to care much for their jobs so they must not care much for good tips! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place!  I live out of state and recently called Elizabeth Arden for a gift certificate for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.  I have done this annually for her for several years and she had always loved the service.  I must admit that I was going to go to a less expensive place this year...cut backs and the economy.  After reading reviews online, I selected a nail spa close by.  The service was really horrible on the phone.  I can only imagine what it would have been like in person.  I ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to Elizabeth Arden again.  Yes, I spent twice as much for her mother's day present...but I would rather pay double verses deal with poor service and questionable product.  When my mother-in-law comes here she is always happy and feels pampered on her special day.  And they really do gift certificates well.  I will not shop around again!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went there for a afternoon lunch on a Saturday. It's really clean and the staff were welcoming an friendly. The food was great and the wine was wonderful. This is a great play for foodies or a now brunch with the girls. They have the items on the menu in the store which is a huge plus. Coming from Chicago where there are several now restaurants I would recommend this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I always use PreFlight for my airport parking.  They are fast and reliable with safe facilities - in the shade or not, your choice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  THE RULES:\n\n1. To buy or be helped with anything, you must check in with an \""orange shirt\"" - this person has the clipboard and will write your name down with the reason for your visit. \n\n2a. If you have questions or want to buy something, you must then wait for a \""blue shirt\"" to come help you - expect at least a 5 minute wait\n\n2b. If you've made an appointment for the \""genius\"" bar, you must wait in back for your name to be YELLED out by a \""genius\"" in a black shirt - expect at least a 15 minute wait (If you haven't made an appointment for the \""genius\"" bar, you'll probably just get laughed at)\n\n3. If you want to purchase an item, a \""blue shirt\"" will check you out with their hand-held device, when available. (There is only one \""register,\"" a computer pos system located at the \""genius\"" bar, but it's use is \""not encouraged.\"") If you bring cash or want a bag, expect a longer check out because those are kept somewhere else, of course. Receipts can be emailed to you, printed out, or both.\n\n\nI wish I would've known these things before my last visit - I would've gone elsewhere or just gone online. Can't tell you how much I hated the experience. I guess the setup is good if you're someone who needs a lot of assistance, but for someone with a simple purchase or quick question, the hassles and hoops of this store isn't worth the inconvenience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> love their drinks and they have good food. the staff is friendly and take out is prepared correctly and quickly. Costco has gift cards that cost less than the face value so you can really get more bang for your buck! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The buffet is wonderful.  A wide assortment of Indian food at about $10.00 per person.  The chicken dishes are simply terrific.  They also provide bread on the table and a fountain drink for $1.00.\n\nThe decor is inviting and the staff are nice.\n\nI recommend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is by far the best Chinese food in the valley. The pan fried noodles and sesame chicken are AWESOME!!!! I eat here at least once a week. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The rooms were clean and comfortable with a view of the mountains. The staff was exceedingly friendly. I especially appreciate how one woman at the front desk helped me plan my daily 5 mile run in an unfamiliar city. I also think the hotel did an excellent job accommodating my business meeting. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Yet another great hole in the wall joint. They have awesome pulled pork sandwiches. This place is a local classic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  \n\nVisit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.\n\nWorst experience at a restaurant... EVER! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A nice quiet airport with plenty of shopping. The womens restroom has a bathroom attendant and is very clean <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> great hotel for the price. the rooms are more like a boutique hotel with mid century modern kind of look and feel. decent breakfast and friendly staff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hit this place up since this place was a local spot and I always wanted to see if it was one of those \""hole in the wall\"" type of places. Yes, it was a \""hole in the wall\"" type of place, but no the food wasn't amazing. I ordered 2 of the 8 piece wing dinner, and well to me it just wasn't spectacular. The wings came out wings, but lacked any sort of taste in it. I honestly don't know what the hype was? I guess it was cheap. It came with 4 rolls, but they only gave us 3. \n\nAnyways, this place is marked and done. I won't be coming back here anytime soon. You'll have better luck at Church's Chicken or Bojangles with better chicken compared to this place. However, this place does have burgers and other menu items. But, come on... Chicken King restaurant, and you're not going to try the fried chicken that they named the restaurant after? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\n\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\n\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \""this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\"": shelves are only about 4'6\"" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\n\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  McDonald's is McDonald's. My \""beef\"" with this place is they stopped selling ice and I prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wearing pajamas! \n\n(See http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-restaurants-phoenix-44#hrid:jpfxQUBZMuBoIIFn-MWp7g) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Bruschetta here rocks! Hands down..Ive never had anything like it.. ALL of the bruschettas are great .. my least fav is the Tuscan bean.. Im just not a fan.. The Fig & Mascarpone is more of a 'dessert' than a app...:-) I havent had a bad wine there yet, either. Postino is  always trendy and fun... great date place... :-) Always crowded... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love the melting pot! Everything from the drinks to dessert were amazing. I tried the white peach Cosmo... Very good! My boyfriend had a bells two hearted. Our dining experience started with the green goddess cheddar cheese fondue. Next course was salads. My boyfriend had the spinach mushroom salad while I had a Caesar. Both were super tasty. My caesar had pine nuts on it. Loved the added crunch. Next course was entrees with assorted proteins... Chicken, beef, salmon, tuna, & shrimp. My favorite was the tuna but everything was delicious. Mine and everybody's favorite course is dessert. We got the snickers chocolate dip. Why this isn't on the menu is beyond me. Its great with bananas. \n\nGood food + good service = good times!\n\nWe will be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went in here around 12:45 today and the place was packed but the service was still good. I waited in line for less than five minutes, ordered, and waited less than ten minutes to receive my food. They handle the lunch rush with ease. In my opinion, the food in general is overpriced but that's the same at any location. It is literally right off the lightrail, which is super nice. I usually go to Subway by campus but stopping here might become a regular thing for me now. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hours listed on Yelp last night shows Mi Amigos closed at 11pm. A group of us ,driving 4 separate cars parked and paid for parking at the Arizona Center. We arrived around 10:25pm and were all told they were closed. When we told them about the hours, they said it was for a different location.  The food here is just gringo Mexican anyways and service is sub standard but they listed they were opened and others showed closed. I won't  be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stayed at the Pennsylvanian for about a month in one of the Corporate Apartments.  This place is old.  I believe it used to be a hub for trains and buses.\n\nThe outside looks nice but the hallways to the rooms look a little dingy.  There was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub.  The washer and dryer was old.  There was rust on some of the door hinges.  The dresser, fixtures, coffee table, dining table, and dining chairs looked new and modern.  The carpet for the most part was clean.  The sofa looked old and was not comfortable.  The bedsheets had yellow stains on them.  I did not use the comforter and one of the layers.  The Pennsylvanian has a maid service option with 1 week or 2 week intervals.  I am not sure if they even changed or washed my bedsheets because they all had the same yellow stains?  wtf?\n\nThe views from the apartment is nice, but the windows are hard to see through since the window screens are dirty.\n\nThe kitchen is ok.  The corporate apartment comes with a fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots and pans.  There is also an iron and ironing board.  There is also a 22 inch? CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels.  I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay.  The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me.  They did not offer me a chance to pay for it.\n\nThe fitness room was nice.  There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines.  There are even a few sets of dumbells.  I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that.\n\nThere is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly.  There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company.  You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned.  This is rather expensive as well.  Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.  Thieves could come in and steal your clothes.\n\nIf I had an option, I would not stay at the Pennsylvanian again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Conveniently located on the way in to the movie theater, my mom and I popped in here for a snack to smuggle in to the movie. Nothing makes my mom happier than a good bakery, but actually nothing here looked great to me. Perhaps it was the time of day?  I think we stopped in at about 7pm.\n\nI settled on a big chocolate chip cookie that was WAY too sweet.  Like, inedible.  \n\nMy mom loved her danish thing that she ate the next morning, though.  And service was very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I didn't particularly care for the food, but I loved the length of the vegan menu and I can't wait to come back and try the rest of it, even if it is just to be disappointed.\n\nWe waited for about a half hour and were seated likely as the last Friday rush made its way out. I had the sweet potato hash. I couldn't taste much besides the sweet potato, and even that was masked by the heavy spices added to the top. I wouldn't order it unless you're really into hash. The apple pie \u00e0 la mode was solid (as in yummy, but also as in not runny). Prices were good, service was attentive. Remember to check in with Yelp to get a free coffee! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best cigar selection in Pittsburgh. Their pipe tobacco blends are fantastic, I recommend RLP-6. Great atmosphere! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Impact Printing is an amazing local family-owned printing shop. As a designer, I know from experience that a lot of projects are very tricky to produce and the final result depends very much on the production crew. These guys are the best. Time after time they made me and my clients very happy. I would recommend them for any printing job, and especially so to graphic designers looking to get their work done right, with attention to detail and with great care. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My fiance took me here for my birthday in August. We were immediately seated, so far so good. Then our waitress took forever to come to our table and bring our drinks to us. We weren't feeling good about this. Then she brings out the wrong entree for me ( or she put the order in wrong) so we pointed this out. She apologized and took it back and we thought we made a mistake coming here. My fiance didn't want to eat his, finish and wait for me to get mine but what else were we to do? We were prepared to leave a poor tip and a complaint after we finished but before we could decide what to do, the manager came out and apologized profusely. He immediately understood that my fiance didn't want to wait so he kept his plate hot while they made a fresh entree for me. Also he insisted that both our meals be on the house as well as free dessert. We weren't looking or expecting a free meal, just an apology, but it was awesome that he came out and addressed it before we could lodge a complaint. That's proactive and we appreciated it. Mistakes happen but as long as management attempts to make it right, which they did here, means we will be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went at lunch, so it was a little crowded for my liking, but that's to be expected. Despite how crowded it was the service was excellent and I very much enjoyed my HUGE breakfast burger. Reasonable prices, cute, local place. Would definitely go again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm not a fan of mexican restaurants that have crappy salsa and chips. Sorry, it's just a standard by which I live by. The chips were nothing special and did not taste freshly made (closer to store bought which wouldn't be a surprise). The salsa was 95% water which is a bummer. We had to ask for extra because there wasn't much substance. \n\nI ordered the sampler platter dish which came with a little bit of everything. The taquitos were yummy, but that was about it. I smothered most things with guacamole to make it edible and left about half the plate. My friend had the tacos and seemed just fine with them.\n\nThe service was awesome until we were looking for the check to leave. Then we had a hard time finding our waiter. If you like Taco Del Mar you'll be satisfied, however I expected a LOT more out of a mexican restaurant in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  UPDATE!  \n\nEver since my last review where I described being backpack violated for carrying rice cake contraband, I've made it my mission to sneak in as much snack contraband as I can every time I go here.  \n\nToday I stopped at Walgreens before heading over to the theater, and bought 3 large boxes of candy for 3 bucks!  Yes!  The same candy in the same size boxes that they sell at the theater for 4.25 a piece!  That's a 9.75 savings to me Eastgate, and YES I like stuffing boxes of candy down my pants!  I like it!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nuh uh. Nope. No no no. My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago. Her birthday, her pick. Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. \nBut, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. \nWhen our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, \""That's what medium well looks like\"" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.\nAs a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.\nStill no drink refills.\nNo one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Gross, disgusting, rip-off. This place makes me seriously doubt the Madisonian palate. I had a cheeseburger from here a few nights ago. I asked for medium - which to Monty's means completely raw in random spots. Aside from the random rawness, the burger tasted like it was over seasoned with pepper. The meat was of absolute shit quality, the bottom bun was soggy (probably from undercooked meat juices), and I did get it to go. Thanks for the ketchup and mustard packets - now that's classy. I have no reason to set foot in this place. Every experience I've had up to point makes me wonder why I bothered to return one more time. Maybe there's something wrong with my palate, but to be honest, I'm pretty certain that there's not. East side institution? What a joke! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm sure if I drove far enough outside of Minneapolis I'd find a place about as awesome as the Green Lantern. Instead of doing all of that work, I just wish the Green Lantern would move into my backyard.\n\nI HATE bars where I feel like I have to do a lot of work just to try to have a good time. I'm not dressing up or drinking a certain drink just to feel like I have a shot of being accepted somewhere, believe me. The Green Lantern rules because it's completely laid back and totally unpretentious. I've seen such a wide variety of people there and everyone is always having a great time.\n\nBesides, the drinks are super strong and cheap - that alone is good enough for me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. \nWe sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. \nThere are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The food, atmosphere and service are always top notch. Recently, a delayed order put their customer service to the test and they passed with flying colors. They were prompt informing us of the issue, ensured we were comfortable (and fed) during our wait and just really took care of us before, during and after our meal. They went above and beyond expectations for customer service. I highly recommend Hillstone and will be returning soon. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love our arenas! Seriously, we have amazing sports arenas and this one was too! I had nice seats which always helps. I am not a big fan of all the stuff they do at games with dancers and contests and mascots, but whatever, you have to put up with that crap. I don't even like basketball that much but the stadium was really nice and clean and lots of selection on food and drinks-which is important to ME! Lol. I was upgraded to one of the suites and the suite was very nice too. Highly recommend meeting someone that has suite tickets and then get them to invite you up! Bathrooms clean, staff very helpful. I look forward to going again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Perhaps my experience left me feeling bitter simply because I was not aware that you are supposed to cook your own steaks.... Wait, restaurant... cook my own food????\n\nMe and my dad went here because we were hungry for a steakhouse steak, but imagine our surprise when we walked in and our waitress explains how the restaurant works.  Oh, you can have the house chef cook the steak for you, but its $3 or something extra.... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me...  Well, we didn't come to cook, so we bit the bullet and got the chef to cook our food.  \n\nBut putting aside the whole \""cook your own steak\"" deal, the restaurant was still very poor to me.  The prices are absolutely ridiculous.  Every entree was above $20 and we didn't exactly get a ton of food.  My platter was a medium sized steak, a small baked potato, and a very small serving of veggie mix.  The salad bar was very poor.  Very limited selection, and the food looked old and wilted.  \n\nOur waitress was rarely around the whole night, and we even were placed on a side of the restaurant with barely any people.  This was especially troublesome based on how we were never given silverware, needed drink refills, and more napkin quite a few times.  Still, our waitress was never around.  \n\nTo be honest, most of the people in the restaurant weren't even eating...  It was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks.   Not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least. \n\nAll and all, I won't be going back here.  Food wasn't bad, but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced.  The service was bad at least on the night I went, the salad bar was very sub-par, and most of the people in the restaurant were just there for drinks.   I can't get into the \""cook my own steak\"" deal either.  Hell, I just would have stayed home and made my own steak for a 1/4 of the price. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Had lunch there today. Waited for about 5 minutes for the host. Then walked to the bar area looking for someone to seat us...no bartender.  After all that I was ready to never come back.  But the trip was saved by the service of our server.\n\nI wish I could remember her name! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been there twice and enjoyed the food both times. First time there I had the Shrimp Boil. VERY Cajun (spicy) but very good. Second visit I had the Crawfish Boil which was excellent. The other person in my party had the Crawfish Etoufee which he said was very good. The service is a little slow but all the wait staff is very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had to downgrade my rating after last night's delivery. I received a free delivery coupon from Delicious Deliveries so we used it for dinner. There weren't a lot of options in my zip code so we settled on Macayo's. \n\nWe started out with the green corn tamale bites. I didn't care for them but my hubby seemed to enjoy them. They also gave us a big bag of chips with sides of salsa, pretty good as I stated in my previous review. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the steak fajitas & I ordered the carne asada burrito (with rice & beans added). Hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross. The bottom was so soggy I couldn't eat it as a whole, just picked at it & threw a lot away. For dessert I ordered the flan & since our order was over $30 we got a free dessert as well so I chose the mini chocolate chimis. The flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good. \n\nTotal with tip & free delivery was about $50. We won't be ordering here again...I'm pretty much just done with the whole food delivery service thing after 2 expensive, not so great meals. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Okay, I came back, based on my previous experience.  This time, I stayed in a 6th floor room, overlooking the main road and right across from the NASCAR museum.  As noted by another reviewer, these rooms catch A LOT of street noise.  If you are a light sleeper, be sure to bring ear plugs, or ask for a quiet room facing the other direction.  My first stay here, I had a suite with a separate bedroom.  It was very quiet and nice for sleeping. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'll keep it short: \n\nAwesome atmosphere, inexpensive drinks, cheap tickets to see great live music. All around a cool venue and a great time. I can't wait to go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i know, I know--Olive Garden, how pedestrian of me! I don't have too many chain restaurant reviews, so I figured I'd write one. We went for a surprise birthday party. My friend had made a reservation which they somehow didn't have (maybe she called the wrong one? Anyway, I'm not going to dock for this). The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice. \n\nWhen we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend \""Do you smell that? It smells like...\"" to which he replied \""wet dog!\"" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. \n\nOnce everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. \n\nDessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent. I'd stay away from this garden like the plague, though. <|endoftext|>

I've had several cakes done here, and have never been disappointed. One of the most beautiful & most memorable was an Ariel cake for my daughter, complete with chocolate pebbles that made up the bottom of the ocean. With an assortment of fillings to choose from (my favorite is the raspberry), the cake is always moist and delicious! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've never stayed at a hotel that charged me BEFORE I even checked in.  Then charged my card again after I asked them not to (I'd be paying in cash) because I couldn't avoid another over draft fee.  If I ran out the door and tried to stiff them, yeah, by all means, you have my card on file.  But charge me TWICE before I even attempted to check out?   I've never been to a hotel this sketch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't think I can ever buy pastries any where else. There selection is amazing. Nothing better that a coffee & a scone to get me through the work day. There cheeses are also really good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My kids and I love this place! The chicken biscuits are out of this world. So far I have tried the Captain Fantasy (talk about a kick) and the Bumble Bee (made with locally sourced honey) both have been fantastic. I have also had the Carol which is Kilt Lifter braised pulled pork on a biscuit, smoked in the back of course. \n\nThe service has always been really friendly. The atmosphere is really laid back.  You will want to eat outside, as the inside is really small.  Pretty much the opposite of the Tardis (a little geek joke, nod if you get it).\n\nMy Step son recently got one of their burgers, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  Definitely on my list to try soon.\n\nAll in all, its a place you have to try. You will not be disappointed in any way. oh did I mention that they are locally owned and locally sourced? So not only can you get good food, but feel good about it to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also, the toppings were not greatly blended, just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust.\nI work right next door, but wont go there again.\nI usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted, so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This used to be a great company to work with. The products were made well and the service used to be outstanding. Now buyer be ware. I have had nothing but headaches with my orders. First was with the drapery order I placed in July. My drapes still are not up because of one debacle after another. First some of the hardware didn't arrive, then it came in the wrong finish, then the didn't include as stated drapery hooks and they are back ordered till Jan. 2014. Then hung a pair of drapes and the other pair for another window in the same room wasn't the length stated, then I called to have the right length sent. Oh sorry mam, they have been discontinued you will have to take down the pair you just hung and order something else and by the way it is going to cost you an additional $200 dollars. 4.5 mos. later I am still dealing with their screw ups. Ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack. A friend and I worked on this for 3 hours, it should have taken no more than 30 min. We could not get it together because it didn't line up. Sorry mam, you will have to pack up this very large and heavy item and set it out to be picked up. Have spent a lot of $$$$ and would have had better service and products had I gone to Walmart. They used to be a great company, I have been brought to tears and all I have gotten is a smug and condescending attitude. When I complained to one of the online managers and explained my disappointment with he had no sensitivity to all I have been through and at one point even tried to point the finger back at me. At one point told him I would be telling everyone I came in contact with and the internet media how horrible my experience has been, his reply \"" Do what you have to do!\"" Wow, were has customer service gone? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I recently stopped going here after 4 years. I was prescribed a birth control pill and not told about the side effects, which landed me in the ER for a week.  I talked to the office afterwards and was told it was my problem, and not the doctor's job to advise me.  Yet I still went back, this time for a hysterectomy consultation. I made the appointment approx. 2 weeks in advance, arranged for time off from work, etc. I arrived and paid my copay and waited nearly 20 minutes, only to be told that the office girl had screwed up and scheduled me with an NP instead of a surgeon, even though I was extremely clear about what I was coming in for. I demanded my copay be refunded and left. I do not recommend this practice at all! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cactus Flower never disappoints.  The flowers are beautiful, fresh and fragrant and last longer than those purchased elsewhere.  The staff really knows their stuff and is always helpful and friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite commercial movie theater.  The biggest draw for me is 1) location and 2) hot cinnamon and sugar donuts!  They always have a large selection of movies due to the many many screens.  A big plus is that, unlike the Point, they take debit cards at the ticket line AND at the treat counter.  Make me wanna buy lotsa candy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day, and ordered the \""famous\"" lobster roll.  It took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast.  THATS IT!  Oh and less than stellar fries, with a cup of cole slaw.  I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...I guess you can't get it right every time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why are the prices increasing as the competition disappears. Ever since circuit city went under the prices went up drastically. I also don't like when the push the extended warranties. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I banked at B of A for years. Then we noticed that they were getting bigger and bigger and dipping their fingers in all different kinds of enterprises. It seemed that they were making their customers their last priority, while doing a lot of shady deals to boost their bottom line. It reminded us of that movie \""The International\"" from a few years back. B of A is so big and powerful, it wouldn't surprise me if they were manipulating countries to start wars in order to profit from them. We grew disgusted with everything that they stood for. Which is why we started banking with Desert Schools. Desert Schools has a long history in the valley, and we've known many people that have been satisfied customers for a long time. Switching all of our direct deposits and auto-debits was actually easier than I thought. We just had to peruse our bank records to see the recurring transactions and make a few quick calls to those companies. Desert Schools has also made some technological strides even in the few years that we've been banking with them. They have a great mobile app and their ATMs accept the envelope-free cash and check deposits. If you need to go inside and talk to someone they are relatively quick, whether you're talking to a teller or an account specialist. I had an issue a few months back where a cable company in Florida debited my account for another customers bill. I initially thought it was fraud, so I called Desert Schools to inform them. Within minutes of placing the call I was talking to a live person in Phoenix and he was securing my account so another transaction from that company couldn't go through. With B of A, or another bank of that size, I guarantee that it would have been a half-day process for the same situation. If you want a local, personal bank that can do all of your banking efficiently and technologically-forward, then Desert Schools is a good way to go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \""steak\"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We're in a huge bind right now. I haven't been able to find full time employment, my mom lost her job, and my brother doesn't make a lot. Due to our situation, we're limited finding apartments because of income. We have to move this weekend due to really high rent at our apartment and our apartment manager recommended apartment finders. I submitted the form online and Kevin called us back. I have never spoken to someone so rude in my life. We were looking for an apartment on a bus line convenient for my brother and I to get to work. I work in South Phoenix, and he acted as though I don't know what the commute is like. I am well aware. We didn't want to live south and felt we could do better in the northern part. I got a lecture about the apartments we searched and I looked into them because of the prices that were listed on their website. You'd think apartments would list correct prices to avoid wasting time talking to people, but I am now aware that they mislead people. The worst point during this phone call was when Kevin assumed I'm stupid. I have a lisp, but that's it. I don't have some mental impairment. In fact, I have a bachelors degree I earned with a 4.0 GPA, my graduate school GPA is a 4.0, and I have membership into two international honor societies. Telling me that you're going to speak \""really slow\"" is just uncalled for especially when your question was just to ask where I work. \n\nIn the end, Apartment Finders wouldn't work with us because we don't have a car and don't know anyone who would take time to help us with transportation.  I don't think I need to be treated horribly over the fact that things are really tough on us and we turned to a business that is supposed to help you. I don't need to be treated poorly because I finally found a job and just haven't received a paycheck because I started two weeks ago. I know that I'm going to tell people to steer clear of Apartment Finders because of the way my mom and I were treated over the phone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was my first experience at Lidia's and it was amazing.  It was a rare evening out for my wife and I and we enjoyed our meal immensely. \n\nThe food was very good...3 to 4 stars at least.  We ordered the pasta Trio and the creativity behind the dishes was very impressive.  The only thing taking away from it was the execution on the pasta itself. The fettuccine was cooked well past al dente and bordered on soggy.  The ravioli however were perfect And the flavor profiles on all the dishes were spot on\n\nThe reason I gave a five star review on 3 to 4 star food was the service. Everyone without exception was very attentive, friendly, helpful, and generally awesome.  This team could've served hot dogs and it still would've seem like an amazing experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible service. Had to ask for refills. Waitress disappeared. Had to ask someone to find her. Food quality has diminished from what it was. Thought I would try them again. Not coming back. What a shame. It used to be a great restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service, but I felt like the food was just \""okay.\""  Nothing to brag/boast about.  Prices are fair.  Maybe so many groupons because not enough people are raving about it? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have tried this place 4 times. The food is not very good. I have lived in Thai Land but don't expect to get the same excellent food here. I love Thai food and Thai people, don't think much of this place, I live close by but go elsewhere. The food is bland, overcooked and pretty Americanized. I have always been pleasant, patient and courteous but never gotten good service. The servers are lazy and sometimes rude and you are going to wait a longtime for every step of the service process. With so many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix there is no reason to eat here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I liked it. The food was pretty good and the wine and beer selections were great.  It's definitely more of a happy hour spot for me though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We ordered carry-out and after getting it home called them to say they left out portions of the order.  We were transferred three times and after talking to the third mouth-breathing Tween hung up.  Won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tried takeout yesterday. One of the worst Indian meals we have had in a long time.\n- Lamb Kabobs - undercooked and falling apart. They may have run out of time or maybe they had too many takeout orders. No excuse. A big F for this.\n- Chicken Makhni - C minus. tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish. Very small portion. \n- Saag Paneer - C+ The paneer tasted rubbery. Good flavor though.\n\nOne can understand, this is Charlotte and thus not a Indian food destination. But the miss on simple Kabobs clearly show a careless staff. Charlotte deserves better.\n\nIn my opinion, a waste of money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dr. Riley is very nice.  I don't know how much he truly \""hears\"" me, but I think he tries.  The office manager is a different story.  I had a visit in early 2013 and reported difficulty breathing.  The doctor was supposed to call in an inhaler.  Two days later, nothing had been called in.  I followed up and was again told it was called in.  Went to the pharmacy (verified location) and they had received nothing.  I went back a few months later for stomach virus symptoms.  The initial visit and mishap was totally disregarded and not even \""remembered\"" for that matter.  I had to pay another visit shortly after because my symptoms were not getting better.  Nothing was done, and I spent about 5 minutes with the doctor.  I was told it would get better on its own.  Now...  Since September, I have had an open balance with this office, and I SHOULD have called to pay it sooner.  Having said that, I can also say there is no justification for the message left on my voice mail by the office manager.  It was downright rude and condescending.  She was shaming me and bringing up my place of employment.  I was totally shocked at how unprofessional her message was.  Needless to say, she got what she wanted...  but I will not go back to that office...  the mediocre service was semi-acceptable; however, the office manager's disrespectful and inappropriate behaviour is totally OVER THE LINE. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really, whats not to like?  Well, read on. . .\n\nThe downstairs bar is nice and cozy with a fire going and a copper bar top.  This is exactly the type of place I loved to go to back home in the winter when it was snowing outside.  The bartenders are super friendly.  The small plates are $5 during happy hour (although their drink special happy hour and food happy hour don't overlap) but like Melissa said you have to sit directly at the bar.  (Not next to it, not across from it, AT the bar.)  If you're one of those people who don't like small plates because you need to shove a ridiculous amount of food in your mouth, this is your place.  The small plates all had very generous portions, especially for $5.  \n\nThe name Rokerij comes from a set of cafes in Amsterdam, so this restaurant is a \""smokehouse\"" (haha) that specializes in steaks and other grilled meats.  If you venture to the restaurant upstairs you are overwhelmed with the wonderful smell of grilled meats.  We had two small plates with beef tenderloin and they were both great.  Even the seafood dishes were very good - scallops, crab, shrimp, ceviche (though it was not a traditional ceviche and was a little sweet).\n\nThere were two things not to like.  1- The couple sucking face behind us on the couch.  I don't understand why grown adults have to act like teenagers in restaurants.   2- The roach that was crawling across the bar that my husband had to kill.  To thier credit, the bartender was grateful and thanked my husband for \""looking out\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped in yesterday to try out something new. Wow it was amazing. We made it in after lunch and was pleasantly greeted. The decor reminded me of the kinds of Mexican restaurants I ate at 15 years ago very traditional. We had four dishes cheese crisp, machaca chimmy, sour cream taco, and rellendo(my Spanish spelling is horrible). \nEverything was amazing and the tab was only $30 dollars. The server was super friendly and professional, I will be back many more times!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went into ER with abdominal pain left there five days later after unexpected surgery. Every person I encountered were kind and helpful and professional.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mediocre Italian food. I had a pizza and it was quite bland. The waiter was nice, though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Now, this theater is not a place you go to watch 'The Fast and the Furious XII' in 4D. It's an old-school 6-screen movie theater, where some of the screens have about 30 seats and smell pretty old. It does have stadium seating, it doesn't have an arcade.\n\nPark Terrace runs independent and foreign films and has a certain charm that is lacking in most theaters in this region (Manor Twin excepted). Like the Manor Twin it is owned by the biggest of movie theater chains, Regal, but it looks much like it has since it opened.\n\nMy wife and I have been to about 30 movies here, and have never been disappointed with the service. The food isn't the best, there aren't many options, but sometimes the popcorn is pretty good.\n\nInstead of getting a snack here, we go to the great Good Food on Montford down the road for dinner. Other times we go to Flying Biscuit and get a light meal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  FOOD: Mediocre, Menu is pretty extensive for a small Chinese Joint, basic Lunch menu for under $6.  I typically come here with my co-workers and we do it family style.\n\nSERVICE: Mediocre, not too much too complain about, generally nice when ordering\n\nAMBIANCE: Dive (x3) inside and out, same goes for the parking lot.  While its a pretty small place, they do have tables that can accommodate a group of 12.\n\nCONCLUSION: While the FOOD and SERVICE is a respectable 3 and 1/2 stars, the overall dingy appearance inside and out brings it down to a 2-star.  I have noticed a bug crawl up one of the picture frames one time in the dining room.  I have not been back since. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Loehmann's is where I generally like to shop.  I love the prices.  I love most of the clothes.  They have cute bags, hats, perfume... all kinds of stuff.  Unlike Last Chance, you won't find competitive boutique owners fighting over used goods just to take a seamrippper to the tag and add their own.  You won't have to deal with the smell of urine in the dressing room like Buffalo...  There are only a few privet dressing rooms but there is a huge changing area for those not-so-modest gals.  It's always a good experience.  And they give you the hangers to take home... It's the little things really. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible.  The food is bland and boring.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, but that doesn't make up for the complete disaster of a meal that we were served.\n\nI really can't overemphasize how bland everything was.   Don't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pharmacy: They only have 1 person staffing this location. Takes more than 30 minutes to fill a Rx. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sure the building is somewhat pretty. With their big glass walls, their cozy cafe, and their different seating options. However, that doesn't make up for the rude service. I completely agree with the reviews that say the professionals that work at this library are very anal and strict for NO. GOOD. REASON. \n\nThey are constantly hovering around groups. If they notice that your feet are crossed in the slightly way that might be touching their precious couch cushions or chairs, they will come over and rudely tell you to reposition yourself. I had the heel of my foot sticking out of my sandal and a librarian came over and rudely glared me down and told me to put my shoes back on.. They will make it point to let you know they aren't pleased with you. \n\nA community public library should be friendly and open, however the staff her can be described as downright rude and anal for no apparent reason. The library is slowly losing it's funding and not making much profit. I now understand why. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great location but not the best value.  Tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug.  Noisy guests had a party - we could hear the door slam as our beds were positioned on the wall of the hall.  Poor design.  Security finally broke the party up at 1:30 am.  Lots of other hotel choices in the area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow. \nThis place sucks.\nHonestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess. \nA hot mess.\nHow are they staying open?\nMy arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade.\nWe split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs) \nThen we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill.\nThe crust was fair.\nThe server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth.\nSo for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22 \n??? Costco Pizza would have been better.\nBleh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here because of the Yelp reviews. i have a new car and this was my first car wash and wanted a hand wash so as not to scratch the car. I found the service pretty good. The only thing, when I went to pay, the woman seemed more interested in helping the person on the phone than answering my questions. I had questions about their window tint service. That is why the 1 less star. But overall, the first experience was pretty good, thanks! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We ordered the \""California Vegetarian Burrito w/ enchilada sauce.\"" Took two bites and asked for our money back. Seemed like the strategy was to hide the taste of old food with onions.  The enchilada sauce was dark brown and had mystery chunks in it, and tasted burnt. \n\nThree times the price of Taco Bell and half as good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me tell you about my experience at the Harris Grill, I know I have eaten here before, years ago. So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar, first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky, then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \""Filth\"" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). \nThe restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )\nLet me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \""Oh\"" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. \n\""PS\"" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well, I finally know where Rito's is. It's in the hood, surrounded by scary shit I don't like. \n\nWent to Rito's for lunch (don't think they are open for dinner nor would I go if they were) on the day after super bowl and every creepy tattooed head cholo in the neighborhood was there. I was freaked the hell out through my entire meal wondering if I should really be there. I grew up around these people, in Maryvale, and regularly go to Sunnyslope and have no issues. Maybe it was the fact there were no other white people nearby, and I was in the middle of a residental neighborhood, which made me feel as though I had walked into some gang's territory. \n\nI was still able to eat my meal though. I ordered the red chimi enchilada style. OH SNAP! That was the best chimi I think I have ever had. The food here is not eally cheap perse, but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything. I wholeheartedly felt that I would go back on a regular basis if not for two things 1) it weren't in the location it's in and 2) it weren't so high fat.\n\nAt least go try it once, and take CASH. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen, just so you know. We had to stifle a sneer when the waiter tried to push dessert on us. I have had their cheesecake before this, and it just isn't very good.\n\nWe are also huge fans of The Big Bang Theory, and since Penny works there, and Sheldon will actually eat there, how bad could it be? Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre.\n\nI had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as \""fine\"" but otherwise unremarkable.\n\nSorry, Penny.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hablas espanol? No importa!!!!  If you want cheap, gringo-esque  Mexican food served by friendly folks, Don Pedros is your place.\n\nFirst, they serve freshly fried tortilla chips with homemade salsa (lots of cilantro).  \n\nThey have lunch specials for $4.  And I don't mean Taco Bell-sized portions either.  Everything they serve is hearty.  If you don't mind the calories, get the chicken chimichanga.  Its a fried tortilla, stuffed with chicken, and covered with chesse, guacamole, and sour cream.  They serve enough rice and fried beans on the side to feed about three people.  Every meal is finished by sopapillas-fried tortillas with honey, cinnamon, and a dollop of whip cream.  Muy rico!!!\n\nWhen I worked nearby, I ordered takeout alteast once a month.  It was usually read in 10 minutes or less.  A typical entree is around $8.  They have a second menu with specialities and authentic Mexican dishes.  The wait staff speak English well, so nothing gets \""lost in translation\"" when ordering. <|endoftext|>

She knows what she is doing and will make u crack up (if u want to chat, if u want to be quiet that's ok too) while u are there. She is professional and knowledgable. My skin glows after she does microdermabrasion and exfoliates my skin. She does complimentary consultations and will not try to upsell you at all. After building your skin relationship with her, u will not be able to quit. Go ahead. Call her. <|endoftext|>

The place was empty (that should have been our first clue).

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> being in Greece!\n\n2_fewdgasm\nAugust 15th, 20:30\nI've never been to Greece yet it's on my bucket list! The food is amazing, the people intriguing and the scenery incomparable!\n\nThe closest I've come is visiting local greek restaurants. Years ago ( 1989 to be exact) a new restaurant opened and sent mail coupons to advertise. Taking a chance I ventured out to find the most welcoming, friendly atmosphere with greek food that made me feel as if I had been transported to a greek island! A place where the owner greeted each patron upon entry and gave them a hug or a handshake to say goodbye...what a treat.\n\nSadly, I've only been back a handful of times. No particular reason, just living life and business.... \n\nSaturday, I was thinking of belly dancing , food and good company. My companion and I decided to head out to The Bacchanal restaurant in Phoenix. \nI was hesitant as it had been eight years since I had eaten there.\n\nMy heart leapt and a smile crossed my face as Yoryos, the owner ( a bit grayer yet he had the same spring in his step and welcoming smile on his face) greeted us and seemed genuinely happy we arrived. The live greek band had begun to play and already it was feeling like home.....\n\nWe were seated quickly and promptly ( I recommend reservations on Friday and Saturday nights). The wine list is not extensive but has enough greek wines to interest a connoisseur. The atmosphere was dimly lit with candles, white linen tablecloths. Mirrors added the aura of more space and allowed one to see the dancer from every table.\n\n\nWe started with one of the appetizer variety plates ( Tiropita, spanakopita, dolmades, feta, kalamata olives,\nstuffed mushroom, and tzatziki dip ) The Spanakopita was cheesy, delicate melt in your mouth. The stuffed mushroom ( bacon) was firm not mushy and the bacon was delicate not in your face.\nThe Tiropita was gentle with a buttery crust and delicate cheeses inside. All in all a lovely dish as a good introduction to greek food.\n\nOur entrees arrived. The traditional Moussaka looking lovely in it's red sauce paired with lightly salted potatoes and a mixed vegetable. It was meaty, hearty , tomato flavor that tasted as if your greek mama slaved over it all day. Just enough mix of onion and egg to bring the flavors of the lamb alive. \nThe Veal Bacchanal was served in a creamy white sauce with mushrooms and artichoke hearts! It was tender, juicy and subtle yet very tasty... one bite combined with the artichokes and mushroom made me close my eyes and just say \"" AH'. fewdgasm! \nIm usually not a fan of mixed veggies but the spice and tenderness made them quite tasty.\n\nAs we ate and enjoyed our wines, Alexia , the belly dancer began her moves. She is Yoryos' wife. She was very fluid, beautiful skilled and playful! She moved around all the diners....collecting a few dollars along the way :).\nThe restaurant was full with many birthday groups ( the largest being 25) Yoryos and his wife invited many diners on the dance floor . One beautiful older lady ( 90 if a day) was up doing her own belly dance moves.\nIt was as if one were in a greek home partying until the wee late hours!\nOf course we hit the dance floor a few times !\n\nAs we left Yoryos spoke with us about our evening, my children, his children.... and after I received a kiss , hug and admonition to not wait eight years to come back.....we went home with soul and stomach happy and content.\n\nI give this restaurant 4 of 5 orchids! The service was adequate but not exceptional.\n\nIm ready to go back and next time it will be for MY birthday ! \n\nThe Bacchanal \nBacchanal\n3015 E. Thomas Rd.\nPhoenix, Arizona 85016 \nTelephone: (602) 224-9377\nBelly dancing Friday and Saturday night ( 8-1 ) Live music 8-1 am\nOn Friday and Saturday they have special performances of Folk dancing and traditional Shoe dancing.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  PetSmart is the worst place to take your dog.\n\nTheir petshotel is disgusting..they leave your do in a steel kennel all by themselves and don't care to pay attention to your pup. One time they gave a dog the wrong medicine and had to pay thousands at the vet to get its stomach pumped. Do you really trust your dogs with these employees? They pay them crap wages and it shows in their service. They overcharge for your stay as most other private places will take better care of your dog for much cheaper - really all youre paying for is the name, and having a corporation behind it. Doggie day care is horrible too, dogs have been in there with fleas and they don't care to check them before they toss your dog in their with some random stranger's mangly mutt.\n\nThe dog grooming is even worse. I have heard many screams from upset pooches coming from the salon. Most of the groomers don't care about taking good care of your dog either, they just want to make money. And they will make money off your stupidity with their \""Top Dog Care Package\"" which is $16 for a \""oatmeal/hypoallergenic (*cough* bullshit)\"" shampoo and coniditioner, and a lame attempt at brushing your dogs teeth (do it yourself it's waste of money to get it done here).  Private salons and even vets offer their services at much cheaper prices and we all know that in this tough economy it's very important to save bucks wherever and whenever you can. Even worse than their overpriced grooms, they will call you every 8 WEEKS TO BOTHER YOU to bring your dog in. How annoying! I'll bring my dog in when I want to - harassing me over the phone will not get me to come in.  \n\nTheir products are way overpriced - you can get many similar items at Ryans Pet Supply (14th and McDowell) for much cheaper.  Half the time they're out of something and can't even offer to tell you when they will be getting it, or direct you to something similar. I have seen dogs pee on the endcaps of shelves and employeees just stand around ignoring it.\n\nTheir Banfield vet is a joke. They wanted to charge me $180 to treat my cats ear infection. They are extremely overpriced and it's not personal whatsoever. They don't give a shit about your dog either.\n\nBottom line - go somewhere private. They will treat your dog a hundred times better and with more professional care. <|endoftext|>

I know what you are thinking......how can you mess up grilled cheese? I am still asking myself that question. I gave it another try last night because I did like the decor and the service was good. I thought maybe the cook was having a bad night. I had the Norman Rockwell burger and although it wasn't prepared as rare as I prefer, it was tasty. I was beginning to change my mind about this place until I decided to use the restroom.  Walking into this place, you would never imagine that the bathroom would be filthy. The decor is nice, the service is great, the food is average, and the bathroom is undescribable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The sandwiches were amazing.  My friend and I ordered the soppressata and the tomato, basil, mozzarella to share.  The sandwiches were so fresh.  The ingredients tasted crispy and complimented very well.  I understand the limited menu is so that they can focus on producing less at greater quality but I am so curious to see what else they could put together.  And I kinda wish there was a little more shade outside in the eating area.  It happened to be a hot day amd my cream soda got warm fast and eating a hot sandwich in the sun isn't so easy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Im a fan! \nJosh in parts was very knowledgeable and cool to speak with.\nGood selection of parts and a nice showroom.\nI would give them a 5 star but have not used their service yet on my bike but I will tell you I feel very confident it will be the same great experience! \nGood job guys finally found a bike shop I can trust! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Asked the jewler if he was able to replace the battery in my husband's Tag and he said it wouldn't be a problem.  Left the watch with him while I got a sandwich and when I came back he said he didn't actually have a battery that fit.  Since the watch was in the case and on the pillow, I didn't think to check it right there.  Turns out, he did quite a bit of damage to the back of the watch in his poor attempt at opening the back.  Worse than that is the fact that he didn't mention it at all, leaving me to discover it when it was too late to do anything about it.  I would never bring even the cheapest of jewelry to this place to repair again.  Dishonesty is not a quality you want in someone you're leaving your valuables with. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We first tried this place late last year, it's right down the street from our condo and we were itching to break away from the norm and try a new place.\n\nI am always thinking I might find the next \""it\"" place that no one else has discovered. I know Julio's has been around for awhile but I had never heard anything good/bad about it.\n\nIt probably didn't help the start to our dining expierience that an ex-manager/co-worker came into the dining area when were first sat down. Let's just say I pretty much disagreed with this person on every aspect of life and leave it at that. \n\nService was slow, very slow. It was a lazy Sunday and place was not even half full. They finally brought the meal and it was wrong, we waited another 20-25 min and I think part of it was wrong again. I don't even remember what we got it was so forgettable. Just blah, it provided some calories and nothing more. Everything was just bland an so-so. \n\nI gave them 2 stars instead of one because they did comp our entire bill. I felt somewhat bad for the waiter so I left him a big tip and got out of there, so much for trying a new place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter! <|endoftext|>

Knowing they are there to help me figure out any problems I may have with my computer for FREE is one of my favorite things about being an Apple user. \n\nSeriously, who needs a manual?\n\nI mostly use this store for tech support. Fortunately, I don't have to go too often. It's so easy. You can make an appointment with the genius bar via computer at home. Waltz in 1 minute before your appointment time and get all the help you need from some brainy computer geek a minute later. \n\nThe store as a retail option is confusing. Who do you talk to for what and when? Though, it's cool that whoever's helping you can ring you up right there in the middle of the sales floor. At least you don't have to go wait in a register line after you've cracked the code! :) <|endoftext|>

You don't realize how awful the food really is until about 30 minutes after you have eaten it.  5 of us eat there tonight, we each had different items, pasta, fish and chips, potato skins, combination of vegetable sides, a sandwich, and other items.   Everything was GREAZY and salty.  But you don't realize how much grease until 15-30 minutes after eating when your skin gets oily, you feel sludgy, thirsty, and loose your energy.  I don't know what grease or ingredients they use, but it's terrible.  We all went home after and didn't feel like doing anything after this.\nI've been there before for beer on the deck, the beer is good, but don't eat the food.  \nContrary to many of the other reviews, the service was very good.

The spicy pickles are from a can, also their vegetable curry is made with frozen vegetables not fresh ... Also I know its not a authentic place when the serve beef...  No authentic place will ever serve beef, they will serve goat, lamb, chicken and every animal except beef... what else, oh yea two of the servers started chewing each other out in the back of the room where EVERYONE could here.... Also they should invest in making \""chaat\"" food - street food of india .. they had none of that one the menu!  I will give it 1 star because the garlic naan was good.. Also our waiter was really nice it was some guy who moved here from SD... Save your indian food craving and head down to Chicago <|endoftext|>

My lasagna tasted OK but the whole thing was crispy on the outside like it had been made earlier and once ordered, was put under a broiler. My wife's steak was very bland, tender, but not flavorful at all. The waiter asked how her steak was and she replied, \""it's OK.\"" He said, \""OK? Just OK?\"" Trying to drag it out of her, so she told him that it was bland. He apologized and asked if she wanted him to take it back. She said no, we got our check, and left. My lasagna was a $7 meal at best. My wife said her's was priced decently but had no flavor. <|endoftext|>

They are always pouring something tasty by the glass so you don't have to be ready to commit to a bottle.  Sometimes it can get pretty crowded on the patio especially at the end of the week in summer, but come in for a post-work gossip in the middle of the week and you're likely to have the place almost to yourself. Plus, of course, you can load up on great wine by the bottle, but it's more fun to come there frequently and take the wine home one glass at a time. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My buddy wrote to me and said I should do a review of Mark Pi's China Gate. To be completely honest, I thought I had. I checked and saw that indeed, I had not. It's been a good six months since my last visit, I remember what I ordered and how good the entire experience was.\n\nI ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and an order of bok choy which was steamed first, then quickly stir fried, delicious. The eggplant was tender, a touch of heat from chilis, garlicky, meaty and filling, served with brown rice, very nutritious. My family all ordered something different, Judy, my cousin who thinks China Gate is the finest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and would come here at the drop of a hat, ordered her Chicken and Green Beans. I must admit, when I did eat meat, I've had this on many occasions and it's really very good. The green beans are crisp tender, the chicken is finely ground,  moist, and tender.\n\nOver all Mark Pi's China Gate is good Chinese food, served in a nice atmosphere, and a great value for your hard earned buck. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. This is one of the better Chinese places in Madison, although it can be a little spendy (not too bad, though) compared to your run-of-the-mill Chinese take-out joint. It's worth it, though.\n\nThe menu here is huge, and the portions match. I've never come here and not had leftovers to reheat the next day. \n\nThe food itself is almost always excellent. The wonton soup and anything with duck in it, in particular, are really well-flavored. \n\nThis is also one of the few Chinese restaurants I've been to that does an equally good job of catering the adventurous eaters and people who are a little bit less comfortable with something out of the ordinary. \n\nService is also always friendly and quick, especially considering how big the restaurant is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We went to the Mcninch House last Wednesday for yet another work dinner (no complaints here)!! There was 5 of us in our party and we had this beautiful Old Victorian House to ourselves!! We were the only reservation they had that evening the server insisted they were fully booked the rest of the week though!\n\nIf you have never been or never heard of them before, they ask for you and your party to call in how many courses and what entree choice you would like the day before so that they can plan a menu specifically for your party. We opted for the \""Premiere\"" which was the 5 courses for $79 each.\n\nThe house was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree in each room each with a different theme. Very warm and of course a lot of history! \n\nI chose the Braised Coq au Vin  wrapped in Prosciutto served with couscous and a mushroom reduction...it was dry edible but dry. I only got that so that everyone was eating something different! I should have chosen the Osso Bucco!! Everyone else loved their entrees!!  I really enjoyed everything that they served before it. I just was not blown away by any of it.\n\nI feel that the ambiance was what really won me over and if I were ever to go back it would again be on my Boss' dime!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Being Vietnamese I've had tried tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants and Tram's has to be one of the worse place I've ever been to. The food was mediocre and full of MSG. I ordered a rice vermicelli dish with egg rolls and they were oily and greasy. The Pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty. \n\nMy total bill doesn't reflect the price of the dishes I ordered. My bill came out to be higher than what's listed on the menu. Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time, they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night. \n\nAlthough the old man at the place is nice, this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well, it's probably all been said and been done about this place. Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\n\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\n\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \n\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\n\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \n\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \n\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \n\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \n\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\n\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \n\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure. But like I care! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Alexander's Steakhouse is by far the most interesting eating you can get by the mall area. In the middle of the restaurant is a large charcoal grill surrounded by seasonings and buckets of what claims to be butter. Basically your pick out a steak and cook it yourself alongside potatoes and good old texas toast, dousing on the butter as you go. No, this is not health food. They have a variety of different steak cuts, as well as some chicken and pork selections. It's a rowdy crowd and expect lots of drinking around the grill and I had my doubts about sanitation with all the drunken butter use. If you want a backyard grill experiences in the dead of winter, this place is great, but it's very pricey, loud, and I found out the hard way about charges for sharing ($7!). <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mother's Dy Brunch- 3 adults and 1 child - 180.00 - only drinks were 2 waters and 2 teas-  gratuity was included in bill - so service was barely passable.  Food was okay - but not worth the price charged.  However - the crepes were awesome - the saving grace.  The entertainment was good and the atmosphere fine.  Probably would NOT go back.  Don't see a good value.  Do not recommend. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  *pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba.\nIt's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.  \nThe food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.  \nThe fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies.\nThe service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.  \n*pffffffffffffft* <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been searching for a decent take out Chinese place for awhile, and there are a few in this area. This hap pend to be the first one I tried, and maybe ordering the traditional take out dishes was the downfall, but I was disappointed. \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered beef with snow peas and water chestnuts, and a spicy vegetable kung pao type thing with fried rice. The flavor, quality, and freshness of the ingredients was very bland and seemed to be more of a public cafeteria type quality. The menu had a number of specialty dishes, so maybe we ordered the wrong items, but I don't think I'll be going back to find out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I would highly recommend Foundation for the Carolinas for an uptown wedding in Charlotte, NC.  My husband and I got married there in August 2014. \n\nWe were able to comfortably use this space for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception for 107 guests.  The 4th floor space we used was newly renovated, and with good weather you can utilize the patio spaces, which have awesome views of the city, including the changing color Duke Energy building.  \n\nWe are starting to get back our professional photos and the venue photographed beautifully; it was the perfect backdrop, in fact we chose to do our sneak peak in the 1st floor gallery space.  \n\nWe really enjoyed working with the staff, Rebecca and David, and loved this venue's uptown location.  It is a block and a half from Holiday Inn Center City and across the street from The Dunhill.  It was very accessible for our out-of-town guests to stay uptown and walk to all of the weekend wedding celebrations.\n\nhttp://evergreenstudio1.com/blog/?p=3960 <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Okay, so I was completely prepared for the worst when I got here, since the average review for this place was about 2 stars.\n\nMy flight landed in the morning, and I called to see if checking in early would be an option. It wasn't. I should have a shot around 1:30pm, though.  Okay, cool..I'll find something to do for 4 hours. So I drop in at 2:30pm--surely they have ONE clean non-smoking room ready, right??\n \nNo....they don't. I'm a little annoyed at this point, but the girl behind the desk can't really do anything about it, so I walk back to my car and sleep for an hour....then finally, success. There's a $20(?) deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week. We'll see. If you've read my other reviews, I NEVER have great luck with these \""deposits.\""\n\nAbout the room:\n-It's not new. But it's not old, either. \n-There's a tube tv circa 1999, no fridge OR microwave OR coffee machine. Those things you'll have to specifically request (for a fee!). \n-The walls? Terribly, terribly thin. I'm nervous about going to sleep tonight....and waking up in the morning.\n-Couple of hairs floating around the room. The bed, the lamp shade...and the shower wall was COVERED in them. Speaking of the bathroom...\n-Not cleaned. At all. Somebody's draws were on the door (I took a pic). The aforementioned hairs all over the shower wall. And there's no way in the world they could've cleaned that bathtub....it definitely hasn't seen any kind of cleaner in a while. The draws on the door were enough for me; I showered with a towel on the tub floor cuz I just didnt want to touch anything in there.\n\nYou'd think as long as they took to get me a room here, the room would be sparkling! Now I'm starting to think all they did was make the bed, fold some towels, and move on.\n\nI really wanna just leave here and sleep somewhere else, but I already paid for the room. I'm mad at myself for going through Priceline...the cheaper rate I got is not worth the hassle this place has been. \n\nDon't do it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The security guard who works at the front desk is rude, unfriendly and offensive as can be.  He seems to think he owns the place and bosses people around. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like Java Detours drinks. Especially the Oreo Latte, yum!Employees are always very friendly. The one thing that disappointed me is that they had a punch card for customers (buy 10 drinks get one free) and I devotedly brought it with me everytime I went there to get it punched. I was one punch away from a free drink when I handed my punch card over to the employee and she said sorry they discontinued them. I was very disappointed. I understand if they discontinued the punch card concept, but at least honor the ones that are still in circulation! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was really surprised at how much good stuff they had at Christmas. I was looking for gigantic bows and I found them there and more! The gal that stocks the place really takes pride to make sure everything is where it should be and knows it like the back of her hand. You ask, she knew exactly where it \""would' be if they still had it. I will go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I cannot say enough good things about Walter's.  Tim, the head mechanic (Tim Walter, hence the name of the shop), is amazingly helpful and accommodating.  He repairs my car quickly every time I go in, and I never have to bring it back for further repairs.  He also fits me in right away (though it is a good idea to call ahead - they do get super busy because of their sheer awesomeness and small size).  And when I pick my car up, he'll explain what was wrong and how he fixed it in a completely unpatronizing way, then usually undercharge me.  I know, sounds too good to be true, but isn't.  I'll be moving for grad school soon, and I can honestly say I will miss Walter's.  I don't think I'll ever find a better shop/mechanic.  \nA quick word of warning: Tim's adorable, but completely ADD.  He'll fix your car well, and quickly, but he does get easily distracted sometimes.  Bear with it, he's totally worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded, so we sat at the bar, even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. We were just 4, but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. It was also very loud for a weekday, the noise from other tables carrying easily.\n\nI ordered the french dip sandwich, with risotto on the side. To their credit, the risotto was delicious, but such a tiny portion, I inhaled it in no time. Especially considering the french dip was so boring. The meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. Not to mention, the food is definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, but if I did, I'd order the risotto and nothing else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm amazed that I just learned about this place. If I was smarter about it, I would take the cash discount and go so far as compare prices with ABC stores. I'll just believe all the other reviews about pricing since it's just a fun place to shop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had to call the police to get a refund for my food we waited 15 minutes the food did not come.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I find the Pittsburgh Saks to be friendlier than Saks in many other cities.\n\nIt's always a joy to talk to the people working at the perfume counter. They are very willing to let you sniff different kinds of perfumes; they patiently wait for you to make a decision; and they are perfectly pleasant even if your final decision is to not buy anything; they will still give you free samples if they have some.\n\nThe sales clerk in the dresses section is also helpful. I once had to buy a dress in a hurry, and the person assisting me picked out three candidates (all on sale) and offered me her honest opinion about which one looked good on me. No attitude at all.\n\nOverall, I find shopping at Saks a better experience than shopping at the Macy's nearby. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came in to the store and no one greeted me even though there were 5 employees on at 8 am. Ordered a venti iced coffee with 2 pumps white mocha instead of the regular pumps of classic and they charged me for a full set of pumps (.60) when I asked why I was being charged, very coldly and dignified, the barista told me it is corporate policy... I responded with I know corporate, I was a partner for 6 years. Personally, I would never have charged for the white mocha seeing that I was not getting the full pumps and I was not getting the classic syrup. Never coming to this one again. I much prefer the stores closer to my house. At my store we made sure to greet every guest when they came in and tried to make a connection with everyone who ordered a drink. If this is the same regional manager as other Starbucks I've been to then they need to know he is not doing a good job. A lot of stores are not gold standard. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came here for lunch this week on a business lunch with two other people. I had never heard of Alexander Michael's until a client recommended it. It is situated in a house just a couple blocks from the heart of Uptown. The environment inside is very pleasant and homey. It has a true neighborhood pub feel. The service was excellent, even during the busy lunch rush. \n\nI got the london broil sandwich and it was tasty. My coworker highly enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich. My client got the chicken pita which he really liked a lot. He opted for the pasta salad as a side and said it was great.\n\nI want to come back sometime to try out the dinner options! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Man, I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed, hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place, but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing about the beef, chicken, or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens, but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees, each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of \""snow peas, carrots, and a sampling of shrimp.\""  And to make matters worse, despite the diversity of dishes available, there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty. \n\nHot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off, and it's neither hot nor sour, really.  \n\nWhen my sister visited and tried this place, she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.\n\nFor me, the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!  Supremely unpleasant and tossed it out immediately.  You want to believe it was an accident the first time, but when it happens twice in a row... it's no accident.  Something's busted with the people, product, or process.\n\ndmo out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a terrible experience, didn't have anything stolen or broken, but the car wasn't super clean. I payed for the VIP wash which includes cup holders and dash and the cup holder obviously hadn't even been opened, there was still lint on the back seat, and anything that wasn't in plain view like the dash and steering wheel wasn't really even touched. Probably won't be returning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my default hotel when I'm staying in Pittsburgh.  The rooms were remodeled a few years ago, which was really needed.  This is a quiet hotel right in the heart of the business district.  Rooms are mixed - some are very small and have interior veiws, others are huge and have views of the river.  There is a very nice gym in the basement - cardio and strength equipment (if that isn't good enough, you can get a free pass to Golds a few blocks away).\n\nOne caution - this place does tend to fill up / usually the first hotel downtown to sell out. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For those that like an abundance of mediocre food that is poorly cooked than this is the place to be. For those that actually like good food I would suggest another restaurant and preferably not a chain.  \n\nThe only saving grace was the frozen yogurt and the fried shrimp. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Checked this place out after it showed up on Groupon and took a few classes. Decided that hot yoga wasn't for me but it wasn't a bad experience.\n\nThere were only a few things that didn't sit well with me: (1) carpet is used in the studio (that can't be really sanitary) and (2) classes are packed wall to wall. With the amount of members coming in, seems like they should have an appointment block for each class to limit the amount of people in the studio and make for a more pleasant class experience. \n\nIt wasn't for me but then again, I'd likely not try a hot yoga class again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The experience here was wonderful. It was a quiet and personal venue that helped me get a delicious burger and let my girlfriend enjoy a light/fresh salad. Guys- excellent dinner spot! Ladies- great flavorful food, and light on the portions. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love that I've found a bookstore that isn't a chain. As much as Borders and Barnes are tried and true, it's refreshing to know that an indy is still around. They've got racks of books outside that will charm you and entice you to come inside, and once you do you'll be sure to find a great selection and gifty items on top of it. Brides, they give away a complimentary bridal book with lots of great resources - it's pretty thick! ;) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We live about 200 miles from Phoenix and do not have a Fertility Center in our area. My wife and I went to Dr. Gounala after a very bad experience with another fertility center in Phoenix. She and her staff seemed very caring and nice, she recommended that we have IVF with ICSI to improve our chances of conceiving. We were prepared to do this and everything seemed to be on course until they found that my Health Insurance would pay for some of the tests (Semen Analysis, Blood Work etc..) related to infertility. Then things changed. Dr. Gounala said that there were many \""PROBLEMS\"" we had to make trips to Phoenix about once or twice a week for a Semen Analysis or Blood Work? this went on for almost a 2 year period!! Before we were just about ready to give up we were refferred to a doctor in Tucson (which is about 300 miles from where we live) We scheduled an appointment and from the time we met with him until we were pregnant was a total of 4 MONTHS. He did not do a single semen analysis and very few tests on my wife. we now have a beautiful 2 month old baby girl... And did I mention the price was 50% of what SW fertility was going to charge us?? I would be very cautious of these fertility centers they are fully aware how despirate couples can be and how limited their options are....I have experienced it so I know they will use this to their advantage to bleed you dry!! IVF is enough of an emotional rollercoaster to go through with out having to worry about an unethical practice stringing you along to make some additional money.... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was in town on business and was told that if I was going to eat Italian, it had to be from this place.  As I got off work one night I decided to place an order for pick-up.  (Glad I did!  The place was packed and the wait was long!)  \nI ordered the Pesto Penne Bake, sounded good enough. I received my order and the first thing I could smell though the closed bag was the garlic! (thought maybe it was just the garlic bread-ha boy was I wrong!!!)  When I got back to the hotel I opened it up and the smell of garlic was even more overwhelming!  The pasta bowl looked good enough though.\nThis dish has so much garlic in it that it is not edible to the average person!  (I had to open the patio door to the room just to air out the garlic smell!)  \nIf you can get past the overpowering smell and taste of the garlic then it was a good dish.  But I must say the garlic is what ruined it for me.  Don't think I would go there again if I was in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The first time I stepped into the store, I was hit by a wave of wonderful aromas that reminded me of growing up in Germany. The lunch meats, smoked hams, brats, blutwurst, etc are from authentic German recipes, and one can even get a real schnitzel here. The ladies behind the counter treat you like you would get treated in a store in Germany, and the store also offers a selection of foods imported from Germany. Jams, coffee, breads, dairy products like butter and quark, cookies, candy, canned goods, cooking and baking mixes.... \nIf you have German recipes and haven't made them because you can't find the right ingredients, or if you just like good food, please pay this store a visit. You will be pleasantly surprised. But bring cash! No credit cards accepted. Or you could go next door to the Black Forest Mill to have your German meal prepared for you along with a German beer.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Read a review from the newspaper so I tried it. Not impressed. The atmosphere is about as dismal as the food. They need to make it a place people want to come in and eat instead of get out of there as soon as possible. Gross! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They were the best to buy from a year ago (Terra Trike Rambler),and when I called back a few days ago to ask about my brakes they said to bring it right in and they would  repair it for free.  Worked with Joe today and he and the crew are the friendliest  and most helpful people. It does not get any better then this people. Shop here ,buy here and never have a regret. We came in from Surprise and they respect the fact that is a far piece away and appreciate that we pass a lot of good bike shops to get to them. They value your business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just picked up my custom ring from Jewels & Estate Gallery and I am thrilled.  I brought in an 8x10 printout of a dragon that I wanted made into a ring.  Bonnie designed the layout, keeping me up to date with the progress via a photo then a wax impression.  The dragon on the finished ring measures just over 1/2\"".  What artistry to shrink that 8x10 to a perfectly detailed 1/2\""!  And from start to finish it took under 3 weeks.  This is not my first purchase from Jewels & Estate Gallery and it certainly won't be my last.  Thanks Bonnie & Darrell. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Shut your mouth!  Meatloaf of the Gods!  There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf.  It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies.  All of this for $10.  Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10.  \n\nThe broccoli was blanched rather than steam.  So it was not mushy.  \n\nThe service is incredible.  The people are friendly and the food comes up fast.  I have nothing but good things to say.  On a date?  With family?  Have a small child?  Check this place out.  \n\nThey get desserts from a local bakery.  The carrot cake is ridiculous.  Are you full from your meal?  Take cake or pie to go.  Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Dave and I were exploring to new places around our new home and came across this lovely cafe in the middle of the Arizona Center. We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  \n\nWe started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. \nFor dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. \n\nOver all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There are some upsides to this place, such as decent lunch and happy hour specials and friendly wait staff, that make this an acceptable destination for a quick working lunch or a 6 Sapporo / sake, edemame and California Roll dinner. Anything more than that is sure to dissapoint anyone and everyone with an even remotely refined taste for Japanese cuisine. The sushi, sashimi and specialty rolls are generic and uninspired. The attention to detail, care in preparation and harmony of flavors - that generally make Japanese cuisine so special - is altogether absent. And the freshness, or lack thereof, is downright concerning. All of this is especially disappointing because this is such a good location and space for a quality Japanese place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not much beats this place in North Phoenix. Plenty of good beer, good pub food and good company. Great place on a Friday night for live music. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love this restaurant.  For the past 11 years we have gone there or picked up dinner almost every Friday.  It is great to invite friends for dinner and pick up the dinner at the Sushi Box.  The food always looks beautiful and is well liked (for those who do not like raw fish, there are lovely cooked things).  Mr and Mrs Kim are always incredibly accommodating to our varied needs. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is just for the service at the US Airways ticket counter. I had to share.\nMy grandmother, bless her heart, wanted to buy my ticket with her flyer miles. On Friday night we arrived at the ticket counter and they appeared to be closed. Though I believe that we went to the wrong counter. We vowed to come back at six the next morning and by golly I was up at 5:22 a.m.\n\nI'm not a happy morning person so I'm quite asleep. My grandmother is awake and on a mission. We pay $4 for parking and walk up to the ticket counter, no line, no waiting. Things are looking pretty good.\n\nMy grandmother says she wants to buy a ticket for me using her flyer miles. The ticket lady looks at us and asks us if we had made a reservation.\n\""What, we have to make a reservation to come to the airport and buy a ticket?\""\nMy grandmother is irritated with the lady and it hasn't even been 2 minutes. She doesn't let this show, but I can feel it.\n\nI tell her I need a ticket from Phoenix to Dublin and I tell her Sept. 15.\n\""Booked,\"" she replies.\n\""Well, try the sixteenth.\""\n\""Booked.\""\n\""The fourteenth?\""\n\""Booked.\""\n\""Try everything from the thirteenth to the twenty-first.\""\n\""Booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked.\""\n\""Really? This is more than a month in advance? A friend of mine just bought a plane ticket to France three weeks prior to her departure date. Try another airline, maybe Aer Lingus. I found round trip tickets from $768 and one-ways for $459.\""\n\""That's a really good deal you should probably go with that if you can get it.\""\n\""Well, how much is a one-way ticket for Aer Lingus on the 15th of Sept.?\""\n\""$2,000.\""\n\nI was afraid that my grandmother was going to have a heart attack. She gasped and stood there with her mouth open. We walked upstairs and sat at a table to call the flight fund people that were supposed to make a reservation for us and magically bestow the flyer miles.\nAfter giving the guy on the phone her life story for computer input on his end he asks, \""So where is your grand-daughter going?\""\n\""From Phoenix to Dublin.\""\n\""Ma'am I'm sorry this is US only. I'll have to transfer you to our international department.\""\n\nI sit and stare at the people walking through the airport at this ungodly hour (for me anyway.)\nNow she is talking to a woman in the international sector for the miles.\nThe woman asks what my return date is and my grandmother tells her that the ticket is one-way. I am going for school for a year and have no idea when I will be back.\nThe woman kindly informs us that unless I am a citizen of the UK I can not get a one-way ticket to Ireland by using flyer miles. But I can get a round trip ticket and then just change the date for a fee of $275! And also to do that my grandmother is 20,000 miles short, she only has 30,000 miles which would have been enough for the one-way ticket.\n\nMy grandmother asks how much would it be to just buy the 20,000 miles and the woman on the other end tells her that it would probably cost as much, if not more, than buying a regular ticket.\n\""Well how much is a regular round trip ticket?\""\nMy grandmother turns white as a ghost. She is breathless as her mouth hangs wide open. I am afraid her heart actually did stop.\nShe looks at me as she writes the figure on the paper in front of her.\n$4,798.\n\nI tell her to hang up. We are going home and I'm going on the internet.\nI bought a one-way ticket from Phoenix to Dublin leaving on Sept. 15th for $530.\nFunnier yet, I actually got the ticket for the two airlines the ticket lady said was either booked or expensive... US Airways and Aer Lingus.\nThank you Priceline.com. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This store discriminates against customers who may have problems carrying items since you are not allowed to take a cart out.  Why is that?  Target next door lets you take your cart to your car, are they discriminating against the Ross clientele (I've seen a review calling this store \""ghetto.\"" I see no difference in Target and Fry's customer base and Ross'.  I did go there because a friend had gotten a good deal on a furniture accessory but then realized I couldn't carry it to my car because of back issues.   I did mention this to security..he said I could drive up (that's a very busy area),I also mentioned it to the cashier and when a very nice man heard me he offered to carry it out to the car.  Also the wait was long because they shut down one register so the cashier could stack up hangars!  so hangars are more important than a line of customers. most of the store was dirty, disorganized, lacking price tags, etc.  never again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Despite being a Marriott-brand hotel, Courtyard Pittsburgh Downtown's service and room qualities were not up to par with the Marriott standard but still charged Marriott price.\n\nI had a bad impression of this hotel before I even entered. I made a two-night reservation for a business trip, but I was stranded in an airport overnight because of cancelled flights. I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying. Eventually, I had to get my project manager to resolve this issue. \n\nBoth the room and the lobby were not spacious, although that's understandable given that the hotel was in downtown. What's not understandable was the creaking floor throughout the hotel floor, which amplified no matter how light my steps were. Good thing that I was not living below night owls, but that would not matter because the AC unit was too loud to get a good sleep anyway. Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me.\n\nSeriously reconsider if you decide to live here. Aside from sub-par room and service that are unusually low by the Marriott standard, note that the only available parking nearby will escalate the unjust price that you have to pay to stay in this hotel. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is, by far, one of my favorite places in the Strip District! My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great cupcakes and cookies.  Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world.  It's a shame.  Twice now,  they have goofed up my cupcake order.  No apologies for the mistakes both times.  On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order.  I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did.  No problem.  However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price.  When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me.  Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund.   So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Never again.\n\nLines are terribly long, mostly due to slow, incompetent counter employees working with no sense of urgency.  Requested car seats but got to the car and no car seats were to be found.  Took over 30 minutes of screaming and threatening employees to finally get someone to bring them out.  Car seats were dirty and old.  Employee had tried to clean them but essentially just got them all wet, forcing our kids to sit on towels in the car seats.  Belts were all mangled requiring both seats to be fully taken apart and put back together.  And know this -- Hertz provides no assistance with car seats -- something that should have been made clear at the time of the reservation.  All in all, it took well over an hour to get out of the parking lot, which happens to be designed so that no traffic can easily get in or out, especially at busy times.  And to think Hertz actually charges MORE than most of their competitors.\n\nHertz was once a great company.  But every interaction I've had with them in the last 5 years has steadily shown them going downhill.  Well, guess what Hertz?  You finally hit bottom. I will never ever do business with you again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been there twice to have dress clothes tailored. The first was for a full suit and a pair of pants. The owner said to return the following Saturday, which I did, and he did not have them ready. Not only that, but he acted like it was my fault I showed back up on time. \n\nSecond time same deal, two pairs of pants, not done on time and when they were done they were not tailored correctly. I'll be going out of my way to a different tailor from now on. \n\nIn addition, the prices are on the very high side without the service or results. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place will make u upset every time u come because the wait times are excruciatingly long and nobody here gives a crap about it. The front desk is defensive and rude from the start. I have come here multiple times and waited upwards of two hours. Not exaggerating, and not a soul in that office ever apologized. Drs to be fair are good but u will end up bald from pulling your hair out from frustration if u go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My weakness, what is it? It's summed up in the name of this place, Borders Books Music and Cafe. Books are my weakness. Nothing is so erotic as the smell of a new book. Oh, wait. Music is my weakness. All kinds, even. And coffee? Well, I want some of that, too. \n\nThis Borders is an okay place. I ain't complaining. I even came her the week before Christmas to do some shopping (spur of the moment decision). The lines were long. The aisles, crowded. But, I had a new book to read. I had gifts. I was set for the holidays. \n\nIn the middle of January (on the 20th, to be exact), my car veered into the parking lot, opened its door and shoved me out, saying, \""Go buy a new book, damnit.\"" Who was I to protest? So, I did. I walked in gingerly, unsure if I should get another new book - at the rate I was reading, I would need a new one every week. Who really has an extra $68 lying around? Isn't that what libraries are for? Anyway, I succumbed and bought a book. Then I drove away, satisfied. \n\nYou see, Borders emails me coupons. And today, I updated my online profile so I can receive coupons from other companies, like Target and Priceline. Nothing like supporting the large conglomerates, right? Well, I like to think it's a small token of their appreciation, when, in fact, I know it's just a tease - save 10% on a purchase of 50$! Like, oh my god, that's totally worth it. (insert eye roll)  \n\nBut, I can't complain. It's books, music and coffee - under one roof. Not to mention magazines, including Under the Radar and literary 'rags! And odds and ends that make perfect gifts, including what I picked up for my grandmother's retirement and my best bud's birthday. \n\nAs for my car, it wants to go to Borders again. I can just feel it. Maybe I'll be real nice and take it there today... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is awesome! I love it. The wait staff is very casual about everything (don't go if you are in a rush). The hot tea that they serve you is my favorite! The \""meat\"" and \""seafood\"" dishes could really make you worry that you are eating meat. The stuffed tomatoes are delicious as well as the sweet and sour pork, I also really liked the lemon grass fish. I took a friend who was a Janeist (VERY strict diet!), and he wouldn't believe that it wasn't meat, lol. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everytime I travel to Charlotte and stay at the Marriott City Center I visit Champions. Consistency builds trust. Trust is how a business thrives.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate coming here, the receptionist seems mad always, she has a rude tone and makes you feel like you are annoying her.

I can tell he got irritated when he knew I had to be refered out..... read riviews in the end we make him business and his staff gets paid because we the patients bring business.... hmmm maybe they should think about this <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Authentic Mexican food in an authentic Mexican barrio.  Yes, it's 'dirty' (although it has yet to fail a health inspection), and yes, it's not in a gentrified neighborhood where every building looks the same,  but it is some of the best 'home-cooked' Mexican you'll get this side of the border.  Personal favorites include the machaca, chorizo, and of course the tortillas.\n\nSo if you want great street style Mexican food, this is the place for you,  but if you're uptight drone  who value style over substance stick to the tex-mex joints in your generic suburban strip malls.\n\nRemember to pick up a dozen or so of  their home made tortillas you take with you.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are amongst the best tortillas in the world! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is great for a chill dinner and drinks. A very laid back atmosphere makes it perfect for dinner before heading out or just relaxing all night. It has a bar atmosphere without the crazy drunks and extremely loud crowd. The food isn't 5 star, but you can never go wrong with Fried Pickles and the What It Is. YUM! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yuck!  I was on my way to Johnny Burritos when I saw their sign of \""specials\"".  I stopped in and ordered the cream of potato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  Both were awful.  The soup had the consistency of milk, and not much flavor.  It's no where close to \""cream of\"" anything.   The cheese on the sandwich was so thin that I pried it open just to ensure myself that they hadn't only given me 2 pieces of plain bread.  I like to support small mom and pop businesses, so I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but it was so off-putting that I don't plan to ever return.  Next time, I'll keep walking to Johnny Burritos. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place came HIGHLY recommended by a friend of mine, and so when my car's brakes went all squishy, I took it in.   First, the good:  This place is sooo clean, the guys are all awesome, polite, knowledgeable and you just get a great sense of being in a respectable place.   \n\nThe bad: One the way out the door, the mechanic that checked me in mentioned that it would be \""Fifty bucks to check out the car, and we'll call you with a quote.\""\n\nThe quote came in for almost $900, which was far more than I was able to pay.   When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. \n\nI was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.\n\nBottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.\n\nUPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.   I am reducing my stars down from two stars to one, because they were OBVIOUSLY out to rip me off, not just charge me a premium for premium service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As someone who knows Phoenix bookstores said to me, \""they have great books.' That's the bottom line -- obviously excellent collections of rare antiquarian books find their way here. \n\nMy only complaint is that the balance between the \""secured area\"" of rare books in cases, and general used books on shelves, is tilted too far against access and towards security. It makes browsing a lot of work.\n\nPrices are very fair for the kinds of books they have. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We have tried Havana Cafe several times as we love Cuban food (used to live in Miami). Tonight, once again we had just OK food and way over paid. \n\nMy Daughter has to eat \""gluten free\"" and we found out today they do NOT have a dedicated fryer.  At the table next to us the kids were eating chicken nuggets.  My Celiac peers please double check before eating here.\n\nThe Masas de Puerco was dry and I ended up with the burned part of the beans from the bottom of the pan.  The food is barely average and super expensive.  We had 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes for four of us (2 kids) with one soda and it was over $60.  Kids dishes are $9.95. <|endoftext|>

I've since moved away from Pittsburgh but recently was sent some Penn Mac merchandise and it was a dream!  They package everything so well and ship it quickly!

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Don't use this company. They don't put due dates on their bills and then get shitty with you when you don't pay your bill on time. How am I suppose to know what is ON TIME, if there is no due date. Also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile. A lot of chemicals in one pile results in DEAD grass. The technician with an 8th grade iq level didn't even bother to tell anyone. When we noticed it, we were offered a very small compensation for their incompetent workers. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to Ingleside on a friend's recommendation after not being able to get good care or a thorough exam at another Arcadia area vet.\n\nWhile the end result of my visit was making the excruciatingly difficult decision to humanely euthanize my cat, I could not be more pleased with the care he received there as well as their compassion towards both of us.\n\nDr. Ronaldo(or Rolando-I can't remember which) was beyond amazing. She was able to quickly diagnose my cat, ran him through x rays with no problem(when the other vet I went to wanted to sedate him for x rays which likely would have complicated his illness and maybe even resulted in death) and was completely compassionate and patient with me. I ended up spending half a day at the office on a holiday and was the last person to leave. I think they left the office open just for me judging by the lack of cars in the parking lot and no patients in the lobby.\n\nCould not recommend this vet more. They made a horrible process as \""easy\"" as possible. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a great neighborhood (though we really don't live that close) flower shop. My sister started going here years & years ago. Then I think my mom started going. Probably my other sister. Then I became a fan.\n\nJeff is always there. He has a great eye. He also puts up with my last minute request without issue. I know I can trust him to come up with great arrangements time & time again.\n\nMy favorite thing though is to go in there & see what he has in, look at some of the vases & suggest a thing or two. Then I let him do the magic and get out of his way. That way I end up with something a bit personal but done in great style.\n\nThe arrangements are always a great value as well. I will admit that I've even looked on-line recently (proflowers.com) but once they tack on all their add-on fees, handling fees, shipping, etc., there's really no reason at all not to go local.\n\nArcadia Flowers is definitely my go to flower shop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Huge disappointment! What a waste of money! \nFirst of all, the waitress seemed personally insulted that our group of four just ordered waters and gave up even pretending to be friendly at that point.\nSecond of all, the food was absolutely not worth the money. We ordered their signature hot dog, the hamburger sliders and cheese fries. The hot dog bun was dry, the sliders tasted exactly like McDonalds' hamburgers (which are okay but not for that price) and the cheese fries were the worst any of us had ever eaten. Imagine getting the cheapest cheese (most likely it wasn't even real cheese but just the stuff out of a spray can) you can find and putting it on fries and that's what you get. It was disgusting.\nNeedless to say, we will never return! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I recently had lunch with a colleague at Ratcliffe on the Green. It a business lunch and I usually don't note things like the building and decor, but in this case it was unavoidable. The decor and service were impeccable. The service had that nice balance of friendliness and professionalism. They were always available and addressed out needs, but I never saw them hovering about. My colleague is a regular there, so we were greeted warmly and our greeter (who happened to also be an active local judge???) shared with us some stories from his recent trip to Paris. My meal started with a cream of tomato soup, that was much thicker than I had anticipated, but still very tasty. Lunch was a Carolina Crab Cake Salad which was fabulous. Nice view of downtown Charlotte outside our window table from which we were able to watch a rain storm pass, thankfully, before heading back to work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This has to be one of the worst airports ever!  If you get dropped off (or picked up), you get yelled at for taking too long. Then they have double \""parking\"" on drop off so you get yelled out for not being able to move. Huh?  Once inside you're kind of on your own...not a lot of signs to direct you to the right place. If you ask for help, you will more than likely be \""greeted\"" with an unfriendly \""yeah\"".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have free wifi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Originally had planned to eat at Deejai, but we were hungry and didn't feel like waiting. I had heard about Cuisine Malaya but always was hesitant to try it. For some reason my expectations were pretty low (location maybe?) but I figured since the reviews weren't bad, I would give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nService was good and prompt. I ordered the curry duck. It was delicious. The vegetables that the duck came in were nice and fresh tasting and not soggy, despite the fact that the curry came in a bit of a soupy broth. My date had one of the noodle dishes with tofu and really enjoyed her meal as well. Her portion was also quite large, and ended up becoming lunch for the next day (bonus). All in all, a good experience and I am looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Honestly this is the best Italian food I've ever had. The only bummer is that it's ruined Italian food for anywhere else I go.

The ham breakfast burrito I had was very filling.  My wife had the Chorizo breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint.  Most importantly we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.\n\nMy second time here was the same.  I decided to try the Wednesday special, Arroz con Pollo and my wife had the chicken chimi.  We again were satisfied.  I hate to compare Chico's to a Filiberto's but it is similar in style but provides a better product and friendlier staff.\n\nI am looking forward to spending happy hour here one day as it runs from 3 - 7pm and offers $2 imports and margarita specials.  If you have not checked Chico's out, just do it!  When there don't forget the salsa bar.\n\nThank you Chico's we will be back. <|endoftext|>

I really like the way this airport is laid out. The food court is awesome and they had some one playing the piano. It wAs very soothing to me especially with the stress of getting from one side of the airport to the other. I really wish they had a tram for this but the food court made up for it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me tell you why I used to love Coach and Willie's...\n\nThey used to have awesome wings that were like $6 and great drink specials every night of the week. They used to show all the local sports with the sound cranked up. \n\nLast night is the last time I will go to Coach and Willies, let me tell you why:\n\n1. I sat at the bar for 6 minutes before one of the bartenders came to help me. They weren't even working the slow bar. \n\n2. The wings are now $9 and had no sauce and tasted identical to the ones at Majerle's that always give me the schlitz.\n\n3. Someone crapped on the floor in the mens room while I was there and put his pants in the toilet. The proceeded to dump an entire bottle of bleach in the mens room that made everyone in the restaurants eyes water and offered no apologies.\n\n4. I don't want to listen to your shitty R&B top 40 hits while the Suns are on. Wait, let me rephrase that. I don't want to listen to that crap ever.\n\n5. The service is overall bad. I didn't get the extra buffalo sauce I asked for. I watched the kid forget and get sidetracked on a convo with coworkers no more than 15 seconds after I asked. My cup was empty most of the meal.\n\nI hope you guys are doing well with your cholo hip hop nights you do there upstairs because you sure as hell aren't focused on customer service anymore. Or good food for that matter. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good Hibachi, MaiTai was fantastic and the service was efficient and family friendly.  I normally go for grown and sexy but I was in for a different vibe.  My girlfriend and I had a baby with us and the environment was perfect for it.  Go early otherwise you may wait for a long time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Write-ons is a girls dream come true.  Wait, I take that back... it's a girly girl's dream come true.  High end stationary and gifts for all the loved ones in life.  Not just stationary, but house warming type gifts, of candles, journals, kn-icky knacks, appetizer plates, party supplies and all sorts of fun stuff! \n\nWe ordered our wedding invitations here... they have a wide variety of choices in all budgets.  We were impressed with the selection.  We have not received our invites yet, they should be ready in about 10 days.   I am so excited to see how they turned out! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had to sleep on this one a few nights.\nI take a negative review status seriously, and to me a \""2\"" is pretty bad.\n\nThe facilities are awesome.  Outdoor bar rocks.  But right away it seemed too loud, which remined me that I may be too old.\n\n30m wait ended up being over 1 hour (Not managing expectations).\nSpinach Buns were a solid \""4\""  Yum..  Must have.\n\nVegge Spring rolls (not fried) were horrible - \""1\"".  It was like eating a shredded Daikon Radish.  There was NOTHING else in them!  Why?\n\nOrdered a chicken thing that was marginal.\nAnd a Beef (leather)  thing with noodles.\nThey served a small cup of rice that I thought was amazing.  The steamed rice was a \""5\"" for me.\n\nThe beef was remarkably like seasoned leather.  As an amateur chef I sincerely cannot decide what techniques I would employ to make it so tough and flavorless.  It would be hard to reproduce.\n\nTime to get back to basics.  This was no \""Flo's\"" or \""Changs\"".\nThe service didn't suck, but close.\n\nHoping it was just an off night, but .? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome all around. These guys know their stuff and are willing share all types of wisdom. Great selection and very competitive pricing. Highly recommend this spot over the big stores. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why do so many people in Pittsburgh love this place? The other day someone asked me... where's your favourite Vietnamese food? I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's. \n\nI don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints. \n\nI had their \""Special\"" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \""pre-mixed.\"" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \""Okay they have a different presentation style.\"" \n\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \n\nI don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.\n\nAfter reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\n\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke's on you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Okay so I've eaten here a few times now and I feel it's time to review.  I'm not a fan really. Every food experience I've had here has been mediocre, It's kind of like delivery Chinese food but Thai.  \n\nNow to describe my experience today... I ordered takeout for lunch as I was in a hurry to get back to the office.  Normally I would have ordered from another Thai restaurant around the corner but they seemed to be closed. So I decided to try Thai House again as my craving was strong. I seriously want to like this place but my pad see ew was just not very good. It was over cooked, hardly any vegetables at all, and I asked for spicy and there was no heat to my dish. The lunch special comes with a spring roll, well it was more like half a spring roll haha. Which that was the least of my worries but it wasn't any good. It's supposed to have chicken, clear noodles, and mixed vegetables. It had what looked like bok choy and that was it!!  \n\nI have some friends who like this place and I've had good that was good but  nothing special here. Essentially for me, it's like fast food quality.  I don't like giving poor reviews especially when the people there seem fairly nice, if a little out of it, but I just don't think I'll be back again!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Five dollars and thirty cents for a pulled pork sandwich with a side of sauce? Sorry, Honey Bear's, but I'm not feeling you. Why, oh why, did I go on a day when they didn't serve catfish, which I love from here. Perhaps when I blow off some steam over a sandwich this small with no side dishes costing over $5 I'll return for your fish fry. Until then, see ya. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My guess is that \""Ruth K.\"" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \""business\"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\n\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\n\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Boy was I disappointed and embarrassed. I had friends visiting from out of state, and I told them that Honey Bear's was the best bbq in town. We arrived Sunday night around 7pm. They were out of ribs...My friends ordered the rib and chicken combo. One substituted the rib tips for the ribs,  and the other friend ordered sliced beef. I ordered a half lb of pulled pork and two sides. They ended up \""finding\"" some ribs for one of the orders, but there were obviously boiled or pressure-cooked and not slow smoked.. The chicken came out 10 minutes after the rest of the food, and it was also either microwaved or pressure cooked.. My food, (which was ordered a couple of minutes after theirs) took over 30 minutes to arrive.  I overheard them telling the people sitting behind me that they were out of almost everything..\n\nThen, to top it all off, we were overcharged.  We showed them a four square check in which was supposed to get me one free side, but I was still charged for both my sides. The cashier girl was new and obviously in WAY over her head. \n\nI was so embarrassed after raving about this place, to have it be so very bad... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to love T.I.S. bookstore, but lately I am so far from a fan. I'm now an off campus grad student and I ordered a textbook for class in plenty of time which they decided to not ship because they assumed I would want to pick it up...umm hello check the adress! So I got the book super late and was unable to be prepared for class which, if you know me, you know that that really bothers me, I'm sort of anal. Also it took over 4 weeks to get the course packets all copied and sorted out, super ugh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible experience. I dropped my car off at 9:25 AM on a Saturday and there was one other person in front of me. I didn't leave until 11:05AM and was charged $99 for a synthetic oil changed. Overpriced, terrible customer service, and long wait times. Never coming back here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've had several clothing items dry cleaned here and I'm very happy with the results.  I've taken in everything from cocktail dresses to my winter coats. Every is cleaned exceptionally well at a great price and pretty quickly too. Everyone that works there are super nice and professional as well.  I highly recommend this shop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I absolutely loved this little restaurant! Its tucked away and has a very intimate atmosphere. The Italian food tastes homemade and authentic.\n\nThis is a great place for a date but not for a family. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Our poor dog, Duke, started forming a huge lump on his side in February. We started by taking him to Banfield- don't go there! The vet there told us that his condition was a \""medical mystery\"". Great, thanks. We took him to a different Banfield clinic, which didn't give us any better answers.\n\nFinally, I decided to look on Yelp for reviews of vets and find the best one. I read Dustin F's review of Dr. Ryan and decided to try her. That turned out to be a great decision. Dr. Ryan was able to quickly diagnose him (bone cancer :-( ...) and give us some medicine to take away his pain. She also consulted with other vets and a cancer specialist, to be sure she was correct.\n\nOur dog lived much longer than he was predicted to. He had to be put to sleep at the end of July. Dr. Ryan was always there for us, though. We called her every day the last week of his life. She always worked to fit us in to her busy schedule (she is popular!) and made sure we understood everything about Duke's condition. The last night he was with us, we paged Dr. Ryan and she called us back within an hour on her day off! She truly is an excellent vet and cares so much about the animals she treats. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is truly a treat in the Valley of the Sun. The Desert Botanical Garden provides a calm getaway from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. It's nice to visit during the day and browse several different exhibits throughout the park. However, my favorite part of the Desert Botanical Garden is that they offer a wide variety of lovely events throughout the year. In the fall, they host events like Beer in the Garden and Music in the Garden. In the winter, they host their well-known holiday event, Luminaris and in the spring they host a variety of Jazz in the Garden nights. Every event they organize is done well and provides a perfect evening out. \n\nIn addition to their wonderful events, I also really love their butterfly exhibit. The butterfly exhibit is charming and sweet. Plus, if you're lucky, you just might visit during a time when they are letting Monarchs loose in the exhibit and you might just get to let one free (hint: go in October). \n\nDBG is one of those places in the Valley that can easily be forgotten by locals but the grounds are beautiful and the events are a perfect activity! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I do like this airport a lot.  I mean it is huge and has a lot of shopping options.  The food choices are great and you will find an SB every few stops to keep you going.  They have the viewing area and rocking chairs if you have a long wait time for connection.  The restrooms are always clean and looked after.  A good airport to connect or travel thru. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good sushi.  Enjoyed all of it.  Great salad and soup as well.  Make reservations, esp on a weekend.  The only thing we DIDN'T like was the continual (loud) birthday celebrations. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  after my delicious first wrap, i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef.\n\nit was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured.\n\nmy salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were STALE.\n\nwtf, mate? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome inexpensive happy hour. The food is tasty - not just sushi. Great place to just hang out for awhile. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  WoW,  one star! Those are very rare for me, but here's why. The place its still looks really good and feel about it. The waiters are ill-trained. I came here with a groupon/google offer. I've always wanted to see what it is all about. I am so thankful that I was only out a few bucks and didn't have to pay full price. They screwed up my bill and took FOREVER to fix. Had to get the manager, who was very nice but about as incompetent as the serving staff. The food is very bland, the customer service is NOT horrible, but as bland as the food. Good news, I got my bill fixed after having to get in the manager involved and after a really long wait. With so many places in the vicinity don't waste your time or your money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been here on and off for years.  I am always a fan of the sician pizza.  YUM!  Love the thin crust.  The service is always good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  the bakery is okay but the service is terrible; went in on Saturday to pick up a cake I paid for and ordered on Tuesday; Waited 40 minutes and then when they finally got to me they said they had not started on the cake yet! I waited 40 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of me. 3 employees walked by and did not aknowledge the wait; They told me to come back (too bad I pre-paid for the cake) and did not apologize, just went to the next customer; there are much better European bakeries in N. Central such as Karl's or Jana's that are better bakeries and better in service <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a great shop in Shadyside with a little something for everyone.  It has lots of statuary, candles, and free trade items.  The second floor is simply filled with books on all sorts of subjects.  They seem to specialize in recovery - from addiction, abuse, etc., but they also have an even larger collection of self help and metaphysical subjects.  It's a nice local store to support when you're in the area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ordered a burger medium rare and it came out well done.  Terrible.  They have a limited menu after 5pm. Fries are pretty good though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Had the grilled chicken sandwich, the Mac & cheese with green chiles - both delicious! Accompanied by the heifeweisen for a very satisfying lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK, so I Yelp on a curve.\n\nMy expectations of quality, technique, ambiance, flavor, service, seasoning, skill, knowledge, presentation and value are directly proportionate to the dollars spent and the locality in which it is enjoyed. \n\nI can not apply the same degree of criticism at Torchy's for $10 as I do at Per Se for $500 ... although they both deserve 5 stars based on the above criteria.\n\nThis brings me to The Capital Grille in Charlotte....  \n\nDesign and decor get high ratings for the old school, old boys steak house feel. However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better. \n\nThe service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)\n\nFood ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality...... Sadly it was not.  \n\nThe menu list \""daily seafood feature\"", when I asked it was, I was told filet(beef) medallions with scallops .... sorry Chef .... that may feature seafood, but it is not a \""seafood feature\"" !  \n\nBetween the 2 of us we had - \n\nCedar Plank salmon, slightly over cooked, vastly under seasoned ( my better half rarely salts anything she did this)\n\nBone in NY ordered mid-rare, received very much on the rare side, slightly cold, flavor was good, but undercooked and served with a slightly roasted shallot that was still crunchy (not cooked enough), not the sweet, soft, unctuousness that it could have been.\n\nPotato gratin ( $10) needed an extra 15 min. in the oven, the potatoes were not cooked through... and there was a very very strong raw garlic flavor, AND there was plastic wrap inside ! .. In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.\n\nGrilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok. \n\nDessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.\n\nit was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that \n\n\""Meh. I've experienced better\"" sums it up ............ 2 stars <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It wasn't bad, it just could have been better. You cannot build a beautiful space and then just expect that you can get by on \""meh\""\n\nThe wow doesn't last <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been buying birthday cakes from here forever!  They are fantastic.  Fresh, light and healthy---well, at least you feel like its healthy since it has fruit and light airy cake.  Plus the owners are very sweet and believe in customer service!  I called yesterday to order a cake for today (a half sheet fresh mango cake), and they said that they might not have enough fresh ripe mangoes for a half sheet.  But since that was the cake I wanted, they said they would go out and purchase mangoes (ripe) to make the cake in time!  That was super sweet of the owner to go out of his way to help me out!   If you haven't been yet, stop by and dig into some deliciousness! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Service with Christopher was great, food was good! Salsa is too sweet and the fried ice cream wasn't freshly fried. Some minor changes would make this a great little place!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went to get nails done for the panthers playoff game. Wanted a black base w/ blue stripes. The younger girl did them and did a bad job. The worst part she even told me it was \""not her best\"" and she was disappointed with how she did them. The lines were all different sizes. She made an excuse that the brush was too big. She was about 3/4 of the way done and about 4 woman came in to get their nails done...the girl decided to rush through my nails to quickly get me done, i guess she figured she had already screwed up so no need to keep trying. Then I sat to dry and the owner came and sprayed some kind of quick dry on them and it caused the paint to sort of bubble up......yeah and paid about double since it was a design...even though it was my regular nails.  Only reason I would go back is for a basic manicure or pedicure...hopefully couldn't mess that up. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had a really bad experience. Went with a group of 5 for dinner, service was poor, the food wasn't very good either. We spent most of our time waiting. Our appetizer was the last thing brought out, no apology, no discount, no customer service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My friends and I refer to this place as the Aquarium.\n\nWho would've thunk one could find such an awesome exotic pet store in the middle of Champaign?\n\nI came here to see whether they had any hedgehogs, and was pleasantly surprised at everything else they had!\n\nYou find tropical fish of all sorts, koi the size of submarines, frogs, lizards, newts, snakes, spiders, birds, and pretty much any furry little creature (including chinchillas, ferrets, etc.).... and that isn't even the complete list!\n\nThe staff there is extremely knowledgeable, nice, and helpful.  Plus, if you check out Sailfin's website, you find that there's always a sale or deal of some sort going on.\n\nYou have to check this place out!  When you're driving past Neil, it's pretty easy to miss initially because the store looks like it's located in an abandoned white warehouse, but just make sure to keep an eye out for the sign on their building. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great little market that manages to carry most everything.  Makes me sorry Madison doesn't more neighborhood markets.  Surprisingly good selection of produce, ice cream, wine and beer.  Many of the cashiers seem disengaged which is too bad since so many of the customers are from the neighborhood and would probably like to make eye contact with the cashiers they see regularly.\n\nBring cash - credit cards aren't accepted. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What an amazing place, \n\nSpeed, the Apple Geniuses have hand held credit card swiping machine.  \n\nThe employees are more than helpful and knowledgeable.  Apple is becoming stronger in many ways and the stores reflect a great product and now Apple is perfecting great service.  The only thing this place is missing is a drive through window.\n\nLong lines this place is becoming like 6 flags, I remember when it was the smart people that only used Apple products.  I have a Mac book pro, been to the Mac store twice for questions not problems.  6 years running laptop, don't see any PC's doing this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If You Knew Where Our Car Goes\n\nYou'd bring yours to Los Olivos Hand wash too.  Several years ago one of my co-workers brought El Tahoe back clean after he drove around a wildland fire for 14 days.  Think dust.  Clouds of it.  Dust pounded to talcum by hundreds of passing tires, then wet to fine sticky mud by water trucks.  The car had been washed many times by a well known car wash now out of business.  It never looked as good as the day it got washed at Los Olivos.  \n\nRichard was out prescribed burning last fall filling drip torches in the back of  the same Tahoe.  Drip toch fuel is diesel and gasoline mixed. It spilled on the carpet, soaking some spots.  Then the dust stuck to it.  Los Olivos washed ithe torch fuel out.  The car smells only of smoke now.  I can't stand those car scents.  But we had many choices.  I just can't drive around in a rig smelling of pina colada and wood smoke. \n\nEl Tahoe just came back after weeks of toiling through Interstates 17 and 40 road de-icer, collecting dust and mud samples across the Colorado Plateau, and sitting under a tree hundreds of beautifully singing birds use for a night roost.  Los Olivos took it in and turned it out about as nice looking as that car will ever be.  Of course, if I did the washing, every last speck of dirt and mud would be cleaned from everywhere.  I'd take a Q-Tip to the window down near the defroster vents to get all the accumulated little vapors off the glass.  But I know where El Tahoe will go and it looks better than fine now.  Los Olivos we'll be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'd heard a lot of good things about this place so when I had the opportunity to plan an event for a group of my girlfriends Mama Ricotta's immediately came to mind!\n\nI'm happy to report that this place didn't disappoint! I'd made reservations online and they called to confirm my reservations early that afternoon. When we arrived our table was ready with no wait! \n\nOur waiter was kind enough to go over all the specials and give us time to look over the menu. For such a large party, I was glad to see that our glasses were never empty and all our orders were right when they hit the table. \n\nI ordered the lasagna. It's not your typical lasagna, they call it \""southern Italian style\"" and it's a mix of beef, veal and homemade sausage with a cheese blend on a bed of sauce. It was very meaty and cheesy as it should be with a classic sauce. I enjoyed every bite. Add to that those freaking addicting garlic roll (perfect for dipping) and I'd absolutely order it again. \n\nThere were a lot of other dishes on our table that looked amazing so I'm definitely coming back for more goodies...and some dessert! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love Farren's for it's off-the-beaten-path location and unexpectedly good food. You could say we're regulars. Enjoyed the chipotle shrimp taco special recently, but usually have one of their terrific burgers. My wife always gets the strawberry and walnut salad. It's delicious. Fortunately for me, she can never finish it. They have a good selection of beers and the service is always speedy and friendly. <|endoftext|>

Comedy club is passable at best, shit seating and the host thought he was the main event, but the local talent was OK, I guess?

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's always surprising to me when you go to a bar/nightclub/restaurant and they actually have good food! It DOESN'T surprise me when most of those food and drink items are pricey, so they better be worth it! \n\nCocktails were STA-RONG. My caipirinha was really wicked strong and my Cosmo was pretty much cranberry juice with a splash of vodka. Looking to party, here you go!  Looking to dance...meet me in the middle of the wide dance floor to drop to some pretty excellent DJ tunes.  It's nice that there's wide windows that open up in the summer that people can gawk at you dropping it from the street!\n\nI like that there's actually a business downtown that stays open past 9 pm! You'd be surprised the crowd you get here on any night of the week. Thursdays are salsa night and Friday/Saturday you get a mix up the after theater crowd and the night owls. Throw in a random Steeler (hi Charlie Batch) or Pens sighting and you've got a hip place! I love how the place is decorated like a Mad Mex restaurant that's ready to throw down on the dance floor! \n\nAlthough you will always have your creepers....case in point last night. A strange man claiming to work at Saks went around kissing our hands. But who doesn't come out of a bar without a creeper story. It just adds more flavor to the place...or a good story to tell the day after! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> aw im sad. so many places in champaign -urbana are closing down and i really wanted the great impasta not to be among them.  i'm pretty sure that it would have become a staple special occasion place for the entirety of my very long graduate school education here.\n\nthe wait staff is marvelously friendly here, to the point that they were able to handle the quirky banter that comes free with a night with my friends. they joined in and kept up!  that night they tried out a new recipe for beef stroganoff which didn't suit my friend nicolle so well.  but she was trying to be nice and said it was fine, until it wasn't.  the waiter was, of course, super wonderful about changing out her order but joined in our chastisement of her much to all of our amusement.\n\nand the food is solid, save the strogonoff. i had the eggplant napoleon and it was deeelish! don't leave impasta, i love you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I reserved a table through open table. The reservation was just right. I requested a table with a great view, and we received it. The food was visually stunning and quite tasty. It was a bit expensive. If you are going to have a drink and some wine with dinner, be prepared to spend about $100 a person. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've \""cheated\"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. \n\nTheir massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. \n\nI typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place can salvage a couple of stars from me because there are a couple of booths here with spiffy shit -- unusual, quirky, one-of-a-kind type stuff. \n\nThe major turnoff at this place was the godawful exorbitant prices. Like, I think I actually laughed out loud once after flipping over a price tag. That, and the confusing, choppy layout, along with the unsmiling staff who kept giving me the side eye as if I was going to stuff an item in my purse. Just UGH.\n\nNo thanks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. \n\nWe went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. \n\nThe place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Once again my local dominos lets me down. I call the store after according to the website my order left the store over an hour ago and the manager literally laughed when i asked for a refund. Keep my $29 Dominos bc you will never get another dime from me or anyone I know. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.\n\nAlso, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. (There's also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly.) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place has a great atmosphere - European feel, cute, quaint, not too stuffy.  Great place for a date. The prices aren't bad and the food is good, although the portions can be small.  How amazing the food is really depends on the menu of the evening, though I have not had anything bad.  Everything has been at least good, and some things excellent.  Service has also been great.  Plus, I like the prix fixe menu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Qdoba, Chipotle, and Costa Vida, are all very similar and provide the \""Subway experience\"" with Mexican food. What sets Qdoba apart is that they incorporated some outstanding sauces into their food which give you more options. Instead of having a chicken burrito, you can have a Ancho Chili BBQ Chicken Burrito, or a Spicy Quesso Chicken Burrito. There food is great and the menu gives you a lot more options than Chipotle does. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The Mrs. went to get a blender there today. The unit she wanted was not available in a box ready for purchase, only had one on the display shelf. She asked for help. The reply from boy-flunky: \""oh, they are in the back and hard to find'. Gee, could you be any more motivated? He relented and returned with negative results. Bet he looked real hard. Come on. Any you wonder why American brick and mortar commerce is failing. We are shopping on Amazon tonight. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> i love this place so much for the down home new york city corner look of it. it seriously looks like they picked this place up from manhattan and delivered it to phoenix.\n\nyes, it's small and a little cramped inside. get it to go and let me gawk at all the amazing products lined up across their shelves. so many rare types of strange delicacies i can't believe it. lutefisk! i haven't tried it but i'm going to give it a go next time i'm in there.\n\nalthough the place may look like a total bummer inside with it's computer-paper-print outs hanging all over the wall listing their food, you can't really deny the cheesiness (oh puns) of this place. they're very friendly inside and recommended i try the corned beef sandwich with melted swiss and mustard. the bread was so soft it nearly melted in my mouth and the corned beef was top notch and not extremely fatty. it was a perfect size as well, not too big and meaty but not too scrawny. packed a lotta punch. they use boars head meats, and you can't really go wrong there.\n\nprices are very reasonable too, you can get out of their unscathed for a mere ten bucks. it's community seating inside so be prepared to go cozy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place.  I've come here for the odd bits and bobs--brass casters for a piece of antique furniture (25 cents each), vintage milk glass door knobs ($30), wardrobes for a closet-less room ($40 each), a set of four wooden chairs ($10 each), etc.  If you buy something larger, they will hold it for a small fee and then the crew will load it into your truck for you.   If you're into old houses, reserve at least 30 minutes to get through the whole store and you won't be disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really not a bad deal at all. It's a real, live barber shop complete with hot towels and straight razors. The guy who cut my hair also cuts John McCain's. Brushes with greatness I guess. Yes,  you can touch me. For $20 bucks out the door it's hard to settle for the half-trained ministrations of the mass-market shopping mall hair-cutters when you can have this instead. It's the haircut of our fathers.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and dark-wood manly.\n\nThe barber shop (if not the salon) scene in Arizona seems to belong to the Russian emigres. A Russian shop at 19th Av. and Northern cut my hair for 6 years. A Russian lady in Ahwatukee cut my hair for a few months this summer. Now I go to this shop staffed and owned by Russian Jews (closed on Saturdays and yarmulkes in full effect). It's all good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This hotel was ok, the Host -Quntin was great., the room took a while to heat up. and the food was good and alot ( dinner). the cheapest thing on the menu was $12.00. The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect Pittsburgh spring night.  The charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  I had the best pasta and white clam sauce I've ever experienced, and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees, as well.  Nice find in the Point Breeze neighborhood. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  With the world of yogurt and yogurt-like joints popping up, It seems that TCBY has been left behind. It's not bad, per se.. just uninteresting. \n\nStaff a this location were sweet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best sandwiches in Phoenix. I love the building, the wine selection, the coffee, the live music and the ambience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this place!  Great food and huge portions. Love to eat here every time we Re in the South park area around breakfast time <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I eat there last week on a recommendation from a fellow employee.   I was by myself so I decided to eat at the bar.   The ambiance is very nice, the lighting is pleasant and the noise level is reasonable for carrying on a conversation.   Good section of wine.  I was pleased with the calamari appetizer.   The special fish course for the evening was sea bass over roasted sliced potatoes.    What I got was well presented but not sea bass.  It was gray, mealy, oily and tasteless.  Sea carp?  To add to the experience the potatoes were under done.  Very disappointing.   I'm curious about the Italian dishes but not interested enough to go back and try Luce again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The salads and sandwiches here are very good, but this review tipped the review from a 3-star to a 4-star when the cashier specifically asked how to spell my name when taking my order.  Very cool.  \n\nI like the variety of lunch options available here, and also a fan of turning any sandwich into a salad.  My coworkers and I always go here when travelling to Phoenix on business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stumbled in one morning (about 4 AM)  looking for something to get me started and asked the \""Baker\"" what the best Donut was. He responded that \""glazed is our best.\""\nIn the case I saw a Whipped Cream filled Glazed Donut. Combine two of my favorite food groups and I am a sucker.\n\nAbout six or seven trips later (I have lost track!) I am still absolutely in love with this combination. The Baker swears it is real whipped cream, I doubt it but I could care less it is so good!\n\nDon't miss it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Maybe we came on an off night? We used to really like their lasagna and pizza. The visit before this one, they changed brands of Gorgonzola and  the pizza was too pungent to finish.  This visit we noticed the menu is getting lighter and lighter and not for the better. Even the rolls were almost stale. Glad we did not get the bread pudding for that probably would have been off too. I will say our server was great and very attentive.  Guess I will stick to a salad, appetizers and bread pudding. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They don't seem to care about our business. They botched our delivery because they thought they didn't have the stones, even though they did.  They were rude, unhelpful, and about an hour and a half late.  They didn't think any of this was a problem.\n\nWe'll try one other local place. We have about $10k in landscaping lined up, but if the local guys are all this indifferent to small orders, I won't trust them with the large ones. Marvel certainly isn't getting a second chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am sorry to have to write a review like this for a local restaurant.  I am vegan.  I had a lunch reservation for Coronado Cafe, but decided to call ahead of time to work out any kinks in the preparation (e.g., no butter, no refined sugar, no smuggled in eggs or milk or cheese).  When I called, I thought I was lucky to have reached the owner.  I was quickly disabused.  She quipped that I should have taken the time to look up their menu online.  (By the way, of course I had, but they don't label!)  When I told her that the menu doesn't tell me everything I need to know for my diet (e.g., the butter or sugar issue), she got really exasperated and whined, \""I'm trying to help you.\""  I said that was great and I'd like the help.  She then said that they have several vegetarian items, which again I explained might not be vegan (a vegan diet is more restrictive, so just because it's vegetarian does not necessarily mean it's vegan).  I asked her, for example, to ask the chef if the veggie burger was vegan, and she said,  \""I'm the owner and I know everything about the menu.\""  So I asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said, \""I don't know.  Is a veggie burger vegan?\""  I said, \""Some are; some aren't.\""  She said, \""I don't think this is a place for you.  Don't come.\""  I didn't.  And I won't ever.  \n\nTo sum up:  The owner is rude, unhelpful, unknowledgeable about food -- and to top it all off, she refuses to talk to the chef (who could easily answer food prep questions).  Two thumbs down; two thumbs way down. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food was just ok,  the beer was overpriced, and the service was sub-par.  I've been there twice and the first time I actually stuck around to eat and drink.  On the second trip, we waited at the table 30 minutes with no service, then finally left.  I will not go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I cannot for the life of me figure out why I keep coming back to Yong's. I have NEVER arrived on the day and time my items are supposed to be done and been able to pick them up. Always an apology and a request to come back tomorrow. About half the time they screw up the work, doing careless things like sewing on patches way off center and crooked, misspelling embroidery, or forgetting portions of work. They also take FOREVER! I recently dropped off a single pair of pants that needed a hem repair on one leg where the original thread had snagged and come out. They said it would be a week.  We are talking about 90 seconds worth of work to those who are skilled at such things, so it shouldn't really take that long, but whatever.  Then I go pick them up, and they have not lined up the hem correctly so it is a bubbly break instead of a crisp one.  They also unhemmed and rehemmed the other leg that had been fine when I brought the pants in, but is now bubbly as well.  The pants do not look good and I am looking for another place to have them fixed.\n\nI think there are some major organization issues here, as the place is always a disaster and I think the reason they don't get things done is because they can't keep track of it all. Still, as inept as they are, everyone working here is extremely friendly and they are sincerely apologetic when something goes wrong. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped by here after seeing a movie across the street.  The place wasn't very busy for a late Saturday night and I think we were the only ones sitting in the bar area.  This place had some New Glarus on tap which is a must anytime I am in Wisconsin. \n\nOur server was great and got us everything we needed quickly.  It wasn't till after we were served our food that we realized we didn't have any silverware.  It took a while for our server to come back into the room but once he did we waved him down and he promptly brought out silverware for us.  \n\nWe both really enjoyed our pasta dishes.  And there was plenty of food and I ended up taking half mine home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We ate at Rennick's restaurant, with some eager anticipation because we were hungry and the menu looked decent, and it was our only option (nothing else within walking distance of hotel). We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: \""it's a tuna salad and comes cold\"". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said \""yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry.\"" She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten. Having to (mostly) pay for the food I did not eat, with not even a token attempt from the restaurant to try and fix it or get me something I liked? Total let down. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.\n\nIts a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I've stayed at this hotel several times now.  I really enjoy the convenient location to the light rail.  There are several good local spots to eat at just off the light rail's route.  The breakfast Buffett in the lobby is expensive, but pretty good.  I've had drinks at the bar down stairs, and let me tell you that you'll be paying full price for under poured cocktails.  I've never had an issue with the staff.  They've always been helpful and friendly.  They have a car service available out front, so you can roll in style, for a price.  If you have the extra cash, not a bad spot to stay. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is great.  My wife and I went there for our anniversary and it was delicious.  We had a sushi roll (don't remember which one) but it was very good.  We also had the hibachi dinner...I had chicken and steak, my wife and steak and shrimp.  Everything was VERY good.  Also, it is nice how they cook the food in front of you.  It is like a show and dinner.  Overall a great experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I do not understand how this restaurant has such high rating anywhere! I am Italian and LOVE good Italian food and make it homemade myself... I took my boyfriend to Marcellino for his Birthday and was thoroughly disappointed in almost EVERYTHING! \nFirst, on a positive note, it is a beautiful location and great atmosphere... Perfect for a romantic date.\nSecond, the negative... I do not know how they managed to make a salad taste bad, but they did... It tasted bitter and bland and lacking any real preparation. Then their pasta... There was no flavor or depth or excitement at all! I don't know about you, but Italian food is supposed to warm you from the inside out and fulfill all your senses from sight to smell and of course taste!\nWhen we finished the meal, the waiter asked us how it was, and I told him I really was not impressed and disappointed after expecting something much more. He quickly got defensive and proceeded to quote all the \""awards\"" and \""ratings\"" they have received and when I mentioned I was Italian, he said the food I was used to but be from a different region. He was rude and un-accommodating.\n\nI have no problem paying $20-$30 per plate, but only if there is quality to back it up. Do not waste your time or money if you are anticipating FABULOUS Italian food, but if you don't mind paying for a nice atmosphere and mediocre, overpriced food, then Marcellino might be your place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Soooo expensive.  They come up with arbitrary charges that end up costing an arm and a leg.  They also ripped the seam on one of my shirts in the process of cleaning it.  Would NOT recommend.  There is a $2.25 dry cleaner right down the street on Indian School that I've started going to instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Crappy's is more like it... sorry I could NOT resist!\n\nThis place is very below average.  The bar is small, good luck getting a seat, it's normally filled with regulars, who I have a sneaking suspicion drink for a reduced rate ;)   Also, the food is blah; they advertise that it is healthier because it is all baked. Um, this results in super fattening foods baked.. this does not mean it is healthy by any means, who do they think they are kidding?? LOL\n\nAnyways, as other reviewers have mentioned the decor is 1975 and wicker all over.  \n\nWith so many options in Shadyside, I don't see any reason to go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really want to love this restaurant but I really don't. I have tried it at the lunch buffet and I recently ordered rice, samosas, and naan, to accompany Indian food I was cooking at home. Sadly, both experiences were less than stellar. Bland doesn't begin to describe the food. Absolutely no taste. When I want to eat Indian food, I want to eat Indian food - not tasteless, spiceless, food. Did my Irish name cause my order to be overly Americanized?? :-) \n\nEven my little children were totally unimpressed. I am pretty sure we will not be giving this restaurant a third try. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If there were 10 Stars, I would give it 10 stars!!!!!!  Thank you Thank you THANK YOU my dearest Junior for introducing me to MacAlpines!  This is My absolute favorite Place.  Walk In here, and feel like you have traveled back in time, so amazingly kept original!  Wooden Booths with a hat rack at each end, sooo cool!!  Eat their Mouthwatering food while you sing along to the coolest oldies overhead.   I must say my favorite meal is a tie between their Egg Salad and Chicken Salad Sandwich... mmmmmmmm... oh and their split pea soup!!!  Cocunut Egg Cream Soda!!!! AND THEY SERVE THRIFTY'S ICE CREAM!! THE BEST Banana Split you will find!   And you get to shop while you wait for your food! YES! 2 rooms filled with the neatest trinkets,a room filled with amazingly classy clothes/scarves/hats/pins, a phone booth, furniature, You will want to buy it all.  You MUST check this place out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fresh, fast, reasonably priced, and flavorful! No complaints and would recommend to anyone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I grew up eating at this place, going back to the days when it was on the corner of 16th and Bethany in the spot where TexAz is today.  I would say that this place is very dependable.  The food is solid, and it's a steal.  I had a machaca burro enchilada style with an iced tea, and it set me back about $10.  It is a real Phoenix institution. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The menu has remained basically the same since Baby Kay sold the restaurant late last year.  The food is not as good and it is my understanding the new owners dismissed Chef Lou-Lou, no wonder the food sucks. The restaurant is not as clean and the food is terrible. What a waste!!! If anyone knows of a real good Cajun restaurant let me know! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is for the wireless booth in the store.\n\nHeard purchasing a phone here vs. through my service provider is cheaper and you get some extras like a case and a car charger. This is true, I believe I saved around $50 on the phone.\n\nThe complimentary case was cheap and I threw it in the trash. The car charger will definitely be useful.\n\nThe guys working the booth are very nice, helpful,and PATIENT. I witnessed them dealing with several non savvy wireless customers.\n\nWhy I won't buy here again...the supervisor running.the booth transferred my contacts over only after I asked him to do so. Then he transferred them over in some round about way so I had to accept all of my contacts 1 by 1, going through a menu page each time. After a couple of days I noticed some of my contacts didn't make it through the transfer. So to the Verizon store I go.to get the job done right. Plus at the Verizon store they go above and beyond explaining the basics of your phone before you leave. \n\nI also had to wait a few days to get my phone. It was more than the 2 day delivery that they advertise. However this didn't bother me especially since I just saved some dough. The fact that I had to go back to the store to activate my phone didn't bother me either. The unefficient transferring of my contacts and no regard to explain anything about my phone did bother me.\n\nLesson learned, pay the extra money and get everything done the same day, and go home happy and complete. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Rocking chairs, lots of glass windows, and a large selection of food choices...I wish I flew in to Charlotte more often!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Denny's + a local dive bar = The Ole Brass Rail\nThis place is nasty dog. Only had 1 beer here, but the poor ventilation left me smelling like greasy hash browns.  Was misled by the sign that indicated that this was a sports bar.   It's not, it's a sketchy dive bar in a sketchy area that for some reason specializes in breakfast food.  If you eat anything here, say your prayers before and after you eat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> THE MALL OF AIRPORTS!!!!\n\nThis airport is HUGE, I mean really! It's waaaay bigger than LAX in Los Angeles, and has so many really nice stores that you can forget that you were actually in an airport.\n\nI was simply changing flights, and didn't have much time to do any shopping, but this is a place that someone could spend the afternoon shopping in. Even the restaurants were a step up from what you would usually expect from an airport.\n\nThey should change the name to:\nCharlotte-Douglas MALL / International Airport \n\n:p <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always friendly, the staff here will usually go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Everything I've tried is great, but special note goes to the cornbread and the catfish. The collard greens are also great, slightly tangy and with a good feel, not overcooked. This is soul food without going overboard on salt and fat. Of course, they are there, just not as much as some soul food places.  I wish they had pie. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This McDonald's has the slowest staff I have EVER seen. Absolutely pathetic! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointed, big time.\n\nLocal info lauds this place as an institution.\n\nI say: pass.  The sandwich was soggy, bland, and just all-around not good.\n\nI didn't get sick from it, so that's a bonus.  \n\nChoose wisely.  Go to Meat & Potatoes instead, and order a sandwich there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place looked hopeful for authentic Mediterranean but the food just didn't live up to any expecation. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Cafe Milano. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Loved the food and drink! \n\nThe nachos with muchaca under the appetizer menu was GINORMOUS, it was so much food between the two of us, we could not finish it. The blue type margaritas that are presently on special for $2 a piece, all day, are fantastic.\n\nOur server was super cool and on top of her game and for a total of four drinks and the increadibly large appitizer, we paid $27. How can you beat that?! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One word, YUMMY!\n\nNo matter who you go with or what you are in the mood for- everyone, including your picky friend, will be pleased! They have food for everyone!\n\nCome hungry- larger than life portions! Currently picturing the meatloaf- wish I had more room in my belly!\n\nThe mushroom burger is a life changing experience! Came highly recommended by the server- award winning apparently. After experiencing it, I'm a believer!\n\nHappy Hour lasts for about a milisecond- but if you find yourself here at the right time- go for it! Bar only- but it's worth the taste and the price.\n\nCheesecake is of course awesome- but I can count the number of times I've actually had room left in my stomach to order the cheesecake on one hand. Dulce De Leche has been my \""go to\"" for years! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Upon my first trip to Urbana, the locals brought me to El Toro for dinner.  Being a city girl who has tried about a million Mexican places, granted I was drunk and it was 3am for most of those experiences, I didn't know what to expect from central Illinois.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI cruised the menu for my standby favorites but I spotted a Hawaiian fajita.  It was huge.  Seriously, I ate as much as I could and handed the rest to my boyfriend.  Even after both of us ate a ton, half the entree was still on the plate.  Wowza.  And let me tell you, it tasted great.  Perfect blend of authentic Mexican flavors and textures with a bit of a Hawaiian twist.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI'd also like to give them kudos on their guacamole.  It is so refreshing to find a place that doesn't overload the guac with lemon juice to preserve it.  I also appreciated that it wasn't too spicy, something that has been hit or miss lately.\n\nWe were there on a Tuesday night in early August so I wasn't at all surprised that they were pretty slow.  So obviously, we were well attended to and the staff seemed happy to have us there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of my favorite nail salons in town, and newly remodeled.  They have the biggest selection of  'no chip' shellac nail colors, the most staff, the most pedicure chairs, and are fast and efficient.  Very friendly staff. Love it here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Overpriced entrees, underwhelming food. My wife and I made a trip to Scottsdale to enjoy some warm weather and down time this spring. We wanted a good meal for our last night and were encouraged to read some of the reviews of this place. Owned by Italians, homemade pastas -- sounded right up our alley. Unfortunately, we were significantly disappointed. We both had pasta specials (I had the parpadelle w/ lamb ragu and she had the squid ink pasta w/ half a lobster, clams and mussels). I'm not one to complain about prices but I do have a problem with places charging big prices only to severely miss the mark on flavor. The parpadelle and squid ink pasta were $40 and $50 respectively. The parpadelle is a dish that even the swankiest restaurants in NYC charge $20 at most for. The squid ink claimed to have \""1/2 of a whole lobster\"" but we could only find a few bits of overcooked tail in it. Skimping on the lobster left a terrible impression with me and led me to believe that they're pulling a fast one on us. This feeling was further validated after the waiter came by to inform us that he asked the chef to remove the meat from the shell so \""the lady wouldn't have to get her hands dirty.\"" When the dish came, we were shocked when we didn't find an ounce of claw meat in the dish. \n\nFinally, but most importantly, the flavor. The parpadelle was decent but the \""fresh, homemade pasta\"" was way too thick. About twice the thickness that I've ever eaten (in even the crappiest of places). The thickness of the pasta coupled with the fact that it did not seem like they ever finished the noodles in the sauce left both dishes very unbalanced. Heavy on the pasta -- even though they had a heavy handed approach to the sauce.\n\nAside from the pastas, we had the cheesecake and gelato - both of which were more disappointing than the pastas. \n\nThe cherry on the top? The cheesy lounge singing performer at dinner. Really? Am I in a vegas lounge? Save the money and your palette. I'm sure there are other excellent places in Scottsdale -- I was only hoping Marcellino's was one of them. Unfortunately, it wasn't and the only folks benefitting are the owners that should be ashamed of the dishes they're putting out there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was waiting for my laundry on Ellsworth last week, when I decided to kill some time and find nearby food.  A bagel sounded good and the Bagel Factory felt like an appropriate transition from the Laundry Factory.  I'd never been to the Bagel Factory before, but figured they'd have decent bagels and their coffee had to be better than Crazy Mocha. \n\nThe place was kind of a mess.  When I entered, I saw stacked boxes topped off with cartons of bottled water and individually packaged goodies stacked in front of the bagel case, which seemed sloppy and strange. It felt like a regular storage place for new merchandise, not a new shipment in active transit.  I wondered how an establishment like this could afford to exist on Ellsworth Ave, a neighborhood that is trying to exude upper-class image. Once I looked up from the hoarded pile of shit blocking the counter, my eyes skimmed over the mass of individually wrapped frosted cookies covering the other counter. My mind was taken to the memory of an off-roading experience a few years back; those times when you're driving down the highway in say western Illinois, and you end up at some shabby mom-and-pop bakery, like this one, and you think to yourself \""I'm having a unique experience...\""\n\nGiven that I was coming from the cleanest laundry facility I've seen in my life, these first five seconds at the Bagel Factory were perhaps moderately surprising.  The woman behind the counter had several projects going on and I waited for about two minutes until she asked me what I'd like.  These two minutes were a fascinating two minutes, as the man behind the register was chatting up some eight to ten year old girls.  They might have been neighborhood kids, or not.  There was a familiarity to their conversation, which was only subtly uncomfortable as his tone was sordid at worst, belittling at best.  When they got around to paying for their bagels he asked, \""are they naked or do they have cream cheese?\""  My head turned as the elder of the two said, \""cream cheese.\""  \n\nBy now I'd ordered my bagel and approach the register to pay for it and he says to me, \""got a lotta earrings there, bet you set off all sorts of metal detectors.\""  I responded with \""not really,\"" as I handed him my credit card and he handed me a coffee cup.  He printed my receipt, tore it from the spool and said in a sleazy tone, \""paper trail...\""  I typically would have reacted to that, but lacked the energy after my first round of finals week.  \""Be safe out there,\"" he said as I turned to walk away, which triggered a spine-tingling sensation up my back.  Had i just been sexually assaulted or blatantly judged for wearing a few hooped earrings on each ear?  I was wearing Abercrombie and Fitch, skinny jeans and sperries.  Seriously? \n\nIn the end, it makes no difference.  This guy is a creep, and my feeling is that he holds some sort of managerial role at the Bagel Factory, which leads me to conclude this place belongs out of town ten-twenty miles where this man can find animals to harass rather than little girls and college students.  I generally go out of my way to support small business and family owned operations, but this place is the exception.  I will never step foot in this establishment again.  \n\nThe bagel with cream cheese was alright and the coffee was okay but not worth $5.19. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I walked this course for $14. Granted, it was early September and hotter than the pits of hell, but what a great course for that kind of money. \n\nI'm a higher handicap player so I found the course very challenging. The staff was great and the course itself was a stunner. Beautiful views of the Buttes with almost no signs of the outside world. The course is basically tucked away in Papago Park.  \n\nBring plenty of water if you plan on walking the course and expect to get a good workout. They have carts too, with an attached cooler to keep you drinks cold. \n\nI didn't have a problem with the clubhouse being a series of trailers stuck together. There's food, beer and tables inside and everyone's friendly. What more could you ask for? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would give it zero stars if I could. Everything about this place is beyond awful. From the minute I walked into a sub below zero, freezing clinic (Hey you do know people are sick right?) to the doctor who wanted me to tell him what medicine I wanted and diagnose myself, the experience was the worse ever. In fact all of these clinics are terrible. I only go because my insurance contracts with them. I try to avoid going to Urgent Care unless I am dying. The one on Dunlap has a tad better service if you must go. If you can go to another brand of clinics, please do. If you must go to Advanced- \""STAY AWAY\"" from this one or the one in Maryvale. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yech. I wanted to give it one star but my son said that was too harsh. \n\nThe garlic bread was good, and the mussels were really good. But the Mediterrean chicken was way overcooked and  hard. My salmon was thin, overlooked, and fishy.  The house salads were passable. \n\nI think we dropped about $60. It was definitely not worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Coffee Tree Roasters has become a coffee shop staple for me to work and study. The Shadyside location has a clear garage like door for a window which they put up when the weather is nice (and even when a sprinkle of rain occurs) and I absolutely love that part of this place.\n\nThey also have in the back a conference room with all glass windows so if it is not reserved and the people around you are talking you can go in (though seems like it might need an air freshener and have a rug renovation). Next to the conference room is the bathroom which they do keep clean.\n\nWeekends are typically crazy filled with people so if you want a seat either come early or come late (opened until midnight!) though offer a lot more seating compared to other places in the area. Even when there is a long line, the cashiers have been helpful and have gotten me what I have bought so no complaints there.\n\nI'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means but not a fan of their hot lattes and their hot coffee is okay though do like their ice coffee, ice teas, hot teas and chai. Their sweets are fantastic to boot (rice krispies, wafers - which are 5 for $1, biscottis and cookies) though hope they will have more savory items for snacking (sometimes they have pita and sandwiches available for purchase). Probably good they have not offered more of a selection for snacks since I feel like I'm always eating and drinking in here anyway... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is good depending on what you're looking for. I'm going to write this from a reptile enthusiasts' view. Simply put, this place is the worst. Animals all housed improperly, I've seen some snakes that were rescued from here, it smells, and it has been this way since the 90's. If you're looking for reptiles, avoid this place! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I visited around lunch time and the food was not that good. I was expecting it to be a lot tastier. The entree was a  dry. I's a good thing I had sauce. I am sorry, but I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I honestly dont understand the appeal to this place. Its an overpriced convenience store that makes food. \n\nThe sandwiches are decent...nothing to write home about yet nothing to bash about them either...they are just plain \""ok\"". This wouldn't be a bad thing if I wanted to stop in and grab a quick bite to eat, but the prices here are beyond stupid for a mediocre sandwich. \n\nIf you are getting a Sandwich and a drink you are in the double digits. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and go eat at Jimmy John's which is 100 times better. This place is subway quality for way more money. \n\nI think their deserts aren't bad which is a positive....but the deserts are also expensive. \n\nComeon...get over yourself D&D. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You better run from this place.  The owner must be a crook!  Our house was burglarized and the police found our very expensive watch for sale at this store.  My husband went with the detective to pick up the watch and the owner was rude and arrogant.  The police told us multiple times that this business is well known for buying stolen goods off the street and they continue to buy items from criminals although the police keep coming to their store and identifying stolen goods.  If you buy something from these guys you better make sure it has papers, authenticity and can be verified that it wasn't stolen.  Too bad that a local business would do this to their own clientele. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Having been to NOLA and experiencing the amazing food scene it's hard to imagine anywhere outside of LA being able to match the quality of food; however, this restaurant is awesome.  The etouffe was spot on, shrimp and grits creamy, the Cajun popcorn was a delightful surprise and the scampi unlike any other ever tried. \n\nGreat place to celebrate or just enjoy a great taste of new Orleans. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok based on people's review I was expecting fabulous - husband and I went in one night for some soup and sammies - both of our meals were mediocre at best - won't be back until we have exhausted all other options - \n\nFood quality was ok - the bread was nothing to write home about (and is that not what makes a sammie?) - veggies were fresh and deli meat was meh.  Sorry - I wanted to love it - <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Run by college students for college students. Which is good if you are a UW student, bad for everyone else. I have seen fellow students get fat sandwiches and extras for no extra cost. While the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service.\nI only go here if I have no other choice. I suggest going down the road to University Station and hit the Subway there. Better service and sandwiches. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't consider myself a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, especially streamlined Asian-American cuisine that's one step above fast food, but I will say this. The caramel chicken takeout dish comes with a separate small container for the vegetable slaw that goes on top. There is absolutely no excuse for a piece of broken eggshell the size of a thumbnail finding its way into the slaw container. Not to mention there was raw egg goop still attached to it. This has been one of several issues I've recently had with this location's food and service. The previous two times, the pad thai I ordered contained NO tofu whatsoever, when I know that's part of the Pei Wei pad thai recipe, having ordered the exact same dish at other, more competent locations. As if to add insult to injury, when I called and spoke to the manager about the aforementioned eggshell incident, he claimed over the phone that he would refund what I paid for that meal and that the money would go back onto my credit card. Guess what never happened. And... Guess who's never going back to this sucktastic poophole ever again. Thanks a lot for your disgusting food preparation and deceitful management. If someone from Pei Wei company corporate is reading this, please do yourself and your customers a favor and FIRE the manager running this joint. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'll start off by saying Sun Up had amazing food and great beer. The problem lies with the horrible service. There were open tables that needed to be cleaned which caused a bottleneck at the door. We sat at a high top in the bar area and were completely neglected by the bar tender/waitress. We watched tables that sat down at least 20 minutes after us get there food first. We flagged down a waitress to get a status on our food and were told our food takes longer to cook (burger and shrimp tacos), it took about 35 minutes to get food which was clearly resting under a heat lamp for some time. I'm hoping this is a one off on the service because id really like to go back to try more items. I would gladly rate this place a 4 or a 5 if the service was better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I adore this Salsarita's. The food is consistent, it represents the brand well, and to top it all off the staff is fantastic. They have a greeter at the door almost every day and the staff will fulfill any request. I'm a salsa addict, and they will ad as much salsa as I want. Good food, fantastic staff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wanted to like Budget, I really did. We had a prepaid reservation, which should have expedited things. Nope. Because it was a \""busy day\"" and they only had one person handling where you could normally go for that, we were handed an old-school number and told it would be 25 minutes; we'd be waiting in line behind antyone who happened to come in. Seriously, Budget? Your competitors have check in kiosks where you can get in and out quickly. I get that it's busy; that means you gear up and staff accordingly or use technology to speed things up. Sorry, you lost me with this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I like this place. It's always crowded, but you can wait in the wine bar--if that's not also packed to the brim(which it usually is). The pizza is the best in the area--exquisite crust, nice ingredients. Pricey, though. And parking is a pain. Luckily, Mt Lebo parking tickets are like $7.00, which is what you'd pay at a downtown garage anyway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was excited to work with Carl at my tasting.  I had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad.  My 30 minute trip turned into a 40 minute trip and I was 15 minutes late.  I figured I could talk to him when I got there (rather than try to find his number while driving) and it wouldn't be a big deal.  I got there and was informed he had left for the day.  Ummm ok.  Kind of shady considering he had my number and could have informed me.  I decided I would give it another shot - maybe there was a good reason.  I called a few days later to reschedule and left a message.  Several days passed with no response.  I get that I was late but I am a customer.  I was left feeling he was very stuck up and unprofessional.  He could have said he has a late policy, wasn't available, or said anything at all.  What a waste of time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas, asparagus, and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. Good beer. Yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was really expecting more of this place.\n\nA co-worker of mine said it used to be THE place for a quick lunch and great sub. I'd forgotten my lunch one Monday and shot down 7th to give this little hut a chance.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, it smelt somewhat foul, like an old smell. The people behind the counter did have offer to help me pick out a meal or even greet me. Luckily they had some folded up menus on their counter or I woudn't have known what they served. The three stood there til I ordered, zero effort in acknowledging me as a paying customer. Finally, I ordered and the woman punched it in. For just a simple pizza sub it was roughly $8. Yikes.\n\nHad to wait a good 15-20 minutes, in which I could hear the woman popping the sub in the microwave.. yeah for fresh.\n\nWhen they handed me the sandwich I was REALLY disappointed. It was nothing more than a baguette cut down the middle, sauce and ome cheese. No meat, no seasoning, no nothing. Very disappointing place and the food wasn't that great. I actually felt really awful about myself for having ate it.\n\nWhat a bummer. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  10/15/2013: Not going back. Ever. \n\nHere's how I rate a pizza: is it better the 2nd day?  Well, I've got good news and bad news.  First, the bad news:\n\nI've visited Pat's Pizza about 20 times in the past year (12 St and Glendale Ave, Phoenix) and the food is good.  Not great, good.  A good value, or so I thought.  But CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THE 2ND DAY!\n\nBut that's not the bad news. The bad news is, I called in an order one night a few weeks ago, and they emphasized that they close at 9 and that I'd have to absolutely be there by 9.  No problem.  But then the guy, with the broad bitching in the background (and I'm not joking), reiterated - AGAIN! That I HAD to be there by 9pm.\n\n I got there at precisely 8:54pm, but was horrified to realize, in my haste to \""get there by 9pm-NO LATER!, I'd forgotten my wallet.  Sheesh.  Wasn't intentional.\n\nBut you should have seen, actually seen, the look of horror and disgust on the faces of these two schlubs.  After numerous visits, this guy knew me; the point is, I'm not hustling anyone, if I say I'll come back, I will.\n\nThere was not a hint of empathy, \""it's ok, catch me later\"", nothing.  Nothing for a regular customer, which is what I was.  I looked at the guy and said something like, \""Well, if I HAD to be here by 9, I guess there's no chance I can go home and get my wallet\"".  Again, looks of disgust.  Silence.  Disgusted slience.   So I said, \""It's ok.  It's my mistake.  And I'll never come back\"".  And I left.\n\nBut the good news is, because Pat's wouldn't trust me, allow me to pay later for the pizza, I was forced to find a new place...and I did!\n\nThat's how I found Raffaele's Pizzeria, 7019 N 19th Ave (NE corner, 19th Avenue and Glendale). This is terrific pizza and it's better the 2nd day.  I'll write a separate review for Raffaele's but know that now, for sure, I really never will go back to Pat's.  Assholes just had to get out of there by 9...\n\nWay to go Pat's.  How many customers do you have that come in 20 times in 6 months?  I hope you're happy.  I hope you're happy with that horrible woman who looked so disgusted that night.  I hope you're married to that horrible woman.\n\nI just wonder what they did with my pizza... <|endoftext|>

I love that there is equipment in the women's locker room so most days I don't have to step outside my comfort zone.\n\nThe cycle, athletic conditioning, kettlebell and strength training classes are top notch.  The yoga and Pilates classes are good - but I prefer the Dowd Y as the teachers tend to push you further and challenge you.\n\nI have to give a special shout out to the instructor Jill, whose classes are ALWAYS a challenge for all genders and body types - but she keeps it fun and always does the work with you.\n\nHarris Y is uber kid-friendly as it's in Southpark... but as someone who doesn't LOVE children under my feet and crying while I'm PUMPING IRON, they have never once gotten in my way.  Viva la resistance!\n\nI definitely recommend Harris to anyone who is a Y member! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wish you could give ZERO stars. Ordered online for delivery. Over an hour later with still no food I called. The guy said they tried calling me three times to say something was wrong with my card but no one had called me! Total lie. The online order went through and there's nothing wrong with card!\n\nOk. Changed to 2 stars.  Delivery guy just showed up with food an hour and a half after i ordered. He played like he didn't know what I was talking about. I think they hurried, made food and delivered. My kids were ecstatic so we're happy now.  But the chow mein and moo goo gai pan were the exact same things. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been a Steelers fan as long as I can remember. I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\""\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days. So NOT COOL STEELERS! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The beds were comfortable. That's about the only thing good I can say about this hotel. They have a pool, a jacuzzi, and a workout room. I guess those are good things I can say too. That's pretty much it.\n\nWe reserved a single bed room, and got a room with two beds. When we asked at the desk, they simply moved us to a different room, also with two beds. \""Well, we're all booked up,\"" we were told. \""The room we gave you will have to do,\"" the lady said as if she was doing us a favor. \n\nThe staff isn't so great. they all seem to live in the suburbs and only come into the city to work. They know nothing about the area at all, and they don't have a concierge on duty so getting helpful suggestions on where to go or what to do, even in the area directly around the hotel, is not going to happen. When asked about where to go to eat, the lady behind the counter just looked at us and pointed toward the in-house restaurant (which has decent service but sub-par food). When asked about museums and other attractions in the area, a different lady pointed toward the rack of brochures. After looking at some of the brochures and asking about a specific attraction, we were told, \""I don't know. I don't live in the city.\"" At this point, we just left the staff alone and thanked the gods for Yelp.\n\nIt was a roof over our heads. It is located near many of the places we ended up checking out. It is not a great hotel. <|endoftext|>

The beans were bad, they tasted as though they had just opened the can and poured them on the nachos.  I asked the waitress for some flour tortillas because I believe that flour tortillas tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant especially those who claim they are authentic, homemade.  Their flour tortillas were AWFUL!!! She gave me like 3 or 4, they were all stuck to each other and these flour tortillas were not homemade.  I have bought some from the store that were way better. Don't bother with this place. <|endoftext|>

I had the pleasure of stopping by the store about a dozen or so times over the past few weeks to redo my entryway and living room, top to bottom, and could not be more pleased.

I actually prefer this store to the North Scottsdale one, as I found the service and prices to be better. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ammaccapanes very bad customer will keep me from ever stepping foot inside again. I work near buy and myself and coworkers frequent it. Lindsay the bar tender and john the bouncer have alway treated me very well. Oct 6 2013 1030pm I took a friend there for a beer and wings. The male bartender put in my order and brougt me a sm pitcher of kilt. My friend got a blue moon. I was waiting for my wings it wasn't busy as I finished my 1st beer. Second beer down still no wings last half beer started and I asked bartender to cancel wings. If I can't enjoy them with the beer what's the point. He acted as if I was being an a$$. And told me he won't void it cause he will have to pay for it. All with attitude. He checked the ticket time and it was over22 min for Wings wtf. I'm not paying for them I stated. He then explained how his boss the owner makes them pay for all voids and walkouts. This is illegal. The attitude and the owner being a jack hole is why I will never return. I will miss lindsay she was always great. If the male bartenders story was true or not. I paid for the drinks gave the tender some labor advice tipped to cover the wings and left. Sad and unhappy. This place craps on it guests threw the owners bad managing and the male bartender has no clue what customer service is about. Don't waste your time or money here unless lindsay is at the bar. Really. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't know folks. I see a lot of good reviews of this place here on Yelp but my experience at this restaurant was just awful! This is your typical mom and pop place. Normally these types of places are great. Not so with this one. We walked in and were seated promptly. We had a couple of questions about the menu and our food server could not answer any of them. One of the questions was \""do you have margaritas\""? She was so clueless she didn't even know if they served margaritas or not!!! Every question we asked she kept having to run into the kitchen to have answered. Finally an older lady had to come out and help her. The older lady told us our food server had only been there a week. You're there a week and don't know what type of drinks you serve among other things? The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless.  It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad.  The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca. It is dried then ground. I would not visit here again. I've eaten at better Taco Bells.   Do not eat at this restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ate here early sep-12. Hadn't been in over a year. Why did I wait so long? Got the russell burger and it was delish. Got chips and salsa instead of fries. Very grateful to be able to do something other than fries. Our waitress was great and we were served by who I'm guessing is the owner (Mr Faren?). You can tell they are committed to having the best burgers in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was our first visit to this restaurant. It boasts a Louisiana  style menu. However this dish ( cajun platter) lacked any type of cajun spices. You can't serve red beans and rice with no gravy  and consider that to be a  Louisiana style dish. My husband ordered the New York strip and had to put salt on it because there was no flavor. I certainly have had better and I would not visit again. Overrated! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't conjure up a worthy adjective to  the degree of disappointment I experienced at this restaurant. We were drawn in by reviews telling of some of Phoenix's \""finest Italian dining\"", and were excited at the possibility of a new discovery.\n\nWhomever reviewed this restaurant and gave it more than a \""yuck\"" must have it confused with someplace else; the setting was dark and gloomy, the service  appalling, and the food would probably have been better if they had gone to Safeway's deli counter and reheated it in the microwave. \n\nWe feel obliged to warn people about this terrible place.  Do yourselves a favor, and go elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just got back from our 5 day adventures in Phoenix and I must say the facility is pretty neat. I love it... I haven't really been to many conventions centers... matter of fact this was probably my first one ... I have only been on the outside of the SD one. Maybe I should go compare the two....\n\nBut the parking is very accessible, the facility is well maintained, clean, people are very helpful there and its HUGE!!! \n\nI looooooooooove the food choices in the center, although they were a little pricey, but it was well worth the buck. I hope to visit the PCC again for another event just to see how it is ran for a different event..\n\nGreat job on the architecture as well... very nice!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not happy at all with the prints this company did for us.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  Very unprofessional and they just did not care that I was unhappy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Buy all your produce here if you want the bargain of your life.  Cilantro sometimes 4 for $1.  Today I bought avocados & mangoes 4 for $1.  They always have some great specials.  Tomatoes were 4 lbs for one dollar.  \nButcher department is good too. \nGo there in a leisurely fashion and do an aisle by aisle so you can find the best bargains that you need for your pantry.  But don't forget their produce!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We came here for their Easter buffet and it was delicious. All the food was good, a rarity for a buffet, usually they're hit or miss. The ham with apple compote was soo good, and their grilled veggies were so flavorful....I'm drooling thinking about it. This place is far for me, but I will be back for another buffet, its worth the trip! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Amazing customer service. Quick, friendly, great car selections and they give you the option to  choose which car you would like from their lot. Fast shuttle to take you to the airport. Can't believe how smooth and fast everything went. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Service was great, including providing a local 3-mile and 5-mile running maps  Breakfast was excellent. We will be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  These guys are crooks. Shop manager there said I needed a new tire and that another guy was going to come in an tell me about options available. Guy B comes in and says oh you need 2 tires so let's get some prices. I said your shop manager just said I needed one. \""Well I recommend 2.\"" I'll do with 1 thank you. Guy B says oh you're just in luck I have XYZ Brand tire for $108 per tire... I drive a PT CRUISER! I could get all 4 tires BRAND NEW up the street at they're competitors shop without hassle for $75 more. Why the hell would i pay that for 1?! This place is a joke. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not impressed. Dropped a tablecloth for a work event off here and was told would take two weeks because of the size.  Seems a bit long but this is the first time I've left a non-clothing item anywhere so, ok. \nCalled day before expected date of completion to confirm and was told it would be ready at 5pm and I said I'd be by the next am. \nI roll in and it's not done!  Pointing fingers and asking who I spoke to?  Didn't think to ask unless I was told it wasn't going to be ready.  Woman was apologetic. Writing this review in the parking lot while they press it. It was just going to be washed in cold water, hung to dry and pressed. No cost taken off the $30. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place.  Great price, great service, and awesome food.  The cornbread alone is worth the trip.   I also loved their fried chicken.  It's a bit noisy but that's because it is is full of happy diners.  Perfect spot for some casual Southern cooking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So you already know it's a 50's diner with outdoor seating, and we're in the time of year now where sitting outside late night is nice especially after the club. I've come here a lot with friends late night, and the food was always scrumptious and service excellent, but after last night I MUST PROTEST.\n\nI ordered the Bourbon BBQ Wings, a promising title appealing to my tastes exactly. They arrive with a generous bowl of ranch and a few stalks of celery. I know most people don't eat the celery, maybe that's why, so I guess carrots were out of the question.\n\nTHE WINGS WERE FROM BABY CHICKENS!!!\nI was shocked. some of them (both sections) were not 1.5 inches long, I swear. The sauce was yummy BUT I'M ANGRY ABOUT THE WING SIZE!!!! \n\nCome on 5& Diner, you're better than Long Wong's, ACT LIKE IT and serve up goodness on all fronts!\n(See my scathing review on them as well.) I want so much to write a glowing review here but NO.\n\nSo my friend got the Southwestern eggrolls. They were sliced open diagonally and nicely presented on the plate. I tried one, and eventually my friend let me have the last 2. They were hard and irritating to eat, and tasted fine for tourists as it reminded me of Rubio's or Arriba's standard. I think Jack In The Box could've put out a better product overall.\n\nAnother friend got the chicken quesedilla.\nAlthough I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.\n\nI can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.\n\nPrices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.... choose wisely. Last night I chose.... POORLY. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My 3 children and I had the pleasure of taking this tour with Tim and a great Aussie family.\nThis otherwise long 4 hour ride was fun and entertaining. Tim kept us interested by providing us with tons of facts about AZ and joking with us the whole way.  We stopped for lunch at the Indian Reservation and did some light shopping.  The Grand Canyon was spectacular and Tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way.  \nTim was the highlight of the trip.  He provided the visiting Australian family with tips on visiting Sedona and showed us some great things along the way.  He had a supply of water he kept encouraging us to drink. My daughter left our camera in the car and he graciously returned it that very night.  Thanks Tim and SouthWest for providing us with a great experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  terrible... terrible terrible terrible... funny, the food there reminded me of the end of Goodfellas where the guy ordered pasta in a restaurant and got watery noodles and ketchup... yeah, not too far off the mark here. \n\nlet me back up a bit first.... My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've lived in the Valley for 20 years and never ate here until a couple of months ago, despite it being highly recommended by a lot of people.\n\nI think I have to rethink my opinion on the people that recommended it....YUCK!!!!!! The food has no flavor and everything is covered in shredded iceberg lettuce and \""mexican cheese blend.\""\n\nPlus the restaurant looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned or changed since 1984.  I actually didn't want to touch anything.  \n\nShut this place down.  You're done. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> um, this place is great! \n\ndefinitely for the person that does not want to compromise the aesthetics of a nice set of frames!!!\n\n family operated local business, I found them on Yelp and then went in to see what they were about.\n\nI am REALLLY picky when it comes to eyewear, I have very particular taste, and definitely know what I want in a pair of glasses. I found the style of glasses I had been searching everywhere for within 2 minutes of being in the store, and trust me-no small feat! They are funky, geeky, clear acetate heaven...so pomo...aanyways, just go here! It is great! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well... today we showed up to meet some people for a yelp thing. It was supposed to be a wine tasting at 4:30. I made reservations for today at 4:30 and was not corrected either time I called, but then maybe they were busy and figured I knew the right time.\nI showed up with the Hubster and Weinski for some vino-education, only to find out that the wine tasting actually began at 3:30, not 4:30. Well, the manager, Dave, sat us at the bar and told Jeff, the bar man, to take care of us. He let us sample some wines before choosing our glasses, and they also were kind enough to throw in the cheese plate that the wine tasters were enjoying. Unfortunately they had run out of the fontina during the official tasting, so we ended up with a more expensive and very tasty cheese.\nI enjoyed the Titus Zinfandel, Hubster ordered a dessert white, and Weinski got a Chardonnay before sampling the 3 Olives well vodka. He might have a headache later on.\nThe ambiance was nice. A simple place in a great location, Cheuvront serves up a nice vino. We enjoyed our seats at the bar, the decor, and good conversation with Dave and Jeff. I caught a glimpse of the dessert tray. While one too many episodes of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares left me disappointed in pumpkin bread pudding that had been baked two days or so ago, it all looked delicious. I'll be back on an empty stomach to try the pear and candied walnut salad, chicken or veggie lasagna, and the dessert of the day.\nI'll also do my best to try something other than my new favorite, the Titus Zin. Full bodies red with hints of raspberries and blackberries. Light on the tannins, just like I like.\nIf I frequent this place, I might get even better at pretending to be a wine snob! I might even actually learn something! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place would be out of business if it were not located next to 3 hotels and the convention center. It is not completely horrible, but I would recommend walking a few blocks up to Arizona Center complex where they have 3 or 4 different choices. If you are staying at the hotels and need some quick take out, sure this place will work (across the street). But if you are on vacation and planning a sit down dinner, don't waste one of your few vaca nights here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I decided to visit the reagent square location after reading the great reviews on here and i wasn't disappointed. Parking was relatively easy to get (Tuesday afternoon). The store is well organized not too overwhelming like most thrift/vintage stores. They carried alot of Jcrew, Ralph Lauren, Ann Taylor stuff...cashmere cardis, blazers blouses etc.  But they also carried a range of  high end stuff, i spotted 2 Oscar de la Renta sweaters, some St Johns blazers, a Prada bag. They also carry some vintage jewelry, scarves and handbags. \nIf you take the time to go through the racks you will definitely score some unique HIGH QUALITY , no funky smells goodies.As far as their prices i noticed that average price was 23-35 and the major designer stuff was between 60-100.They also have a sales rack at the back (was 75% off when i was there).  I knocked off one star because i thought the prices were abit higher than i'm used to in Denver (esp on the jewelry) \n I walked out with a vintage (60's) Pucci dress($88) in perfect condition and an Adrienne Vittadini sweater ($17).  All profits go to a women's shelter which means minimal buyers remorse...hell yess!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best Gnocchi and meat sauce i've ever had.   A friend of mine, who's  a friend of Sima and Marcellino brought me here.  I'm always apprehensive about trying something new when it comes to Italian food.. but so glad I did.  They make everyone feel welcome and well taken cared of.  The servers posses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of their food offerings.  The ambiance is very nice, who knew it was in a strip mall?  My experiences are from 2006, so I'm a little late to the review table, but I had to throw my 2 cents in.  Once you get over the slight sticker shock, you will definitely contemplate how soon your return will be.  Only bummer is I believe they close during the summer months. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really like the ambiance here for breakfast but the service is TERRIBLE and they are always out of staple items, like English Breakfast tea. \n\nI had a morning business meeting breakfast here, paid the bill and tipped 20%. I asked for more tea and got charged again, okay, fair enough. I paid the additional bill but did not tip again on the $2.50, the waiter followed me outside and confronted me about why I didn't tip again on the second bill as I was standing with my client. Tacky.  Also, they need to step up the menu.  The menu is limited and not prepared very well, which is a shame, because it has a great Euro Cafe type of environment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm writing this review after not going to this place for a while.  But I thought about this place today because I just had a third mechanic today tell me that the catalytic converter was a total hack job.  It was an after market converter and not put on well at all.  And it wasn't really cheap where it makes sense that it was a horrible job.  I'd pass on this place, I moved on a while ago. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The food is excellent. The prices are very reasonable. The people are pleasant. In addition to the four tables for dining in, there is a fascinating array of groceries for sale. We always end up with a few items to take home. The ambience is fine except for the constant sound of refrigerators, which sound in need of help. This is overall a gem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Too bad that my first review on Yelp is a negative one :( . I went to Super Dragon today. I ordered Kung Poa chicken, and I could not eat it. The chicken tasted really really bad, as if they re heated it (the taste of left over chicken), also the rice comes on the side in a pot that you scoop from and it will go to other guests after you finish. well who knows if the guest before you did scoop properly with out making a mess, without coughing, sneezing or even laughing over the rice pot while scooping? I was totally unsatisfied. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I did not feel welcomed here at all.  Our server seemed impatient and annoyed with us.  He asked us immediately after sitting down what we wanted to order.  I had no idea and asked him to come back after we had time to look over the menu.  He looked horrified but went away anyway.  He came back a couple of seconds later and asked what we wanted.  I felt rushed so I ordered something I have ordered in the past.  I really wanted to try something different and read the menu  But they don't give you time for that.  \n\nThe food came out in a matter of seconds.  I thought that was a mistake so I told the person balancing the plates that was not our order.  He went and got someone who could speak English to to tell us that they were what we ordered and placed them in front of us.  I had burritos deluxe and my friend had a steak salad,  The salad came without dressing so she asked the serve for some dressing.  While not pleased he did go get her some dressing.  My burritos were boring and tasteless.\n\nThey moved their business into a doomed location.  Nothing seems to stay there for long.  This is one place that really needs to go away!  It was awful!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My family has used Tony's before for their cheap and quick oil change.\n\nHowever, I recently took my car there for an oil change and tire rotation. Upon taking the vehicle to another mechanic for other repairs (Tony's is rather pricey), it was discovered that the tires were never rotated, despite charging me to do exactly that.\n\nTony's lost a good customer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My first (and last) experience with Rick's was an interesting experience.  I am new to Champaign and called to schedule my BMW for repair to what I believed was a caliper problem.  I was told to have my tires checked first at the place where I bought them.  I explained that wasn't possible since I had moved from out of state and again repeated what I thought the problem was (I knew it was not tire related). I was again told to have my tires checked, but they did not do that there.  If there was nothing wrong, I could call him back.  Incredulous!!! Not only was he not \""super coffee-shop\"" friendly\"" as described by Tim J., but I got the impression he didn't want to be bothered!  I went somewhere else that promptly got my vehicle in ... and it was a stuck caliper!!!!  Since it was in for repairs, I also had them do some other maintenance work done - THEY  were great!  Rick's Automotive Service LOST OUT!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.\n\n I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! \n\nBut the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. \""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right.\"" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up \""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up\"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. \n\nPs. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been in this salon several times over the past couple of years.  If it weren't for a good friend stylist who worked there I'd never have given it a chance. But over all the staff members there and the manager for that matter are as rude,  pretentious and second rate as they come. My stylist is worth every penny but  the Salon is way pricey for it's local.  If it's the Aveda products your after (You have good taste) you''d be doing yourself a favor by driving the extra two miles  to Salon Tru or Scottsdale Fashion  Square. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have taken my mom here twice and was really pleased with the service each time.\nGet the shrimp wrapped in pancetta.  Yummy!\nI also crave...no...I mean...CRAVE their lobster bisque a few times a year!  It's rich, creamy, with a bit of a kick.  I always order a tub to take home with me.\nMy only gripe?  When the heck is it opened consistently?  Argh! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome tacos, but I wish they still came one at a time. I wouldn't be upset if they had pizza too...

Ok so you have to find cash . But they have a atm Damm so $2.50 for the atm fee and then $2.50 from my bank . Then $10.00 bucks for this nasty food So for all to see is a $15.00 dollar meal At BBQ King what a rip off . I walked in and thought I was going to pass out from the nasty smell of rotten onions .\n\n          They might have been great 30 or 20 years ago and I saw people eating this  this ... I do not know what it is its not food nor BBQ.Health Department must feel sorry for them any other place they would close done <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You would think that a place that has been open, in this location as long as they have might have a few things figured out.  Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:\n\nWhen there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\n\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \n\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \n\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have \""servers\"" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\n\nI won't be going back anytime soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As a former drummer in a band, this was my favorite place to play.  As a spectator, I am just as smitten.  This place is run by old school professionals who treat musicians well.  They are up front about what they want from you but they are also accommodating.  \n\nThe vibe is that of a classy dive bar.  If that makes any sense.  Anyway, the sound is great and the beer selection is decent.  I also respect that while you can see some great indie rock there, they are still dedicated to blues and jazz on the weekends.  It would contend for my favorite place ever if that rib shack in the parking lot ever seemed open on the occasions I've gone to shows. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered the hot turkey sandwich.  I should have asked exactly what kind of turkey they used (do they roast their own, turkey breast, etc.) It shows up and looks like the cook ran over to the market and picked up a package of Carl Buddig turkey, plopped it on some white bread and tossed some gravy on it.  I tried to eat it, but I could make that happen.  I called my server over and asked her for something else.  I ordered the ground sirloin plate. Basically the same thing as the turkey sandwich except there was a hamburger patty covered in gravy, mashed potatoes covered in gravy, a bowl of peas, salad and a piece of corn bread.  It was tolerable.  \n\nI suggested to the server that maybe they should get some real turkey and bump up the price a bit to make the plate a bit more appetizing.  As for the hamburger patty, could it kill them to have some ground beef in the fridge and make up a handmade patty instead of using a puny hamburger patty?\n\nThe place has some interesting food advertisements on the wall touting their excellent this and their fabulous that.  Perhaps Jerry should reevaluate what is being pushed on to the customers and perhaps the place would be a bit busier.\n\nI'm wondering how breakfast is? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stumbled across this quaint bookstore today, and as I was looking through a stack of books, the peaceful ambience of the store was suddenly shattered by the sound of the guy at the desk  screaming \""DON'T TOUCH THOSE BOOKS!  THOSE BOOKS AREN'T ON SHELVES!  Well then why are they stacked up here with no indication that they're off limits?  And as for shelves, why are you offering books for sale that are displayed, God forbid, on a table nearby?  This guy is lucky to have any customers (I was there for a good a half-hour and no one else came in) and yet he chooses to scream at the only one in the store?  I scampered out feeling humiliated and shamed, but I later realized that it was his behavior that was shameful.  Oh, and the books are way overpriced.  And the guy had Christmas music playing. In May?  I shall never return to this crazy, unwelcoming place as long as this scary man is inside it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm picky about the quality of meat, so I was disappointed when I specifically asked if the chicken parmesan sub had whole breast meat, the cashier said yes, then it turned out to be school cafeteria style chicken patty with bread crumb filler. Yuck, I should've trusted my gut and ordered the eggplant parm. K got the Italian sub. It was \""ok, not the greatest.\"" I recommend trying a different \""cheap eats\"" if you're downtown. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dr.Romine is wonderful. However if you ever have to interact with Riley the woman that does the laser skin procedures I highly suggest going elsewhere. She was rude, abrasive, and poor communicator from day 1. I came in for a spot on my face that had been there since last year. She set up a series of procedures and did not realize until the 3rd one (2 wks apart each, costing $100) that was not the treatment I needed. She never seemed to recall our initial consult and concerns and was so wrapped up in \""knowing it all\"" and attitude she never took the time to listen to the patient and what the presenting complaint truly was. The incorrect treatment was for depression or differences in the skin texture of a scar and did nothing for the actual problem, her excuse being I termed it \""a scar\"" so that's just what you get. They are the professionals and they should know what treatment to recommend and that the brown pigment was the initial complaint which I said several times since I walked in the door. To top off the attitude every time we spoke- she canceled an appointment the day before which I had planned for over a month and was the only day until November I could do it because of the down time after. When I walked in for the appt and asked why the law was in place (doctor suddemly not in the office building that day so she couldn't do it) she just stated I don't break the law for a procedure instead of explaining the reason behind it.  Extremely poor commuunication and listening skills- highly suggest going elsewhere!! <|endoftext|>

The BBQ sauce is a tangy red sauce.\n\nFood I would rate a \""3\"", I've had better, but it's not bad.\n\nLocation - this place was dirty and there was spilled BBQ on the floor near the cash register.  The cashier was aware of the spill but didn't clean it up promptly as she had to warn me to watch my step.  Another customer was complaining to them in Spanish on how they messed up his order.\n\nService/Cleanliness: 1.\n \nOverall - this place deserves a 2.\n\nWho would like this place?  Someone who's gotta have BBQ and nothing else serving BBQ nearby - it will do. <|endoftext|>

Everytime I come in here there are at least 3 or 4 cars that were in the drive thru as I walk in that are driving out f the drive thru before I even get served. I'm a honestly never come back to this location. It happens every single time I come here and it just happened again today right now. It's really aggravating when you have two clerks who are working their asses off to get the drive thru taken care of While totally blowing off the walk up people. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The sandwiches are creative, fresh and tasty ... sometimes a bit juicy for elegant eating, but hey, most of the time the place is full of students, and students don't take time for elegance, no?  The free cookie is nice, the \""no refills\"" soda policy is not.  Prices are fair.  \nBut the place is LOUD.  Uncomfortably so.  It's not the music, or even the conversation level ... it's that there is not one soft surface in the place, and sound amplifies as it bounces off glossy walls, counters, tables and floors.  It's designed that way, and lord knows why. \nThe sandwiches and salads make up for it, though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was really irritated with this place.  I called up prior to heading over for a problem with my wife to check on ER wait times.  The woman on the phone was extermely rude.  She told me she could not give me that kind of information.  When I followed up with 'Is there alot of people waiting?' I received the same answer, just with more attitude.  \n\nI followed up with an additional question about insurance.  After being transfered to admissions or billing (?), someone who should know, asking the question again, a non-answer was for some reason rudely given. \""We bill all insurances\"".  OK, thats great, are you an in-network provider for my insurance?  \""I can't answer that question!\"" ...CLICK!  She hung up on me!\n\nI would give it less stars, but I really don't know how the medical staff actually is.  Support staff needs wrk! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cheese 'n Stuff. I had the Texan and my boyfriend had the Sicilian with double meat and double cheese.  Both Sandwiches were ample in size and more than enough for any human being. His Sicilian was monstrous. Everything tasted fresh and was FAR better than any sandwich you could get at a chain sub shop. \n\nWe also had the house-made lemonade (delicious) and both the German potato salad and traditional American Potato salad. I wouldn't buy any of these bound salads again. The German Potato Salad tasted like warmed, thin cut red potatoes in pre-made, store bought Italian dressing. Oh and it also contained bacon bits and was very vinegary and very sweet.  The American potato salad tasted EXACTLY like the Resers  potato salad you get in your local grocer's deli or amongst the other pre-made salads. Although it did seem they mixed it with extra yellow mustard. Same tangy miracle-whippy taste - same weird texture oddly toothsome potatoes. And little bits of red bell pepper. The macaroni salad also looked the same.\n\nThey did have an interesting assortment of sodas (celery soda,anyone?) along with the usual suspects.  And if you need a meat or cheese plate or both- they do that too!\n\nThis place is the quintessential mom and pop shop. Its great. Locally owned by a family who has had it for about 63 years. \n\nWe shall return! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Alice Cooper'stown is directly across the street from the US Airways Center (home to the Phoenix Suns.)  When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of \""Man vs Food\"" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22\""-long \""Big Unit\"" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.\n\nThe \""Big Unit\""--smothered in \""Nightmare\"" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalape\u00f1os, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10\"" Arizona Diamondback, Randy \""The Big Unit\"" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.\n\nThe \""Elaine Benes\"" Big Salad, the \""Johnny 'Beef' Depp\"", the \""Al McCoy\"" [\""The Voice of the Suns\"" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the \""John O'Hurley\"" [\""Seinfeld's\"" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.\n\nI will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least \""feign\"" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.\n\n\nNote to Mr. Cooper:  \n\nWhen I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came in to order a barbecue feast to eat and watch game 7, however, there was not enough meat left in this joint to order a feast:(. The biggest disappointment is that I completed a huge order just to have another employee come from the kitchen and tell me, \""Sorry we don't have x,y, and z.\"" So since the bbq joint had no bbq, I ordered a hot link sandwich and left. The sandwich was average, the service was quasi-average, and the organization of this restaurant was well below average. I'm hesitant to return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is fairly close to my hotel so I swung in for dinner on Thursday night.  At around 6 there were only 4 or 5 other people dining in, and most of them were solo diners.  I grabbed a seat - although they do have a counter you can order take out from.  I ordered a portobello pita with hummus and a side of fries.  With a drink it came to under $10!  The pita was delicious and the fries were nice and crispy.  I think this just might be my favorite place I've eaten in Phoenix so far! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Having had numerous favorable experiences at Coronado Cafe in the past, we were deeply disappointed at our most recent, and regrettably probably our last visit.  The evening was off to a great start with the predictably excellent crab cakes.  While the driver scallops were equally delicious, the chimichurri-style rib-eye was barely edible.  Despite being cooked properly - medium rare - the meat had a strange after taste.  After struggling with the steak - and subsisting on two shared scallops in exchange for some steak  - not an even trade by ANY measure - we told our waiter of the disappointment, at which point he spirited away the plate.  Since I was soon to be finished with the scallops (having shared half with my dining partner with the barely edible steak).\n\nThe waiter provided some explanation behind the problem with the steak when he advised that the chimichurri included vinegar and lime - two odd ingredients for a rib-eye, which accounted for the bitter after taste.\n\nThe response of Coronado to apparently weigh the returned entree to determine the \""discount\""  was an insult as it suggested that we should have either been forced to eat alone (i.e., return the steak after the first bite) rather than enjoy our meal together.  Had they tasted the meat rather than focused on the weight perhaps they would have realized how unpleasant the meal was.\n\nAs we have ample other dining options available to us on our \""short\"" list, we will not be returning anytime soon to Coronado\nBill and Bob Phoenix <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've only eaten at the restaurant once and have ordered takeout from here numerous time as I live about a block away.\nDine-in experience:\nI came here with a friend who raved about this place. I loved the restaurance. The atmosphere is low-key and romantic. The service is great, casual while still being professional and the food. Well It's owned by Chris Bianco (in some form or another at least) so do I really need to talk about how great the food is? Well if you're unfamiliar, the food is incredible! \n\nTake-out experience:\nI love that when I order something to go they know exactly how long it will take to be ready. It means I am not made to sit and wait while my food is being prepared and at the same time it means my food isn't sitting waiting for me to get there (their pizzas are paper thin and get lose heat quickly). The staff is always friendly and personable.\nI love that I can buy alive oils and maranara sauce there too. I'm going to try my hand at making pizza this weekend. I bought some pizza flour, maranara and oil from them yesterday. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went to see Joe Nichols last night and was disappointed in a few things.  First of all my friend and I went to the bar to get a drink and they don't accept credit cards!  What established bar/event venue doesn't accept credit?? Then the real problem arose... during the concert, some drunk idiots started causing issues.  One guy spilled his beer all over everyone around him and they were bumping and pushing people.  Someone went to get the bouncer and he just came and told the guy to stop.  Obviously that didn't do anything so the problem continued.   This was all during my favorite song which really made me mad.  The bouncer ended up coming back and getting the guys.  Later, during another GREAT song, the guys came back and pushed in front of us.  Next thing you know the guy got in a fight with all the other people around him.  It was a huge brawl and it took a good long time for any bouncers to arrive.  I felt very unsafe this whole time and it was because of the lack of awareness and/or the lack of care that the bouncers had for the well being of the patrons.  Will probably not be going back and will definitely not recommend going to any of my friends. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am from Pittsburgh, but now live in Detroit and I think about Girasole often as a special place to go when you want some great Italian comfort food, and a loud, bustling atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and you'll often see Mr. Girasole walking back and forth, checking how you like your meal and pouring more wine.  This small and very quaint Italian restaurant is located in the heart of Shadyside.  You have to walk down about 6 or 7 steps to get to the door, so if you are handicapped or elderly, it may be a tad tough.  It is a little pricey, but for good, Italian like your Mamma makes, it's worth it.  I had the pumpkin ravioli and the house salad.  I loved the salad dressing--it's light and delicious and the pumpkin ravioli was excellent as well.  I really chowed on the thick slices of Italian bread and they willingly brought lots more upon request.  We had a party of 9 and were happy to have made a reservation in advance.  Go early on a weekend evening as the wait looked treacherous by the time we left the restaurant at 7:00PM.  Girasole reminds me of eating in my Italian Grandma's basement kitchen!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the servers were a bit slow in providing basics like water and silverware in the beginning of the meal.  Otherwise, Manga! Manga! <|endoftext|>

There were hardly any concessions to choose from for food and drinks. We decided to get a hot dog that turned out to be the smallest hot dog I've ever seen. For $6 I couldn't believe it. We went to the condiment station to find no spoons or serving utensils for the onions or relish and the ketchup dispenser was broken. On top of only being able to put mustard on our hot dogs, it was a mess. We went to our seats to find there were no cup holders which made it difficult when people were walking in and out of the rows. \nI have to say that besides the friendly employees and decent parking this venue was a huge disappointment. <|endoftext|>

Spent $25.00 for two beef sandwiches, with everything, two pepsi's (medium) and a large order of fries. Just seems too high for a couple of sandwiches. Hey, I could have gone to Capital Grill for not that much more. \n\nBeef was somewhat bland today. Fries were awesome as usual, forgot to ask them to make them extra crispy...but they are good.\n\nI'm going to take a Sabbatical from Lukes to check out more interesting places. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I guess you pay for what you get...and in this case you get \""The Market District\"" marque.  I don't have much time to write a full review so I'll just post one experience:  I went to this store to purchased smoked turkey necks and/or wings to make soup.  the small package was 11.00 dollars.  I don't remember the poundage, but I remember it was enough meat to make a pot of soup.\n\nI went to the Giant Eagle that was RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, and a similar package of smoked turkey was 3 bux.\n\n:-/ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In response to the response I received from the Museum rep, I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet, but you reponded on Yelp. This week is the 3rd week. your response stated that my refund was sent this week, if you are speaking about this current week, today is the 14th, monday and the week has just begun. If you are talking about last week, can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp. Thank you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pros: Good location (Melwood, Dakota building), utilities included, they sweep the hallways.\n\nCons: Management was extremely rude and condescending when I had a problem that needed fixing. You have to take care of the A/C units, maintenance doesn't do that unless it is irreparably broken. My shower leaked, but they told me just to turn the knobs tighter ... sure dude. Still leaks. My toilet would run unless I jiggled the handle. When I moved in, I had to mop the floor 7 times to get clean water, the stovetop was caked with food, and oil was everywhere. Of course I cleaned as much to my ability, and then I got a notice saying that I wasn't keeping up with my lease b/c of some girl before me's mess. Sorry, but when the stovetop is brown from her burning shit, and I clean it to something passable, I shouldn't be penalized for this.\n\nAlso, the water was shut off multiple times unannounced, and when I mentioned it and asked if they could just send out a notice, maybe detailing future outages, or even just an email saying how long it would be, I got a snarky reply saying that \""emergencies happen, and blame the City of Pittsburgh because we won't be sending out any emails.\""\n\nNOT worth your money. Find a better management who doesn't take your money and piss on you. I never write reviews, but was so irate that I had to post this. Just treat me with respect, that's all I ask. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The employees of Best Buy are super shady. Purchased over 2000 laptop out of state. Purchased additional ram to be installed by best buy and their geek squad. I stopped by to pick up and they want to charge another $30 for the install. I can't believe how dishonest this company is. The geek squad manager implied she didn't care what the salesman from another store told me. I guess they are all independent!  Customer service is extremely lacking. I knew I should have went to Fry's Electronics! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is one of the places where I can say Japanese food has a little uniqueness to it. I like the whole Japanese Italian Cafe and Bakery look to it. It reminds me of the spin that the restaurants in Japan does too.\n\nI had the Tekka Don. Which was a sashimi rice bowl. It was good. Practically, it was a tuna roll not rolled up and put into a bowl. I used to get the Ika Mentai but that's becoming boring a bit.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice but you can definitely expect a wait. For the love of everything delicious, don't go to one of those American chains pretending to be a Japanese restaurant. :cough cough: Ra Sushi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK, for starters... I'm all about handstands and arm balances. Also, I believe that yoga is about listening to your body and doing the pose that is right for you.  Therefore, if your in a pose and you think you should go deeper than do it!  When I go to a power class and I'm told not to modify and the teacher is overweight, I get scarred that it's going to be a bad class.  Also, power yoga should be taught by type A people. You can be mellow and spiritual, then teach a restorative class. Enough ranting!\n\nYoga Pura has a nice vibe, but for starts it smells like an old gym, where are the air fresheners and sage folks? Wow!!  The people there are really nice, but the Manger that teaches power should only be allowed to teach level 1 Flow and Restorative classes. She is a very sincere woman and a had a great spirit, but she should not teach power!  Her class was so bad that I barley broke into a sweat. We spent 40 mins in ansana for an 85 min class!!!! That is nuts for a power class. \n\nI understand the owner Eric is awesome, but he needs to look who is teaching his more advanced classes. Yoga has changed and people are more advanced. This studio is behind the times.\n\nIf you want a great yoga studio in Phoenix, then your best option is AtoneYoga! Enough said. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I decided to go on a cooking and baking frenzy and this place had everything I needed in the recipes I had. I had to find these three different types of cheese to make my lasagna from scratch and the guy working at the cheese area was very helpful. He even helped me get a grated version of one of the cheeses since I didn't want to go through the hassle of grating the block of cheese. The worker at the seafood counter was also nice and friendly. I could literally spend hours here if I could due to all the variety of food selection they have here. I definitely will be back for the huge variety of pickles they sell in their barrels! This place reminds me of a Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and your typical grocery market all combined in one. I even love how they have a wine vending machine in the front! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mr. Roberts is not a place I'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out. Both times I've gone have been for bands, and both times were fairly different experiences.\n\nMy first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing. The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. \n\nMy second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there. This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside. The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense. The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. \n\nFree music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:\n- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination\n- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP\n- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck\n\nYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After being nickle and dimed about our trade-in to the point were we were about to walk out the door, our front tire goes flat the next day. After re-inflating it continues to lose air and we have to bring it to a garage due to being stranded. They showed us a defect in the tire where the side wall was bulging out the size of a golf ball. The garage mentioned that if we were on the highway we could have been killed as it would have been a total blowout. We then bring it to the Charlotte Volvo for repair and they send us a picture of another damage where someone had previously patched the tire. We then have the same sales manager for the next  2 months do the biggest finger pointing game we have ever seen. Calling and emailing that they are not responsible. Wow, 3 days after getting the car we had to have it towed and he is finger pointing. It shows what type of operation this is with no concern for our safety and the risk they put us in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The pharmacy here is the WORST!  In the last several months the service has gone down the tubes.  Routinely get the wrong medicine (and sit in the store for 10 minutes and listen to how many others this happens to)!!  Service is the worst too! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm a thrift store junkie and this particular Goodwill location is just junkie. I've never really been impressed with the finds at this location and it has that stale grandma's dead cat smell when you walk in. That being said, they seem to have an OK selection of older furniture if you're looking for something to fix up or paint. \n\nYou should really go to the one on 20th St. & Indian School if you're in this area. They just built that one about a year and a half ago and it's clean and has great stuff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great customer service! Ask for Carlos when you need to get around Phoenix he can answer all your questions & give wonderful recommendations! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The cool thing about they Rhythm Room is the variety of people there.\nAlmost every time I go, there's a girl on the dance floor...on roller skates!  Then there will be a few punk-types, rockabilly, country, of all ages.  That's the kind of place I like.\nAlso, if you get hungry, there's a guy out back in a trailer selling pork sandwiches.  Not the greatest, but perfect after a night of live music <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Here's my experience from moving out of a Barr apartment.  First they will show your apartment at a preset time (1pm daily) and will tell you that they will show it any day without previous notice. They will just show up. Every day you will sit around and wonder if you have a knock on your door from Barr wanting to show your apartment to people. I felt like I had no privacy at all. This lasted at least 2 months. \n\nBefore moving out they give you a move out checklist. I followed this to the letter and went above and beyond and was charged $377 out of $650 for CLEANING! In my Google web albums, please decide for yourself. If it wasn't for my photo's, I would not have received a dime back from Barr. In total, I settled on a refund of all but about $70 from Barr because I was simply worn out from arguing with them. If you are a current resident of Barr please protect yourself and take video, pictures, or have them walk the apartment with you! If you are considering renting from Barr, please look at my cleaning photos and then see what I was charged for after moving out. This is not an uncommon example, as you can see from other reviews.  \n\nCleaning charges:\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/110253500433385469135/BarrRealEstateCleaningCharges?authuser=0&feat=directlink\nPictures I took after cleaning: \nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/110253500433385469135/510SMattisApt107MoveOutPictures?authuser=0&feat=directlink <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm kind of shocked.  \n\nI'm an Arizona-born-native and I've been to the Zoo and the Zoolights over SEVERAL decades.  I've been bored out of my skull every time.  As an adult, I've attended these events with the youngsters because they somehow believe it's cool.  If you're looking to score husband-points, then, by all means, drag everyone there.  Your feet and legs will be sore from all the walking they make you do.  If you're looking for enjoyment, DO NOT BOTHER.  The sneaky and insidious problem is that this place is EXTREMELY expensive, and pretends that they are providing a service to the community.  Let me explain---  they truly believe that they are a worth-while value for every family dollar you're spending.  Yet, don't believe a salesman--- they wiil bend the truth every time, and smile at you while they take your dollar.  And now, on the the Big Three:\n\n1)  Price:  This is the absolute worst problem with this seemingly, family-friendly place.  I mean, who would think that a City Zoo would be trying to scalp you for cash?  Let me give you an example of a small family of 4... this can EASILY turn into a $100 day.  For a 6-8 person group of working-class families, this can easily reach over $150, and outside of a $50,000/yr income household.  If your kids bring friends, it will be even more.  You'll hear cashiers say that \""their Zoo\"" is worthy of their out-of-reach-for-the-common-man pricing.  Their answer is simply rhetoric, because, when pressed, they won't be able to explain why the price is this high for a family.  \n\nThe bottom line is that, their prices are so incredibly high, that Joe-average, and his family, cannot afford to visit this local zoo without budgeting for it over a couple of months.  Maybe we should've left our fixed-income Grandma and Grandpa at home, although that didn't seem right. \n\n2)  Service:  Everyone we met was attentive and receptive.  They seemed to genuinely want you to have a good time.  \n\n3)  Taste:  Everything we tried was tasty, although it was hard to enjoy because everything is 3 times the price that it should be.  \n\nIn Summation:  I'm not sure why this place is recommended by any kind of governmental body, as to why this is a benefit to the State of Arizona, unless they are making some kind of profit from it.  NO, WAIT, ---- they tax every transaction within the Zoo's control.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSkip this next portion if you're married with kids.  This section is addressed to some Weinee that complained about my comments where I said the $18 entrance fee was too high... \n\n     -----Since you're single, probably going double-dutch, it's no wonder why you'll be shocked by what I've said, because, \""...dude, it's only $18....\"".  That's when everyone else knows that you are alone and have no family responsibilities.  While I might envy your ease-of-movement-as-a-single-guy, please gauge your speculation on the # of your children and the # of your extended family.  For example:  5 kids, plus their total of 11 friends, plus 3 grandparents, for tickets to get in.  Include food/drink while you're there, and I don't even have a big family.  At those rates, I'm sure you'll agree, that this place is monetarily ANTI-FAMILY and prohibitively EXPENSIVE.  No, wait....  LET'S GO EVERY WEEKEND, BECAUSE I'M SINGLE ON A DOUBLE-DUTCH DATE!!!  \n\nWay to go, Commenter Weinee.----- <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Every review I have read is right on!  I had no idea what I was getting into when I stepped foot into this little family owned deli.  Old school - quality meats, great sandwiches.  The sandwiches feed two people for $8.  All I have to say is if you don't try it you are just straight foolish!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This will be quick and simple. I just went to Taylor's Cafe to purchase a gift certificate and server informed me that only a manager could  complete the transaction. That's a huge big time FAIL! Thank you for that  waste of time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you have been to any other PHO restaurant, in any other city, Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS! \n\nFor starters, the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously, would it kill you to add more rice noodles? \n\nSince we had the PHO as our Appetizers, we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid for Seafood...but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke! \n\nSuggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> we ate lunch here yesterday and everyone left happy and full!!!! it was good!!1 <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  okay, so i went back to give this place a second chance. total mistake. i am not kidding when i say that two people in the salon at the same time i was there went up to demand their money back, and that a third left in a complete huff before her nails were even done. meanwhile, the guy doing my manicure cut my cuticle so deeply i actually cried out in pain. i can't believe i actually agreed to pay when i left the salon bleeding. needless to say, i definitely won't be coming here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Came here with a group for a friend's birthday.  We decided we wanted to do family-style so we ordered some appetizers, salads, and entrees.  Our server was spot-on with service and recommendations.  Often times groups are hard to manage and the food takes very long, but not in this case!  My tea stayed full and when we left our bellies were all full.\n\nThey had some interesting items on the menu and if I ever decide to try liver it will definitely be here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is one of the best places to get a top-notch meal. Their aged steaks are cooked and seasoned to perfection. It is extremely pricey, but the size of the meat and savory taste is well worth it. This place is great for special occasion and couples. A couple will easily spend $200. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For a place that has a $75 entree I was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   That was definitely a first.  I was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. Aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  But everything else about this place is shwag.  The seared tuna - garbage, rainbow roll and Caesar salad - weak,  and the sides incredibly small.  The place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  If this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the Westin.\nI would skip it, or if you have to, get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Based on a recommendation from a friend, we've dined here a few times.  This Italian joint reminds me of the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas.  The dining room walls are covered in mirrors and the furniture is black and white.  It's dimly lit and has an intimate feel to it.  During our visits, we've had the following menu items:\n\nEscargots, $11.50\n\nMozzarella Caprese, $12.00\n\nSpaghetti w/Meatballs & Sausage, $19.50\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg#g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg\n\nTortellini, Lasagna, Gnocchi (custom made sampler appetizer)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg#OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg\n\nTiramisu\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw#BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw\n\nThe best part about our experience here is the service.  On one of our visits, when we asked the server if they had Gnocchi, he said \""We don't have it as a separate dish, but we can make something for you\"".  The Better Half ordered a plate for dinner that evening.  On another visit, the server noticed that I was on the fence between the Lasagna, Gnocchi, and Tortellini....so he brought out a small sampler plate for me so I could try all 3 before I made my decision....awesome!\n\nAs far as the food, it's pretty good.  My fav's are the Gnocchi, Tortellini, and the Spaghetti.  You can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nReturn Factor - 87% <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am only giving this two stars because I believed the hype. The burger I had was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had, and the menu--even for a carnivore like me---was too meat heavy. And we had to wait to be seated and it was not super cheap, so all these things combined make me less than thrilled with the experience. Perhaps if I had the burger cooked medium rare, things would be different, but I still crown Industry reigning king of all (Pitts) burgers. However, things are not bad by any means, they just aren't the absolute best, as I was hoping for. And there wasn't enough bread to hold the burger, causing me to do the unthinkable and use a knife! The highlight of the night though, was hearing a man refer to his wife as \""my darling\"" when she wasn't even within earshot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had high hopes for this place. Maybe it was because it was restaurant week, but I was not impressed. The only good thing I have to say is the wine I had was excellent. Our waiter was lacking and did not explain the menu or specials. I had the goat cheese salad and it was good, but did not blow me away. We we're suppose to get the sorbet between courses to cleanse our palate but it seems he forgot to bring it. When the main course finally came I had to ask for a knife and he seemed to have forgotten who ordered what, so there was a lot of shuffling of plates. I got the trout and again I was not impressed. Dessert was the same, nothing special. Maybe this place is good when it's not restaurant week but I am not sure if it's worth the price. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I recently came here for lunch with my co worker. And overall, this is a very good restaurant.\n\nThe place is huge! And seems to be very popular. \nMy co worker tried their steak salad. It has nice presentation, but she said it needed more seasonings. So on a scale of 10, she rated it 7. \nOn the other hand, I had their Wednesday's Special : Grilled chicken with salsa on top. It's really delicious, I finished the whole thing at once. The saut\u00e9 onion was fragranced and the chicken was really tender. The beans in my opinion was good, it has a different taste...I can't really tell what it is, but together with the whole meal, it was good.\n\nPrices are reasonable. Service was quick and friendly.\n\nI strongly recommend it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There is only one item at this hotel that is worth a darn.  That's the free cook to order breakfast.  That man needs a raise.  Hotels is out dated the picture they use on the web page is the hotel but at an angle that give no true representation of the actual hotel.  Rooms would not even get cool.  Old everything.  Will not be staying there again.  Plus you have to pay 9.95 a day for internet.  Really WTF why?  Cheap.\n\nThanks RICK  LOL!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \"" we have to get to Pinos!\"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our \""go-to\"" restaurant.\n\nAFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\n\nThe food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Simply put, this is, by far the best restaurant in town, and one of the top 5 in the state.  I eat out a lot, and I always look forward to eating here.  I actually had the single best dish I have ever had in my entire life here, and same goes for the best dessert I have ever had.\nI also like that the menu is never the same twice.  While I do have a favorite dish a some places, I always know that it is going t be an intelligent, pleasing, and not over sized meal.  This is a place that I go to before I go out, and I like that you can eat and function after.  I like the decor.  I have read a few reviews that did not like it, and I do understand them, but I love the Danish modern look.  It was done tastefully, and with some thought.\nIf I have one complaint it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get.  Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it.  \nI lived in Chicago for many years so I had a LOT of great food around me, and I always made a point of going there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We ate here last weekend on the recommendation of my son's professors.  They told him to 'look for the smoke\"" and we would be there.  We did follow the smoke and it smelled wonderful.  We were able to find a parking lot about two blocks away but the walk was nice.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes which is good considering the size of the place and all the people waiting.  The place is small with a large bar, dimly lit, you can watch the cooks make your food through a large window at the back of the dining room.  We couldn't get past the burger menu. There are other things on the menu but we came for burgers.  I has the blue cheese/bacon burger and it was fantastic.  The home fries were so good but they contain bacon in case your a vegetarian and don't expect it.  They are great.  My husband had a cheddar burger and it too was great.  Full bar service.  Can't wait to go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  found a bug in my rice... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Thank you God for this place.  I was starving from a very long drive from the Grand Canyon to Phoenix and was craving an enchilada.  I googled mexi-whatever cuisine somewhat near the airport and came up with Arriba.  This is a chain restaurant, so the decor/service are all acceptable.  The hostess sat us immediately and our server took our orders.  I love the unlimited chips & salsa that come with every meal.  The salsa was surprisngly good!  I ordered the rio grande enchilada with pulled pork (they call it something else, i forget).  I was delicious!  I'm actually surprised it was a bit spicey.  Normal tex-mex food here in Boston is not spicy at all, so I guess I wasn't prepared.  I ate the whole thing, but passed on the rice and beans.  That's just not my thing.  Overall, 4 stars!  Ole! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible quality and costumer service.  Bought a wallet from them, they were all nice at first but after I bought it and came back to show them some defects with my wallet they smiled at me and told me I'm pretty much out of luck.  Will never go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was over a year ago that this place ripped me off and I'm still upset about it. I dropped off a queen size down comforter thinking it would be nice to have it dry cleaned rather than hauling it to the laundromat. My husband goes to pick it up after work and hands it over to me when he gets home. I immediately say, \""This is not our comforter.\""  What they'd given to my husband was a queen size synthetic poly-filled comforter that looked like it just came from goodwill or had been used for many years as the roof of a fort. It basically looked and felt very cheap and like something you'd have around for the dog to lie on or to eat on for a picnic at the beach. . I called Arcadia cleaners right away and was told repeatedly that it was my comforter. They said that everything is tagged immediately when dropped off and my tag number matched my receipt. I was told that there are security cameras and I could come look at the tapes. I went the following day and was told over and over again by the owner that what I had been given was what I had dropped off. I showed him that on my receipt the employee had noted that what I'd dropped off was a down comforter and he said that must've been a clerical error. He showed me the security tape and it shows my comforter being tagged and carted off. I don't know how they did it but someone somehow replaced my cozy comforter with the piece of crap comforter that was sent home with my husband. The feelings of frustration and anger were so overpowering I began fantasizing about standing out front of Arcadia Cleaners with signs boycotting the place. What made all of this even worse was the owner was a total jerk. Totally full of himself. I hope whoever stole my comforter at Arcadia is cozy. It cost me $150 and a lot of time and energy. As a school counselor I have little $ and little time/energy to be dealing with stuff like this. Shame on Arcadia cleaners! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't normally stay near the airport but this time I did. My check in was smooth. My room is really nice. My bed is super comfy. Everything one can expect in a Hilton. \n\nThe only downside, no quality restaurants nearby.  But if you have a rental car, its no big deal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A good friend and I were in downtown Phoenix at lunchtime.  I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, \""What did you have in mind?\""  She said \""How about The Old Spaghetti Factory\"".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said \""Sure, I always like to try new places.\"" \n\nWe were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said \""Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.\""  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.\n\nHaving been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my \""lazy\"" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.\n\nOur waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied \""Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size.\"".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying \""I told the busboy to bring it to you.\""  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.\n\nMy friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.  \n\nSadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the \""butter\"" added nothing.\n\nAll I could think was \""Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!\"", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Typically I've come here to eat during the day and get taken care very well by a very nice and wonderful waitress, Anita. After this experience I refuse to go back unless she is the one waiting on me. The food here is great but the service can certainly be lacking. The waitress tonight was certainly busy but she didn't even make an effort to check up on us. That is even after I had to go to the bar and get a 2nd round of drinks for me and my fiance. I didn't get guacamole with my entree like I was suppose to and couldn't even get any ketchup for her fries since it's like we weren't even being waited on. I don't know if possibly we were being discriminated upon for having a Groupon, since she was checking up on everybody else and would just walk right past us. I still tipped cash but below the norm of course, and wrote on the tip line on the receipt \""disappointed\"" since the service really was. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.  She asked if I could get there any earlier, I said I would try my best, but I work until 5pm, so maybe not.  She said ok.  \n\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \n\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What's this, a fifth review of a hotdog stand?  Read on o' Downtown diners!\n\nIt figures.  The other day I was telling my Yelp friend Mike O. about my sudden lunchtime craving for encased meats.  I figured hey, it being a nice day why not get a dog with all the goodies on it and dine al fresco?  It's mid-October--how many more outdoor dining days are we gonna have?  So I got me a regular dog loaded up with all the goodies, fries, and a drink.  Mmmm-mmm good, right? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you pay with a credit card, save the receipt and check your statement.\n\nWe met friends at PCG for happy hour. We put the bill on a credit card, our friends left the tip in cash. When the credit card statement came in, PCG had added a 30% tip on top of the bill we paid. We disputed the charge. Now the bank gets to duke it out with the restaurant. We won't be back.\n\nThis is not the first time I've experienced arrogance at this establishment. I met a colleague at PCG for lunch. When we didn't leave immediately after paying the bill, the waitress told us to move to the bar. It was offensive. I should've taken the hint then. But I decided to give it a second chance. There won't be a third.\n\nI live in the neighborhood and have been to PCG regularly over the years, so I'm not a stranger. Considering the competition in that area, you'd think they'd treat their patrons with less contempt. If PCG loses business, it won't be due to the economy. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We have 5 dogs and have been using Deer Creek for vet services, as well as grooming, for over a year now.  They are always helpful and answer all of our questions.  They also have boarding and day care.  If there were ever I time I needed those services, I would feel almost as comfortable letting my fur babies stay there as I would with one of my relatives.  The staff is caring and does a great job. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tri and Lauren and Kate and the rest of the staff are truly amazing at what they do. They sincerely care about the animals that are brought in for care whether for a vet treatment or for boarding. I trust them completely with my furry members of my family. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We stopped in here for a drink on a Friday night.  One of the more authentic irish pubs i've been to.  The decor had a nice Irish feel and they had a band going at it upstairs(another example, they pronounce Smithwicks properly, if you don't understand, just ask an irishman)\n\nThey charged a $5 cover, ladies were free.  \nThe place was pretty hoppin, lots of drunk girls having a blast.\n\nWe pulled up to the bar and had a few drinks.  A nice selection at a decent price.  When it comes to Irish bars I'm always a sucker for a shot of Jameson with a Guinness chaser and they didn't disappoint.\n\nIt sounded like there was alot more fun to be had upstairs(live band, dance floor etc) but we were just to tired to check it out, maybe next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have had numerous appointments here over the past 4 years to treat breakouts, and I am less than impressed with the PA's and tx methods. You never see a dermatologist...only a PA. They don't ask questions about your skin, their exam of your skin is bare minimum, and they prescribe topicals and send you out the door. No education about possible causes & possible preventatives (other than their topical meds). This past experience with PA Kenan was ridiculous. He wouldn't prescribe oral meds, stating my skin wasn't bad enough. Well, in my opinion it is bad, and topicals are not working, and how would he know anyway because I had make-up on and he barely looked at my face. He offered nothing in regards to treating the breakout problem other than prescribing topicals & referring me to their aestatician, which neither have worked for me! If you need acne help, go to a real derma, not a PA, and another clinic if you want treatment for acne. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great lil mom and pop joint had the chicken gyro and salad. Salad was fresh and crisp gyro was tasty <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Staff did not acknowledge us in any way until we ordered, and were unable to answer basic questions about their products. \n\nWe ordered a chicken salad sandwich; it was adequate, but I've had better. It was accompanied by a small bag of off-brand kettle chips and a tiny plastic sample cup full of \""pasta salad\"", which was just some tough, flavorless penne noodles sprinkled with oregano. I expect a side dish accompanying a sandwich to be small, but seriously, a sample cup? Maybe it was intended to be decorative. \n\nWe also had a \""classic\"" smoothie, which was supposed to be made with real fruit and contain strawberries, banana and orange. It was decent, but so heavy on cheap orange juice that it overpowered the other flavors. \n\nAside from the disappointing food and lack of service, it seemed to be a nice enough space. They had some distinctive furniture and a variety of seating, including both a bar and comfy chairs around a fireplace; a private room in the back available for reservation; and a large outdoor patio featuring a sandbox for the kids. \n\nThe food seemed over-priced for the quality, but overall the pricing was competitive with other cafes in the area; while I can't recommend it for lunch, the patio might be a good place for parents to meet for coffee while their kids play in the sandbox. \n\nHonestly, I can't see any other reason to come here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had lunch here the other day and it was really pretty good, that 16th / Bethany intersection is not lacking for good restaurants either!  I went with six other people and everybody really liked it.  Smooth decor, decent service, and competently prepared food with a SW flair.  Soup, sandwiches, salads, all were a hit!!  Their brunch is the stuff of legends although I have yet to partake. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The office staff is friendly but don't return calls. There are unnecessary fees for paying rent online and the maintenance department is rude and they refuse to fix issues properly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Carmon's is the restaurant gem hidden away in Champaign. I go there with my girlfriend to eat steak and crepes. The food has been consistently good, and their specials are always interesting.\n\nThe menu is small, but for Carmon's, this is a good thing since everything on the menu is delicious. I particularly like the steak and fries, and my girlfriend often gets the beef stroganoff crepe.\n\nThe waitstaff are very talkative and interesting people, and make the place seem very friendly. It gives a pleasant atmosphere to the place.\n\nOverall if you're looking for good steak and good crepes, you can't beat Carmon's in Champaign. <|endoftext|>

By overall I mean they have excellent family style food and your run of the mill Mexican favorite's, tacos, enchiladas and such. \n\nGreat hot sauce and the best tacos I have ever had in the 10 years I have lived here. Love the family style seafood dinner as well. Great and friendly service as well! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Im not sure what store Ana S (below me) was shopping at but this store does not have a Starbucks and is not deserving of anything more than 2 stars...and the 2nd star is mainly due to its location to where i live. I have pulled up and seen homeless guys sleeping towards the east end of the building. More than once i have been approached in the parking lot for spare change. The security guards i have seen look  like they just were dropped off the short bus. Now lets go inside! It seems as though this store is not as well stocked as the two stores closest to it. The deli staff is either retarded or trained to be rude and stupid. The whole feel of the store is \""dont touch that it looks sticky\"". If i need something quick it is the obvious choice....otherwise i drive the extra couple of miles to go to the one on Camelback and the 51. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I work at a small animal hospital in the valley, so my expectations of client and patient care is really high.  Chapparral is also an equine hospital which is why I chose them to treat my horse.  The diagnosis of my horse was grim and I had to make the decision to put him down, it was an incredibly difficult time, but the staff was comforting and supportive from beginning to end.  Their compassion and thoughtfulness to the care of my beautiful boy was felt from the first person to touch him, all the way to the last.  They were gentle and kind to him, and when I knew I was going to put him down, they asked if I wanted to have some of his mane and tail to take home with me.  With tear filled eyes I said yes; they brushed his mane and tail out and braided two beautiful pieces from his mane, and braided and cut his tail for me to take home.  After cutting the mane and tail, they tied beautiful ribbon around each piece as a keep sake for me to take home.  There was so much thought in providing me something to comfort me and help remember him by.  During a very difficult time the staff was amazing and I am so grateful for the care we received while we were there.  \nFrom someone who knows the veterinary industry I want to let others know how great this hospital is, and let everyone know I strongly recommend them for care of your beloved pets.  I still have one beautiful horse left, and you can count on me using them in the future for his care as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After looking at the hotel online I was excited, the pictures looked new and very nice. I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \""conservative\"" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \""The system is temporarily unavailable.\"" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \""new\"" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \""incidentals\"" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I visited this place way before yelp even existed in the early ninety's. I much prefer non profits that don't treat employees and volunteers  in a degrading manner. A huge turn off to me although it happened some time ago, was listening to an employee being yelled at during one of my visits and insulted in ways that are reprehensible. While it was a while ago I can tell you that the person is still on staff at the shelter and actually runs the shelter so it is hard to imagine anything has changed. I also remember hearing staff talk about people who came to adopt siting how this or that person was just unfit to be a pet owner. To adopt from this shelter it seemed you needed to be a retired couple who never left home. Your life will need to absolutely center around your pet or you are a bad person. I have worked for many rescues in the past as a volunteer and I can say i have not witnessed such behavior anywhere else as I did at this shelter. Disgusting. \nThere is also the matter that the shelter was sued for ethical issues. One such suit included the care and ownership of a Hurricane Katrina Dog which the shelter took in under the understanding that they would care for the dog until the owner could come to Arizona. The Shelter decided to adopt out the animal and sited that there was not such an agreement. (www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0313...) \nThere are MANY other rescues that could use your donations. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I purchased a groupon and scheduled a massage with Todd. Their online system is less than user friendly but he was great about scheduling for me. When I arrived for my massage Todd mistook me for someone else. When I let him know that I was a new patient he took me back to the lobby to fill out paperwork. While I was filling out the paperwork he proceeded to take his sweater off so that he was just wearing an undershirt. While this is not innapropriate, it did strike me as unprofessional. His social interactions with me continued to be strange. While he was never inappropriate, he was less than professional. When I told him that I had suffered from tight painful calves he said \""Yes!\"" Again, not inappropriate but not professional. I have also never had a therapist that didnt tell me to undress to my comfort level. He just told me to undress and that he would be back  with a heat lamp. At this point, as a female about to undress for a large male, he didn't do anything to make sure that I felt comfortable. The entire interaction leading up to the massage was strange and uncomfortable.  \nThe massage itself was fine. At one point he made a slurping nose and then apologized for forgetting to swallow. The pressure was too much at times and when I told him that it hurt his response was, \""But it's so good for the tissue.\"" I will not be going back and I wouldn't recommend him to a friend. I think it's good to remember that if you are a muscular male that is working with women in vulernable positions, you need to make sure that you are professional at all times. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So the past week I've been ordering lunch here nearly everyday. I just love the food.\n\nEverytime I've gone here the food is spot on. A few of my fave sandwiches are The Royal, which is a roast beef sandwich with melted mozzarella, celery, lettuce with aioli sauce served on a yummy baguette.\nThe Champs d'Elysee is also yummy. The sandwich has red peppers, artichokes and spinach. It's a bit creamy with the cream brie and aioli sauce, but tasty. \n\nThey usually have a different home made soup everyday and most of the soups I have tried are always very good.\n\nI'm a fan of the Paisley and I hope more people discover this place. Anytime I'm in there, the place is sparse on people and I don't understand why. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am embarrassed that I don't try more items when I eat here, but I come in specifically to get the chicken fried rice. It is nothing like usual Chinese restaurant fare as it is not soaked in soy sauce, and the chicken isn't the cubes from a can. All in all, everything seems to be freshly prepared in their kitchen. The spring rolls are made here and delicious, and the scallion pancakes are another favorite appetizer.\n\nThe waitstaff has been here for years and are very good.  Anyone that walks past your table will fill your glass or take your empty plate.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice.  It seems that you have two choices in Chinese restaurants--corporate Chinese like PF Chang's, or red and gold with paper lanterns.  Baoding has it's own look, and the music is not some kind of bad kung-fu movie sound track, they play a variety of normal choices.\n\nWhen I want Chinese, this is the place for me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience\n\n--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. \n\n---- misleading advertising it boasts \""high capacity\"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. \n\nThen the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. \n\nThen there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!\n\nUgh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. \n\nI come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had a cracked line on my ac unit - got charged $100 to find it, and then the quote was for $1150 and was told to replace my entire AC system instead of fixing it.  Got a second opinion from another place and they said it was just a $400 fix including a recharge.  All Comfort Services quoted me $500 in refrigerant alone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Coup Des Tartes is a lovely little gem in the heart of Phoenix. The restaurant itself is an old 1930's farmhouse -- small and quaint. I've read some other reviews that described it as cramped (which I can understand), but my husband and I were placed at a very romantic table in the corner and felt very cozy. This is a beautiful local to celebrate a romantic occasion (my husband took me for New Years eve). \n\nOur highlights were the Brie Brulee and Mushroom Tart (which I don't think is a permanent fixture on the menu). The desserts were to-DIE-for! I swear, I'm still savoring the raspberry chocolate torte. Some day, I want to return for a 3-course dessert-for-dinner meal. \n\nOne important note: The restaurant is BYOB. The only self- conscious moment was when I felt neighboring tables giving our wine the once-over.  Given I'm uneducated when it comes to wine selection, I'm hoping my husband selected a \""nice\"" wine from our selection and that we were getting approving looks from those tables...but heck, who cares!  I loved the service, the ambiance and the food! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They have 4 gourmet cheese sticks with marinara sauce for $7.95. No, I lied, they're not gourmet, they're the frozen kind and they're awful, why would they charge so much for them?\nHowever, this place is fantastic! Lots of Christmas decorations everywhere, and I mean everywhere! They also have karaoke at 8:30, the crowd is older (your parent's age), they dance and sing along; it's a great time. They get packed so expect to stand around, the place is small but no one cares and they will hang out for a while, it's hard to get a table at this smoky \""garage\"". If you don't smoke, you can hang out at the add on but it's not as fun as the bar area. This is the place to have a good time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a neighborhood bar and grill located in Windsor Square. I like to sit at the main bar here because you always get roped into some conversation with the friendly bartenders and the folks sitting next to you. \n\nTheir regular beers are good or OK and I usually get the Trooper IPA. However, they usually have seasonal or special beers of the day, which almost always contain a double or triple IPA, which are great. \n\nAs far as food it is definitely bar food but I do enjoy their nachos (not really the best thing on the menu, I'm just a sucker for nachos), wings and fries. I do hear their fish and chips are superb as a gentleman from Vancouver wouldn't shut up about it one night.\n\nSun Up runs a lot of specials like Chili dog Monday (Chili dog and beer for $6), Wing Wednesday and Happy Hour all day Sunday. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Blah. Stayed here over Illinois Homecoming weekend, and with my friend's wedding block rate it was still ~$90/night. The room was moderately okay upon first sight...but then things just started going downhill. There were cigarette burns on our blankets, a shower that looked like it had been pulled from a foreclosed doublewide and, much to my chagrin after realizing I had forgotten mine, NO HAIR DRYER. That made for a pleasant morning of tailgating in late October. \n\nThings didn't really get bad until the day we checked out and I noticed I had some sort of rash on my torso and legs. Are. You. Kidding. After Googling bed bugs for about 20 minutes I got an email asking to fill out a survey about my stay and was not very polite. Thankfully, I got an email from the manager shortly after who wanted to \""make things right\"" and ended up cutting my bill in half.\n\nSo....good customer service after the fact...not so great hotel stay. Never again. Until next year, that is, when I'm scrambling for Homecoming weekend accommodations without a wedding discount. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Walking into Cafe Luna, it's difficult to imagine you are still in a little brick building in Campus Town. Chinese Lanterns and teal lights softly  highlighting mahogancy indicate this is not typical campustown fare. \n\nThis is the only place on campus to get tapas, flavorful Spanish style small plates, but they also have a good selection of entrees. The tapas are what I'd go to Cafe Luna for and if you order a couple they make up a full meal. The selection varies, but most include some delicious local ingredients, including local greens from Blue Moon farm's and chevre produced by the state's only artisan cheese maker. \n\nThe best things I've had here include a perfectly succulent pork shank and the flourless chocolate cake with berries. I have been impressed with nearly everything here, except for the soggy truggle fries. \n\nMany people love brunch here, but I found it only OK. The selection is smaller and the best thing is the donuts with creme fraiche. One time when my friend had her birthday here they gave our table three plates of them on the house. Mmmm. \n\nPrices are on the high end, but it is a wonderful place for a formal date or to convince guests that campustown really is a nice place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> i went here for the first time last night and had a blast...it was karaoke night and of course my drunk ass had to perform (we are the champions, by queen, in honor of the cardinals)...the crowd was smaller but decent, many new faces to me (really i don't go out to many lesbian bars)...\n\nthe drinks were decently priced (i've def had cheaper) and there are probably some nights where they have specials like $2 coronas which is easy on the wallet.\n\nthe bar is HUGE, with a big dance floor/stage area surronded by tables..the patio is big as well, with lots of tables and chairs, and the best part...a POOL TABLE!! so you can feel the burn of the smoke in your eye while shooting...i love it... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why all the hype? I am still pondering why people rave about this place after having lunch there last week.. The location is not in the best part of town, the dining area is pretty dirty (see attached pictures) and the service sucked.\n\nWe ordered a beef chimichanga, which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tiny (like 4 bites and you're done tiny).\nA bean and cheese burrito (good, but nothing spectacular) and a chorizo tostada, I will say the chorizo was excellent and I am glad because I had to fight for it. \n\nThe place was packed when we arrived so it took us about 40 minutes to order and get our food. They call out numbers for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number calling and the speaker was really loud, it was pretty annoying. \n\n\nTo pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it. They gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when I took it back the guy asked me for my number to prove I ordered it.. This was the same guy I gave the ticket to when I picked it up originally. I told him this and he sighed heavily and started picking though all the receipts in the stack... A few minutes later he locates it, rolls his eyes and hands me a new tostada..\n\nThe food was average and the service sub par. I won't be returning... And there are Panderias on every corner so being able to buy home made tortillas really didn't impress me that much.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this cute salon/spa for mani pedis. The staff is incredibly helpful and nice. \n\nPros: Wide range of nail colors, neck wrap with scented oil, better than average tea selection, very sanitary.\n\nCons: you have to make an appointment, the outcome of your nail job may depend on the skill level of the technician (little bit of a dice roll). \n\nOna side note the owner of the salon has taken the time to come up with and manufacture a 'Salon 3121' range of products. This tells me that the business is a passion not just an investment. Overall, I think this salon is striving to do right by customers and they are succeeding. Keep up the good work Salon 3121! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First time trying NY Pizza Express tonight, and I am very glad I did! \nFound a menu online to have a look at prices, very reasonable, actually I was surprised at how cheap they were. We order 2 large pies, one just mozz, the other sausage & bacon, for delivery on a Saturday evening. They gave us a 30-40 min time estimate, and were in my driveway no more than 20 minutes later! Good friendly service both on the phone, and from the delivery driver. \nPizza was great, nice slightly chewy crust, thin, but  not too thin. Good amount of sauce, and cheese tasted very fresh! It was really good. Super happy to have tried this place, now I just need to try their subs, calzones, and everything else! \nThanks NY Pizza Express! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Staff (besides assistant manager) is completely incompetent. The last few times I've been there, I have waited an absurd amount of time either to pay for my food, or receive my food. Not because there was a long line, just because the person who was supposed to do it was distracted doing something else. One time the cashier took a 5 min long phone order instead of helping me (which would've taken 30 seconds), dropped the phone, then started doing drink orders! Never even came back to the register or apologized for the wait. I could've ran out with my bagel without paying!  There are some serious communication issues at that store, and the staff needs some serious re-training. Plus it's safe to say I'm never coming back here again. Which is a shame, because it is so much closer to my house, and I love their bagels. Get it together! <|endoftext|>

I just went there tonight and above each of their parking slots and above their to go menu board are the signs that say \""1/2 price shakes after 8 pm\"" and when I went to order 4 shakes for me and my co-workers I was told that they \""Don't do this anymore, it was just a summer promotion.\""  Today is August 31st, we are in Arizona, it IS still summer!!!!  They would not honor their own advertisements!!!!  I mentioned that the signs were still up and the girl said it didn't matter that they will not honor it.  See if I go back to this Sonic ever again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great little italian restaurant with really good food. They have a pretty good lunch special. One of the best pasta dishes is Alfredo the dark. It's a creamy dish that has a spicy kick. \nIf you come in the evenings the wait can be anywhere from 20-45 minutes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nothing stood out, including the famous burnt almond torte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had color copies made here. The staff did not know the prices and then they charged me $1.50 for me to use their computer to access the file from my flash drive. The computer was so out of date it could not even read a Word 2007 file. When I looked at the copies the next morning they were misaligned and the print quality looked like a poor inkjet rather than a laser print.\n\nI called them and they said they would have to talk to the manager. When I went back after the weekend, he was not there and the clerk would not give me a refund.\n\nPoor equipment\n\nPoor attitude\n\nPoor customer service.\n\nThere are other UPS stores relatively close. I suggest you use those. I will stick to my local one in Ahwatukee. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The chips and salsa are fantastic...that's what keeps bringing us back.  This is my one year olds favorite restaurant as she loves the salsa.  The food is pretty good...I have to admit it's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's always consistently good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very nice place. Quaint little dining room next to the formal Vincent's. Their brunch menu is very small but great! Prices are shockingly low and every table gets croissants and jam. The chef brought us over a dessert sample just because. \n\nGreat weekend brunch or lunch option. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you decide to use Yellow Cab for a ride to the airport due to their $15 fare read carefully.\n\n*BOOK 2  HOURS AND 45 MINUTES IN ADVANCE*\n\nWhy? because it will take them a GOOD 45 minutes to arrive at your pick-up spot if they arrive at all. That way if they don't arrive (which has happen to me more than three times) you will have time to call another cab service. You would think I learned my lesson after the third time right? lol \n\nGreen (Discount Cab) and Uber never take longer than 15 mins. \n\nOh and don't say you want to pay with your card I swear they will give you the death stare and throw a hissy fit. They TRY to say their card read is broke, which it never really is. I've never had my card overcharged but I would have cash on hand if I were you. \n\nThey got 2 stars instead of 1 due to them being the only cab you can really take home from the airport because the others there are Apache taxi and yeeah no I'll pass. \n\nNo issues getting home from the airport with Yellow Cab probably because I don't live that far from the airport but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nNeedless to say I never call Yellow Cab for any rides I may need to the airport I am forced to use them for a ride home from the airport which I have no issues with. <|endoftext|>

They have really great sandwiches that are high quality and very tasty and they come with great customer service. This is a good place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with a client, friends or go by yourself and enjoy the free Wi-Fi. Plus they have a great little meeting room that they let people use. I use it every Wednesday for my networking group. Wonderful place and an institution in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am from the San Francisco Bay area, on business in Phoenix. Let me keep it simpler and straight to the point; Rito's makes the best wet burrito  that I have ever had, the tender seasoned beef, and rich smoky enchilada sauce is absolutley incomprable. You must be able to 'move,' in a real neighborhood so if you are the 'coorprate,' type, keep your sorry behind in the hotel! If you are, however, a real person who likes real mexcan, A Rito's burro is as good as it gets! \n\nPS-really friendly customer service, and sweethearts behingd the counter make for an even better experience! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You would think fried chicken would be simple... Absolutely horrible.  A night visit only added insult to injury. 3 waitresses and still had to return one drink for lack of alcohol. If you want to shoot pool, go during the day, otherwise, stay clear!!!\nPS: I had to remind them of the \""drink\"" to get it removed from the bill. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Long and short of it. Service was awful. Friendly enough staff, unfortunately very slow to respond, forgetful and not well informed of menu details. Seemed like a very green staff.\n\nI really liked the ambience of Houston's, busy, but not loud. It had a great vibe and a nice synergy with Merc Bar across from them. Hilstone, while nicely designed for appearance was incredibly loud.  Tables seemed smaller and more tightly packed.  You could hear everyone's conversations around you.\n\nFood was great.  Really enjoyed the sushi.  The Hawaiian Rib-eye was however tough. Ribs were great as usual.\n\nAnother issue was the check was short by $100 when it arrived.  They forgot to add what we drank and ate on the patio.  Took over 15 minutes to get it cleared up.  This place must be under new management and wait staff.  I didn't recognize anyone from the old Houston's staff.\n\nSeems way too corporate in mentality like Applebee's or Chili's.  The only reason to go there is for the food, but for some of us that's just not enough.\n\nI really hope they can turn this place around. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The worst ever!  Our food was cold and tasteless. A group of us were celebrating our daughters graduation from law school.  There were 8 of us and the restaurant was not busy.  All of our food was served cold, obviously it had sat in the kitchen.  We sent back two meals and they brought tasteless pasta dishes and kept the two expensive meals on the bill. They left the table with our  dirty dishes sitting in front of us for 40 minutes.  Once we were not happy our server disappeared as did the other staff. Due to our daughters tears when we complained, as it was her choice of restaurant and she felt responsible, we let it go and paid our bill.  I wrote them after and have gotten NO response from them.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place had availability as we were calling everyone, when we got there it has a strong odor, I asked to see where they were keeping her and they said ohh we will get someone to show u. Once the person came and got us and showed us where she was going to be I almost cried with the loudness of the dogs barking giving me a headache as she was shaking I almost wanted to say forget it but we were in a hurry. I felt as go my dog went to doggy hell. The staff was more mindset on other things then telling us about what she would be doing and if they took them out for potty breaks, I'm guessing they just go in their cage, how gross, so that was disappointing. We dropped her off at 4pm on sat and were told we can only pick her up Sunday between 3-6pm and that the first night free but we got charged for two nights?? Wtf? So we ended up paying $37.00 I never received any pic of her and when I asked about it they pretty much ignored me. I liked Ironton boarding as they seem more in tune with saying hi to your furry friend and facility was calm and collective, and only $22 a night and have the friendliest staff that are always happy to see you. Dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside. I will NEVER take my dogs to Best friend pet care ever again!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been coming to TexAz since 1985, back in the \""Lonestar Steak\"" days. Never had a bad meal, had bad service just once in all that time, and 23 years later the prices aren't that much higher either. If I'm ever convicted of murder and sentenced to death my final meal has to be the Mulligan prime rib medium rare with mashed potatoes and that to-die-for cream gravy. I take friends here and buy them dinner just to see that look on their face when they see their plate for the first time. I've had everything on the menu except the catfish and all of it is great! I'd write more but I'm hungry now. See you there... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm only half Asian so I'm not sure if my opinion counts. tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up.  yet the place was packed.  \n\nThere was enough oil on my food for me to deep fry my thanksgiving turkey, luckily it was not peanut oil otherwise i would have ask for a to go box. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. \n\nNow the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. \n\nThere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Oowee. This is some seriously great Italian. If you like your meals to take time, then this place is five stars. The food is five stars. But the slooooow service drops it a notch.\n\nOur server didn't have an extensive knowledge of the beer list. This probably shows my naivete with regard to what you're supposed to order at a restaurant like Luce, but still, a good server knows EVERYTHING, or at least acts like it. Thus, Peroni. [sigh]\n\nMy appetizer was the veal cutlets, just little thin slices of tender baby calf with a dallop of sauce and capers. I'm going to spend a few more months in Purgatory for eating veal, but MAN, it will be worth it!\n\nMy main course was the cheese rolled in pork, the Fraciti I believe it was called (I can't seem to pull up the menu online) with gnocchi. Seriously great stuff. I ended with the custard and berries, which was okay. I wouldn't send it away, but perhaps I was expecting something more after the faaaaaantastic appetizer and entree.\n\nWhew. Again, the only drawback was the 2.5 hour meal. An entire tenth of my day was spent at this restaurant. In some sense it was worth it, just be prepared. Go GO GO! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:\n\nWelcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?\n\nYeah, I'd like a Frescuit. \n\nWe ain't got no hashbrowns!\n\n...um, all I want it a Frescuit. \n\nA'ight... I'm just lettin' you know. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hotel itself is adequate.  The 2 stars are for the hotel's internet connection.  I've stayed here twice in one week and both times were frustrating in terms of the Wi Fi. The connection drops numerous times in one session and connecting can be a chore. In terms of smartphones, don't even bother. My iPhone just refuses to fully connect and I've tried everything.  I stay at hotels continuously throughout the year  and this hotel has the worst internet configuration out of them all.\n\nThe staff is great and helpful but as someone who travels for business, the Wi Fi connection is crucial to my experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I arrived at Charlotte 15 minutes before my plane was supposed to leave. I had to transfer from terminal B to terminal E. When I asked for them to hold my flight, the gate agent said that they know we're coming and not to worry. We ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane. When they came back they said that 15 minutes ago they gave our seats to standby passengers and that the PLANE LEFT 15 MINUTES EARLY! They told us that it is a transfer airport so they usually leave early. BS!  They told us that they only hold the plane if there at least 10 people missing. Luckily there was 1 more flight that night. Suck it U.S Airways <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Okay, sorry guys..but I was NOT impressed. Just happened to be in the neighborhood...so I decided to go to Chin's because I could sit outside. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. The meat in the wraps was sub-standard and reminded me of dog food. The sauce was pretty much the only good part. The fried rice was described to have veggies and shrimp and crab...when it came out, it was so obviously KRAB. Ugh. I won't be wasting my money again. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place serves excellent Low Country/Country Cooking dishes at reasonable prices - at least the prices are reasonable at lunch, $7 - $9 for a entree which comes with 2 sides and corn bread.\n\nThe Fried Chicken is excellent, The Ribs are as well, and I love the Salmon Cakes. The Fried Catfish is good, any of the Po' Boys are worth trying. The Fried Green Tomato app is nice, not as tart as some, but still good. The Collards are not to my liking, and  I've tried them twice.\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits are nice, rich and creamy. But, I was disappointed in the Shrimp Creole, was bland and watery. Service here is excellent, even when this place is busy, which it always seems to be. The ambiance is homey, though it can get a little loud. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Prantl's very disappoints me. My favorite is the mini version of their famous burnt almond cake.

Some of the cupcakes are too sweet for me but they please my friend so it is just a matter of preference for sweetness. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I found myself in Pittsburgh one Sunday morning while pursuing the baseball parks of America, and a little bit of preemptive research made it unavoidable to visit Pittsburgh and NOT have a Primanti Bros. sandwich.\n\nWhen I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed that movie since it so closely hit home to a dork like me), but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing but construction equipment and chain link fences.\n\nBut anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.\n\nSo being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of \""what is THE food for a tourist like me?\""  With a confident smirk, she simply says \""pastrami,\"" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much \""a suggestion\"" as it was \""the order,\"" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.\n\nSo in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.  But the food was good, and that's what's the most important. <|endoftext|>

I came here because I had to turn in a assignment for school and my scanner wasn't working so I figured I could get them to scan a few papers and email them to me for a buck or two. They said they couldn't do that unlike a UPS store. My options were to either pay to use there over priced computers at like 70 cents a minute with a single page scanner or they could sell me a USB and put it on the overpriced 11$ USB.. From now on I will continue to give my business to UPS stores and plan better in the future so I don't end up having to use this late night crap store again <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For the inside dining experience, McDonald's beats Burger King, hands down. In the sandwich wars, I prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac. Fries? McDonald's. Drink options? Tie. Dessert? Burger King. Play Place? BK.\n\nThis is a fair Burger King, but the thing they have going for them is that even though the dining room is open from 6 AM to 10 PM, the drive through is open 24 hours. In the middle of the night when you're working a late shift in the South Park area, there isn't much else for a meal unless you want to drive clear across town. That makes this bright lit BK a good thing. But if it's day time, I'm probably going to choose the fancy two-story McD's a block away. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  so i went through the drive-thru today, and upon ordering 3 burgers and two with just ketchup and cheese, the \""Se hablo espanol\"" working the mic kept ringing them up as \""ketchup/no mustard\"" and repeated it back like 3 times,  after saying she didn't know how to get the order right because they got a new system (NOT MY PROBLEM!) doesn't give them an excuse to mess up my order! anyway we also ordered a \""caramel apple sundae\"" the muchacha even repeated it back as \""caramel apple sundae\"" then rang it up as a \""hot fudge sundae\"" (not what i ordered!) then upon getting to the window they hand me a hot fudge sundae, after telling them about it, they go and get a caramel apple sundae with maybe an inch of ice cream and light caramel drizzle. at other McDonald's i get about 2-3x as much!!! i guess i wont be going back to this one for a while (at least until the estupido learns the \""new system\"") <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> i wish i could give a gazzilion stars!  i have minimal yoga experience, but i can honestly say peri & anna's mommy and me classes are out of this world- relaxing, informative and fun.  i feel so much better afterwards. everyone is so nice and the place just has a great vibe probably due to the great people working there! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After Nashville, this is one of my favorite airports.  It just always seems clean, friendly, easy to go from terminal to terminal, not a lot of delays since it's not in a bad winter weather region.. That's really all I ask for in an airport.  That, and a few good places to grab a cocktail pre-boarding.  There are several of those in the main area, and a nice and clean food court, plus a Body Shop and some other little boutique stores.  I've only transferred through here so cannot speak of the security and checkin services. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There is no doubt that the ambiance is better than many other optical's shops but the prices are very high. \n\nWe saw the same product in Carolina's mall in sears Optical's at a way lower price point. I am definitely disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student, they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right? Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been coming here for years.  Lately, I've been getting their miso ramen lunch special.  I always substitute rice noodles, never had an issue.  Today, i was charged regular price on the dish without being told by the server that it wouldn't qualify for the lunch special due to the substitution.  It was only $3 more for the rice nooodles, but it's more the customer service that upsets me.  As much as I love their food, they have lost a customer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First, let it be known that this is another Phoenix establishment that I have been eating at for all of my life, with the exception for the past few years while it was (sadly) closed.\n\nI really, really, really like Don Jose.  It's simple, no fuss and very affordable. And it's TASTY!  The staff has always been friendly in that \""neighborhood restaurant\"" kind of way.  They hand you menus on the way in and tell you to sit where you like.  The glasses are cheap and brown and plastic, but thanks to the efficient bus staff, never empty.  The salsa (ahem, hot sauce), and chips are simple but yet it's impossible to stop shoveling them in, meanwhile insisiting that \""I'm going to stop with this one, so I have room for my dinner.\""  And then, there's the quesdadilla - flat, thin, crispy, cheesey and delicious!  Is this the BEST mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix?  Maybe not...but what they do, they do very well!  So glad to have them back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Perhaps the best way to re-use an old post office building, make a cozy wine bar in the middle of a trendy part of town and serve a great selection of wine as well as a unique menu of assorted bruschetta.  The staff was friendly, accommodating, and extremely helpful in choosing a nice crisp Sauvignon Blanc. This is the sort of quaint bar all neighborhoods should have.  Unfortunately, it is not in my neighborhood, thus the envy I have right now for my friends out there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My friends and I ended up eating here just randomly, walking down the street to find something to eat. We were actually heading over to Ihop, but saw that Mandarin Wok had dim sum, so we stopped in.\n\nI've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of. They bring the food out to you and plates, but everything else is up to you. Get your own drinks (chrysanthemum tea, jasmine tea, or water), your own utensils, your own sauce (they had packaged soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce, usually not what I use for dim sum), and you have to get up and order at the cashier.\n\nThey should really put a sign up or make sure people know to order, a family walked in while we were half way done with our dim sum, and they just sat there. The girl who was working wasn't doing anything important but she didn't even walk over to them, give them a menu, or anything until the man called for her.\n\nAnywho, the dim sum just reaches the bare minimum for passing off as an okay meal. Perhaps in a small town it's good, but it doesn't compare to Chinatown in the Chi.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of options, only about 25 items. \n\nMy favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake. Both of which were disappointing! The shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp. The turnip cake was just off, seemed like it wasn't cooked right.  The shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small, but it tasted fine.\n\nNot entirely saddened by this experience because at least it wasn't expensive. Around $7 to share 10 dishes. I don't think we left a tip, since we really didn't have a waitress/waitor. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I haven't been to many airports in my life, so of the few that I've been to, Sky Harbor is one of the better ones. And here's why: outlet stations. If you have any kind of electronic device that sometimes acts as an extra appendage, you can appreciate the sight of a row of outlets in an airport. I can't tell you how many times I've arrived at the airport, realized my cell battery was low and panicked at the thought of my phone dying before take off and not having any buffer to airplane small talk.\n\nSky Harbor is clean and efficient with helpful signage as airport signage should be. I think I've always flown out of B or C gate and the food options are pretty good-better than your standard airport cuisine. Of course the prices are airport-appropriate (see: highway robbery), but should you be stuck there for an extended period of time, the eats won't be limited to mystery meat from the golden arches. Pretty much every restaurant I saw had a bar which is great for those of us with air travel anxiety. \n\nI don't mind stopping through Sky Harbor and should I get stuck there, I think it's one of the better airports to get stuck in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For one, the name of this bar is \""C.O. Daniel\"" - which stands for Cochrane On Daniel. It's a Cochrane bar - imagine that.\n\nIt is affectionately known as \""C.O.'s\"" or \""See Ho's\"".\nIt is a dirty dirty bar, full of underaged fratties and fratties to be, and their corresponding sorostitutes. \n\nYou will not sit on any of the toilets (unless getting the clap sounds like a fun idea to you). You will not make out with any of the basketball players that show up and drink for free all night.\n\nYou will receive free shots from your frat brothers who work there. You will stick to the floor, which is covered in a sludge of booze, puke, broken glass, and old napkins which have been ground into a slime. You will be approached by a number of unsavory types. And you will see an exorbitant amount of striped shirts, popped collars, and nearly naked 19 year old girls who are way too excited about their vodka-crans. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been going to Du Nails for the past 6 months. Tiffany has been my nail technician. During this time I have always set up my appointments in advance. Last month the owner \""Du\"" overbooked Tiffany and made me wait 30 minutes. I thought that since it was the first time no problem. 3 weeks ago I came in for my appointment and he had over booked Tiffany again and after waiting 45 minutes I was asked to wait an additional 30 minutes. I could not wait so I rescheduled the appointment. On Saturday, May 10th I had an appointment with Tiffany for 1:00pm. When I arrived at the salon the owner \""Du\"" was rude and said, \""You early, I have you down for 2:00pm\"".  I showed him my appointment card that had my appointment scheduled for 1:00pm. He had overbooked Tiffany again. Instead of apologizing he told me that he could possible squeeze me in at 1:45pm. I replied no and I left the salon. I will not be returning. I recommend that if you want good service that you choose another salon. They are not running a professional business. I got the distinct impression that they could care less whether or not I was a customer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The level of disgust I feel toward this place is hardly measurable.\n\nThe inn-keeper was huffy when I inquired about their \""no refunds after thirty minutes\"" policy. Wtf am I going to find in 30 minutes that's going to make me want my money back???\n\nI soon found out.\n\nSeminal-looking substance on the blanket in our first room... Roach in our second. Never again. I originally gave it two stars because they have free wifi, but thats barely enough to earn two, so i snatched it back. Ew. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I guess by now all you people are so used to the crappy Mexican in phoenix that you think this is the max.  I guess to each his own but my Idea of good Mexican is not soggy tortillas, food that tastes like cumin a trashy dump that is not clean, there is no way you can clean a place like this they make enough money to at least put in a decent floor, but trust me you eat what you see. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here the day before my birthday with my boyfriend, everything was delicious as usual. Probably the first time I didnt have a vey nice server, he was kind of distant, but he was on top of things for the most part, normally the servers ask if we re celebrating something but he didnt, not did he ask if we wanted an appetizer. We sat for a long time, being a server I can see how that can be a little annoying but we did leave him a 35% tip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had \""desperation\"" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal \""thanks but no thanks\"" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to \""come back in and try on the dress\""... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think one star is being HIGHLY generous for this restaurant. My family and I visited Roland's on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. It was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. My husband and I both ordered the Lobster Rolls and I order my daughter pasta from the kids menu. It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came, my husband and I both got our sandwiches, but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all, and trying to calm her down, we were giving her our food so that she had something, but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager, and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food). \n\nDon't waste your time here, especially if you have kids. The staff (minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasn't her fault) are a bunch of bozos. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm in love. The festive d\u00e9cor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.\n\nWe ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink. \n\nWe patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch!\nThe dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.\n\nFresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I need to find a way to add glittery stars around this: YUM!!!! DELISH!!!!! \n\nI recently ventured to Postino again, and it is probably the only place that I can fall in love with over and over again. Okay..a bit dramatic..but I take food seriously (if you couldn't tell). \n\nThe location and ambiance are perfect. The interior is decorated very tastefully and the selection of wine is proudly displayed. The patio is wonderful and relaxing. \n\nI was there for lunch and ordered the half panini (prosciutto and brie) with a salad (raspberry chicken). The panini was stuffed full of fresh ingredients and perfectly crunchy. The salad was crispy, with delicious chicken and sweet/tart raspberry dressing. \n\nThe service was impeccable, while all along being super friendly. This seems to be a hard thing to find these days. \n\nAnd on a sidenote...what makes Postino special is not their extravagant extensive menu, but the simplicity and thought that goes into every single ingredient. And these ingredients are of the highest grade and quality. You will not find a load of crap on your plate that you don't need or that kills the true flavors. \n\nHeaven. \n\nOr at least what I would like to eat there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have dined here a couple times.. I first took my wife there in late November for a birthday lunch after a trip the Phx Art Museum. I had stopped by there previously to pick-up some of the coconut cupcakes made by Tammy Coe also located in the same center.. Anyways, I tried the BLT with avocado and some fresh fruit. Very good, bacon is crispy and the sourdough is great.. \n\nIf your looking for a good small wine selection, check it out. I like they have some hard to find Shiraz which normally retail for $20-$30 bux elsewhere!\n\nThe cupcakes are all very good.. I like the red velvet and the coconut.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my very favorite restaurant/bar in downtown Phoenix!  It has great atmosphere from fun to semi-formal and the food is fabulous.  Even breakfast is totally de-lish! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great staff, great beer selection, beyond decent drink specials, Gyro Pizza... done! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow, after hearing about how great this place is, I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. I first went in to look around and saw a bunch of overpriced used items and when I say used I mean USED. Nine West shoes that were beat to hell and they were still asking $40.00, say what?  Needless to say I did not purchase anything. However, I had some items at home that were 'gently' used and thought I'd give the whole consignment world a shot. I took in a Coach handbag that I used 1 time, a new small Coach wallet, a new Coach key ring, a new Kate Spade makeup bag, a pair of Bandolino riding boots (vegan) worn once and pair of Calvin Klein snakeskin pumps, worn once and a new Guess handbag. Mind you, you can either take the credit at the store and keep 55% or the cash and get 45%. After emailing twice trying to get my amount owed to me and being ignored, I finally went into the store where I was redirected to go to two different registers, and over heard an employee telling a customer exactly the opposite of what was told to me about retrieving money on consignments. Anyway, all my stuff sold within the first 5 days and my grand total in cash was.......$78.00. It seemed a little low. I was expecting at least $200.00. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have taken 3 classes so far, Meg's 5:30pm Monday Class, and an All Levels class with Ellen. \n\nMeg is amazing, you feel it the second she walks through the door, her Basics class is wonderful, the poses are held long enough to really feel them and get them, she helps everyone and a lot, constantly explaining how to work the pose, deepen it or modify it. She is wonderful and I would not want to replace this class no matter how good I got!\n\nI did Ellen's 10:15am Saturday class and was challenged! The poses are still held but flow quicker from one to another. She is constantly explaining how to work the pose, and is walking around and correcting, helping and bringing her energy and enthusiasm to all corners of the room. I found it more challenging in a different way and thoroughly enjoyed it!! She is a joyful and enthusiastic teacher.\n\nI find Desert Song a wonderful, intimate and nurturing environment and I am absolutely going to continue going there. It is also 5 minutes from my house......which is yet again another huge plus!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The owner could care less about customers. He is the rudest man. The food is so so. Nothing Cajun about it. They did not use our Groupon correctly. That was fine with us, but why couldn't the server tell us. Not just toss the bill on the table and walk away. Save your money and dine elsewhere. The Cajun Yard Dog is far better, and far more Cajun cuisine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So you may feel like a cattle in line to get branded as you shuffle through the gated line on your approach to the bar, but it will be well worth it. You are here because you like delicatessen sandwiches. Whether its corned beef, pastrami, or one of those 'other' meats you will walk away satisfied. I usually order the New Yorker on rye bread with a potato pancake and a Dr. Browns cream soda. Mmmmmm <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.\n\nWe started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Average small-town diner feel in all the good and bad ways. Food tastes pre-cooked or frozen, meny is too large, service is great, and it's breakfast all day. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway. <|endoftext|>

Whatever. \r\n\r\nLook people, al dente and toss the Alfredo on the noodle. It's not all bad, but if I want to go shabby chic and chow with the family it's okay. Not my deal, though. I like Italian served in sexy dark corners of the room with my honey. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was so upset about this place that I had to write my first review today.  I went to Carolinas today and placed my order.  I waited for about 15-20 minutes.  People who ordered after me started to get their food.  So I went up to the counter to the lady calling out numbers and giving the food to the people.  She couldn't find my order.  She was starting to tell the cooks to make my order but at this point I asked for my receipt back because I wanted my money back.  The girl said without being apologetic that I needed to go over to where I ordered to get my money back.  So I went back to the guy who took the order and asked for my money back.  He didn't ask what happened just opened the cash register and handed me money.  No apologies from anybody or acknowledgment of the fact that we waited and had no food. \nI think this place has okay food but I will never go back because this food isn't SO great that I need to deal with the service that doesn't care about keeping customers happy. \nThere are much better places that I don't fear food poisoning from that are really nice to their customers.  I say the previous sentence because people who have been the place know that it isn't the nicest place.  In fact, it is the worst looking place that I have ever seen.  I can't believe I've eaten here in the past due to the way it looks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was referred to Andy's by somebody, but after reading some of the reviews I was a little bit hesitant to go in. Honestly, I am very happy I did. Despite what some reviews say, I thought the salon was very clean, and I saw the equipment being sanitized. I made a 5pm appointment, but i got there early and was seen immediately. I got a gel manicure,  Kim did the manicure, and Anne the polish. They were both extremely nice. My manicure came out perfect, and it was only $25. I will definitely be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Was decent. Girls were not very energetic but looked great.\nAt some point my wallet fell i out of my pocket and the management returned it to me cashless. I kind of expected it, but they didnt offer any kind of retribution for being robbed. Like it should happen, or.they were fully aware of it. Pretty shady <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent service.  Had a concern with the products i purchased, but the manager took ownership and helped me get everything straightened out.   Friendly staff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I been to this place twice as well as once at another location.  At this particular location the food is pretty good for lunch but the staff does not seem to be in any hurry.  When I go to the trouble to dive over to this place during a 1 hour lunch break, I really don't like waiting 15 minutes for what is more or less fast food.  The last time I was there I was kept waiting so long that I finally asked for a refund and left.  You'd think that if your chicken combo (first item on the list) is going to take more than 20 minutes to prepare that they might inform me of it, but instead they just left me standing there.  That won't happen again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Jonathan E.'s review is spot-on. I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday and couldn't resist ordering the lamb. I was expecting a hearty hunk of roast leg of lamb, as the menu mentioned the Sunday Roasts selection. Instead, the meat was merely thin-shaved slices of lamb (with plenty of fat to trim away) with gravy. The sides were o.k., but overall this dish was disappointing.\n\nIf I must eat here again, I'll order the fish and chips, although I was a bit dismayed to see that malt vinegar was not brought automatically to the table. And although we submitted three orders of fish and chips, our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again). Fortunately, we split a Scotch egg as an appetizer and that tided him over, but it was not much of a treat. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think Yvette has the right idea for an afternoon treat. The one problem is, I couldn't wait until Friday, I had to go today. It is the perfect afternoon distraction . . . er . . . um . . . I mean treat . . . perfect afternoon TREAT! \n\nThere was a time that I was completely hooked on afternoon frozen yogurt and going almost daily. The winter weather helped break me of that addiction and now I'm back on what others would consider a \""normal\"" schedule. \n\nI love that the flavors change every day and you can print a calendar from their website showing the schedule of flavors. There are about eight different flavors in any given day, and one of them is a \""No Sugar Added\"" flavor. \n\nThe OCD side of me really shines when a new month starts. I print the calendar, take out my highlighter, highlight all of my favorite flavors and those of my fro-yo addicted coworkers, and hang the calendar outside my cube wall. That way it is much easier for us to tell when we need to work time into our schedule to hit the yogurt shop. \n\nThe flavors that are typically highlighted are: \n- Chocolate Covered Banana & Marshmallow (served on the same day, really good as a swirl) \n- Pistachio (really good with almonds as a topping, I tried getting pistachios as a topping and it was a little much) \n- Butterscotch (reminds me of pudding cups back in the day) \n- German Chocolate & Caramel Custard (also served on the same day and very good as a swirl) \n- Irish Cream & Kahlua (not served on the same day, but the closest thing to drinking at work) \n- S'mores (delicious with a graham cracker topping) \n- And every once in a while I like the Reese's with (you know it) Reese's as a topping!! \n\nSee, with so many delicious flavors, it was hard NOT to go everyday. They have plenty of other flavors as well. The only one that I tried that I was not a fan of was the Root Beer Float. The flavor was there, but it wasn't the same without the soda! \n\nEither way, stop by in the afternoon for a sweet treat, and maybe I'll see you there! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For anyone who says that Phoenix has no culture and is just a desert wasteland... please take them to this amazing restaurant.  This place is owned by the same folks who owned Richardson's (which burned down a few years ago- I was devastated - but is being re-built next to Rokerij).  \n\nThis place is dark, hip, inviting with great music and outstanding service.  The food here incredible... New Mexican cuisine meets Wild West flavors.  So good, you'll be kicking yourself for not going sooner.  Was there yesterday for brunch... carne adovada with scrambled eggs.  Seriously, the pork is the best I have ever had.  But everything on the menu is fantastic - steaks, seafood, tamales.  Yum.  Go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I popped into Grinders yesterday afternoon (a bit after lunch time) for a pick-me-up.  I just love this neighborhood gem.  There's a nice comfy vibe and the staff is welcoming and accomodating.  They patiently fielded my questions about available sugar-free syrup options and happily indulged my request for a combination of syrups for my iced latte.  It was fantastic!\n\nI've recently been informed that they host blues music on the 2nd Saturday evening of each month.  I can't wait to check it out next month. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Everytime I attempt to go in here to get my nails done they are unable to do them. I strongly suggest you make an appointment if you want to get your nails done here, because walk-in appointments seem to be out of the question. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been a loyal customer here for years and even highly recommend this nursery to every gardener I meet in person or talk to online forums. But today they have totally changed that.\n\nI went over there to buy some giant timber bamboo. They had some in 3gallon sizes so I picked up two of them. One was marked $72.95 and one was $58.95. I asked the lady that was at the front about why one is priced more than the other, and she said because one was probably bought from a different vendor even though they were the exact same size! So then I asked if she can sell them both to me for $58.95, and told me that she can't do that. I was shocked! Any other store or nursery would have jumped on the opportunity to create a loyal customer in this situation before I had even asked if they can honor the lower marked price! This is just terrible customer service! \n\nI ended up forking up the money for both anyway since I really needed them for my backyard. But this is definitely the last time I'm ever giving them my business and won't be recommending them again to any people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Cool historic building but the service at lunch today was mediocre at best and stay away from the Chicken Parmigiana unless you like fishy tasting chicken.  The best part of my experience was the bread and butter.  :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  TSA at Phoenix Airport (actually at most airports)\n\nLeaving Phoenix is hard enough, but when the lines to check your baggage seem endless and confusing - you just want to turn around and go back to the resort. \n\nFrom what I saw of this airport, it's typical - nothing really to write home about. Basic food and drinks - basic gifts and such, but then - you hit this incredible line. This time it was on the Southwest side!\n\nLuckily there was someone who knew the routine and guided me to the correct long line. Once to the kiosk, a quick scan of my boarding pass had things moving right along. However, the movement was slow once my bags were tagged, because they couldn't put them on the belt - I needed to take them to a holding area - 6 bags checked - 2 arrived in Buffalo.\n\nI have been told it was TSA's security conveyor belts that caused the problem - instead of 4 running they were down to 1. I'm not sure who's issue it was, but it became mine as soon as my bags on a nonstop flight didn't arrive at my destination with me.\n\nTSA stands for Transportation Security Administration, but I like to refer to it as Terrible Service A-holes! I'm not sure how one is selected to work for the TSA, but I don't think it takes much - at least not for some of the positions. \n\nDepending on what gate you are departing from - here are some tips:\n1) Starbucks is right after security - get it there\n2) Food - eat before you pass security as selections are slim after that\n3) Don't check your bags if you want them at your final destination with you\n4) Don't expect much from TSA\n5) Don't argue with anyone in the airport\n6) Drive whenever possible\n\nI really believe that the best picture for this airport would be a lot of TSA folks standing around doing nothing with huge lines behind them! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very disappointing experience. \n\nLooking for a place for my dad. Went in on a Saturday and they were closing early (10 minutes after we arrived) so they were in a rush. J. at the front desk gave us an application and insisted that they needed a money order to hold the apartment for my dad, felt like she couldn't get us out of there fast enough. \n\nReturned on Monday morning and gave the completed application and money order to O., who apparently is the manager, not that identified herself as such while we were there. She actually did not tell us much of anything, except at the very end, she told us it was Affordable Housing. I have no idea what that means, and it isn't posted anywhere in their office or stated anywhere on the application paperwork. I literally have no context for what the means in that moment or that he needed to qualify for his apartment.\n\nLater in the week I called to find out when we could get into the apartment and waited on hold for almost 10 minutes (not like \""oh it was a long hold\"", like it was literally 9 minutes and change that I sat on hold). Apparently my dad had made some errors on the application and they gave his apartment away - no one called us, no one notified my dad that he'd have no place to move into 3 short days later and there are no other apartments for him in the complex. That was it, they just gave it away and didn't bother to tell us until I called.\n\nI emailed them 2 days after that asking them to mail my money order back. Today I sat on hold for 11 minutes to find out it still hasn't been mailed. \n\nAbove is all fact, now for my opinion: The people who work here are miserable, careless and disconnected, going through their job duties like apathetic robots, and I feel dismayed that our tax dollars subsidize this place. Don't bother with this place, get a roommate, look for other Affordable Housing options, whatever you need to do. This place has bad energy, not worth it, no matter how cheap it is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was seeing a show at the Dodge Theater, was short on time, and hungry! I wasn't sure what restaurants were around the Dodge, so my friend and I walked down Washington, confident that we'd stumble upon something at some point. And we did, it was Tom's Restaurant and Tavern. They seemed to have a pretty decent beer selection, and open tables, which we were happy to find so close to the show. \n\nWe sat down and took a look at the menu. It was a special event menu, which I really hate. I don't see the point of restricting the menu so much just because of a show down the street. There were about 4 vegetarian options, few of which seemed appetizing. My friend opted for the potato skins sans chili and I opted for the jalapeno hummus. The waiter returned some time later to let me know that they were out of the hummus, and gave me a different menu that had the aldo pasta listed. penne pasta, marinara sauce, parmesan cheese and garlic bread- i was sold. The food arrived, and wasn't bad. The pasta was pretty small, but was enough to fill me up, and my friend seemed ok with her potato skins. \n\nOverall, the food was ok, but it was really the service that caused me to rate them with only two stars. I'm not sure if our server is a server by trade- it seemed like it might have been his first night. He was super slow and had a really hard time remembering what we had ordered. He also seemed to have to have a hard time with keeping our orders straight and not confusing them with the orders of the tables next to us. I was also really disappointed by the menu. I know that this is more of an old-fashioned diner, but the options were so limited that it was actual work finding something to eat (I'm sorry, but when I was hoping for some cheese or some spicy flavor, a plate of steamed veggies just doesn't sound appetizing). \n\nI'd be willing to give this place another shot, but definitely not on an \""event\"" night, because it was really pretty lame. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Here are some guys who really know their business. Honest and reliable.  My Lexus dealer could not fix the problem - my car still pulled to the right after they did an alignment.  Jacks merely rotated the front tires and the problem was solved.  Why couldn't Lexus do that?  When I asked how much - no charge.  Now you know who the real expert is.  Will need brakes soon and I will go to Jacks for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Absolutely fun place to hang out. Good beer. Good food...except avoid the coleslaw. They had live music when we were there. I've never been to England or Europe but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Fun people fun atmosphere fun times. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I found Deli Roma too late.  Fortunately, I was able to enjoy the godfather part I several times this winter before it closed.  This was my favorite sandwich, anywhere, ever, period.  Sad to see you go, thank you for the delicious food! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have always held this place in high regard, super cute and has always been delicious but when my bf and I and a couple friends went a couple weeks ago I was extremely disappointed. I'm vegan and so is my bf so we were already limited in choices, the Napoli antipasto is awesome but our entree left much to be desired. I forget the exact name but it was basically a spaghetti w pomodoro sauce. I can't believe they charge $16 for this dish! It was cold and not a good portion. I got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip. I love spicy stuff too! Just not a good value for the $. I just moved back from nyc and my fav place there charges significantly less for significantly more. I'm so disappointed bc this was one of my go to places in Pgh! :/ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is one of those places you want to give negative stars to--that's really all you need to glean from this review. \n\nAre you a lady who hasn't had her fill of being talked down to or hit on by sleazy dudes today? Do you need an oil change but really can't be bothered to find out how much it will cost? Do you like overpaying for a carwash whose end result you could have paid $3 at Clean Freak to achieve? Well, sounds like you want to go to visit the total clowns at Danny's. \n\nI went here once about a year ago for an oil change and car wash. It took over an hour and I was really annoyed by the clumsy, gross flirting from the guy and that he forgot to give me the free car wash that came with it and how long it took them to give it to me when I pointed out that I was owed one. Don't make my mistake and go back because they happened to by close to your work and open when all other options were closed and you really need an oil change. \n\nFirst, I pulled up and waited five minutes for someone to make eye contact so I can figure out what bay to pull up to for an oil change. Seriously, if I'm not supposed to pull up to where the signs say OIL CHANGE to get one then get a sign to tell me where else to go to arrange this. Finally, I'm approached by some guy who stared at my cleavage the whole time he gave me the runaround of what costs what. Oh, you want me to pay $10 so that you CHECK--not act upon--the fluid levels in my car and check the tire pressure? Is this ridiculous upcharge only for ladies who you assume to be total dummies or are you an equal opportunity rip-off artist? \n\nAfter about five minutes of conversation, I still have no idea what an oil change costs there, only what extra fees they'd like to charge me for stuff that should be free and I'm pretty sure the employee doesn't either because he wants to be paid under the table. He told me he'd do a full service oil change if I just left $20 in the car. Like, don't exchange money with him out in the open, but leave it in the car, like he's an oil change hooker and I'm the john. I'm assuming your employer isn't keen on you not paying taxes, dude, but thanks for the offer?\n\nI never followed up with these guys to figure out why the employee would tell me that it's $31.95 if I pay inside and $20 if I pay him by just leaving money in the car because I'd rather just stay away from these guys. I got in the car and closed the door on the employee while he was still trying to give me the hard sell because he wouldn't take no for an answer, which is every woman's dream, isn't it?\n\nOh, and the car wash I got last year with the oil change sucked, too. There's nothing to make a girl feel more self conscious about her reliable yet boring Toyota like watching her car get ignored and left with water spots drying on it while all the guys working gather around to take pictures of themselves cleaning a Lamborghini. <|endoftext|>

My fianc\u00e9 and I were thrilled at the outcome as was my future mom! Thank you Burlands! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Even with $30 Groupon for $15 its still overpriced....... \n\nFood is what you would expect from most fast food Chinese food places, however this is supposed to be a \""nice\"" upscale restaurant. Prices are high around $15 and up. OK so the shrimp are a little larger than the $5 lunch restaurants, big deal, still had softer texture than it should have. \n\nOn to service, and yes staff is everywhere, 3 different people came to take our order, one after the other.  It was kind of annoying because no one knew someone just came by 15 seconds before. Food came out real fast, again what I would expect from fast food restaurant. Obvious  success is based on turning tables, and getting me and family out the door.  All 3 dinners were all received at different times about one every 2 minutes, didn't seem right.   ....And then we never saw another server again......   No one  stopped by to ask is there anything else we can get you, ran out of beer, no chopsticks........\n\nBottom line is there is 2 very good restaurants you have to pass to get here, don't pass them.\n\nWILL NOT RETURN OR RECOMMEND <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you like your service poor and your food with hair cooked in it, you've found the right place. Nummy!\n\nI let the hair thing go ONCE. After all it's not as bad as MY cooking, but the second time it happened I let them know they had permanently lost my business. \n\nTheir food is below greasy spoon quality as they do things to meat (at least I THINK it's meat) that are unholy. Like cooking their hair in your food and using salt by the pound on any dish. \n\nI used to love Kyoto bowl back in the nineties, but  I can see why so many of them are closing now. Bad food, bad service. Steer clear. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  From the burned up bagels to the Stepford Wives, glazed over look of the staff, I will no longer be degrading myself by going to Jackson's Java. Today was the last straw. After paying for my muffin (with nobody else in line mind you) the staff began to chit chat, all the while I just stood there with my hands folded and no muffin. By the time someone uttered \""What's he waiting on\"" I had already began my exit. Fair food, fair coffee, horrible customer service, I would recommend seeking out the nearest Starbucks and avoid Jackson's Java like the plague. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Arthur's menu offers a wide variety of options, including burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, & grinders...plus wine desserts & other treats.\nA great spot found in Southpark Mall, to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a beautiful building! It was slightly confusing going here at first because there are two buildings and I was not sure which building my event was held in. Inside there are places to eat and there was plenty of room for the auto show. \n\nFor the purpose that it served I think it was great. I kind of doubt that my review will have any kind of negative or positive effect on whether people go here since we all mostly care about the event that is going to take place more than the venue. \n\nI recommend going here if there is an event you're interested in because it is clean, new, and has close parking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  omg. sitting in the bar because they had no seating in main diningroom.  menus flung onto the table, no greeting from server. when i mentioned it to the server. she gets an attitude. food comes out, cold and unappetizing.... having to listen to a guy at the next table scream, use the f bomb every other sentence.\nmanager did bring our hot food out personally so we got to talk. this is not the place i remember to come and dine and enjoy........ <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Darkest bar in Charlotte! No need to clean up the place just keep the light down extremely low and no one will see the bar scum on the floors. II don't think its that dirty but seriously I don't really know for sure because they keep that place like a damn cave, even in the middle of the day! This Irish Pub is pretty cool though, two bars on two floors and an outdoor seating area partially covered so your covered for the summer time thunderstorms  on sunday funday. Corn hole is set up out on the patio which can help pick up your a portion of your tab if your competitive and into gambling. The bartenders were friendly and the mood is more laid back and chill than other bars downtown. Peak hours can get pretty packed but the off hours are good for kicking it and catching up with some old friends. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I absolutely LOVE noodle soups.  From cold winter nights to a late night snack in the summer, a big bowl of pho always hits the spot (as does ramen or beef noodle soup, but that'll be for other reviews).\n\nPho Minh serves up pho with debatably the most fragrant beef broth in Pittsburgh.  Their pho also always comes with sliced rare beef, which is sometimes cooked well done at other pho places (COUGH TRAM's KITCHEN COUGH).  Also, they do some of the \""unique\"" parts such as tripe, which I am a fan of.\n\nService is reasonably fast, the atmosphere is reasonably dingy in a comforting homey way, and the food is tasty.  Yes, if I want some fresh spring rolls (Gi cun), I'll probably head to Tram's, but when I want pho, I want no nonsense pho, and Pho Minh is the place to be.\n\nOn a sidenote; their other dishes are pretty good too, but for me I'm heading to Pho Minh for their pho. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Is it me or have the prices at Garden Ridge gotten ridiculously high? I admit that I'm more of a seasonal Garden Ridge shopper - Christmas season, but thought I'd go have a look around today...really? Small pressed wood end tables for $149 - $400 for an 8x10' rug? As I looked around more, I realized that most, if not all, of what I'd want could be purchased cheaper at Wal-Mart or Target...and better quality. No wonder the store was empty. There was a sign out front saying that they're planning on revamping the store....I hope that means they'll be sharpening their pencils and cutting those prices or the next sign we'll see out front is For Lease! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  soooo disappointing!  i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes.  also, having lived for some time in NYC, i am familiar with and a fan of Bastianich restaurants.  one of the best meals i've ever had in my life (there aren't many) was at Del Posto.  the Bastianich name to me stands for integrity and love / appreciation / sharing of high quality italian food.  then, i ate here.  are these the same people running this restaurant?!  it was completely mediocre and subpar, as if no one cared about the quality or experience.\n\ni came here for brunch and did the pasta trio and antipasti table.  it was clear the ingredients were not quality and the dishes were mass produced without much flavor or thought.  it was only $25 a person, but can you make an effort?  don't you care about your reputation and good name?  guess not.\n\nthis restaurant seems to be a sellout - a place to make money off the name in a place where the food standard frankly isn't that demanding or high (like in NYC).  also, the service was not that good.  too bad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> D's is a fantastic place with food! Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere! Can get crowded but that's because it's soooo good! I love the selection of beer, it always me to try out a new beer without having to buy a whole case! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about.\n\nStill sad about the whole thing! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The receptionist was ver unwelcoming even on the phone. Very rude. This is my first review, I have never been so annoyed . I wanted to ask a few things before I come for dinner, but the guy just hung up on me. Thanks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and taste of the food.  I had an amazing waiter and the manager was even walking around asking how everyone's meals came out.  \n\nI loved the chips and salsa.  There was a mix of different colored chips with different seasonings.  I ordered steak fajitas which came out hot, tender and delicious.  A lot of veggies and a lot of nice spices.  I ordered a slide of dulche De Leche, which was so good.  \n\nMy bill, with a 30% tip only came out to $20, which I thought was very reasonable.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a nice little plaza area with a cool looking courtyard, surrounded by an office building and a sweet looking Cathedral, a few blocks from Chace field.  I was glad I went here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!\nWhen you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The\""office\"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes?? (Or are they?!? Hmmmm)\nLike I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet?? What a joke!! \nWhen we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever??)\nWe told the lady working the \""front desk\"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, \"" yeah, we get that a lot!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to a late lunch here today.  Great food and great carhops!  A reasonable value and quick service.  Unfortunately, it all comes with a large helping of rudeness from the person taking the orders.  You never see the person who takes your order which is a major weakness in their system.   Today that anonymity was taken advantage of by someone who decided to be abrasive and condenscending  So if you are really hungry and want a side order of crappy attitude and abuse with your lunch, this is the place for you. Personally, I'm going to give it some time because no business can succeed with an employee acting like this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well I suppose I am kinda biased as I teach at YP. But it wasn't always that way. I used to practice at other studios around town and had always enjoyed classes. I metEric, the owner, through a business meeting and we got talking. He invited me to practice and I haven't looked back. Since then I completed the 500 hour certification program and the studio is part of my life. \n\nIf you are looking for something different, go to Pura. The classes still give you the physical work out but what's different is that you get the philosophy too. Not just a few new age words sprinkled in here and there but a truly holistic understanding of this ancient practice.\n\nTry it once. You never know. You might like it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Beautiful view is all they got going for them. We took our family from New York here. The view was fabulous and the story ends pretty much there if you want to hear good reviews. The food was horrible!!! We all got something different so four people can't be wrong. The server was the worst I have ever seen. Ok so if you know you are busy why don't you update your guests instead of ignoring them knowing that you are busy and won't be able to get to them as much as you would like. Our food took two hours to get to us. I was told it was because of the huge party upstairs. Hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in 45 minutes after us. And got their food 30 mintues before us. Yes that's because their server didn't suck and forget to ring in the food. Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen. The table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server. Get it together!! Your food sucks and so does your service. Well our server any way. Go for bar and views nothing else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm changing my mind. I can do that. I can be conflicted. \n\nI don't know if I like this Border's anymore. I mean, its right around the corner, and its great if I need to pick something up for school or just some pleasure reading. But in the end, the employees, (except for my friend Siavonh), suck. Seriously. I've worked retail positions. I know how hard it can be to muster some enthusiasm around 4 o'clock. But its possible, so get real. Don't answer your phones with a crappy attitude, and DON'T take 15 minutes to process a return when there isn't even anyone in line. \n\nPS - I resent the fact that everyone who goes to the coffee shop here decides to move in. Don't you people have internet at home?! The coffee isn't even top tier. Why are you sitting here like shmucks? I just wanted a place to study when the library was closed, and naturally, there was nowhere to sit. Sucky. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I agree with Jake...Mediocre at best....\n\nBoring layout and unkempt when busy....Busy frequently!\nFinding a seating area off the main path is a plus!  The main path feels and looks like an over sized hallway...Beware!  I have been to other CPK's and this one is layed out poorly compared to others I've been to (San Luis Obispo in California, San Francisco in the Business District, and one in Scottsdale close to Bell and Scottsdale Blvd.---Very nice!)\n\nAt this particular location, service was a disaster this past Wednesday evening after work 02-13-08.  ----The two dishes ordered were: Tomato Basil Spaghettini with goat's cheese, and the second dish was Fettuccine with Garlic Cream Sauce with Chicken.\n\nBoth dishes came out at the same time---The Tomato Basil Spaghettini was warmish, at best...The Garlic with Cream Sauce with Chicken had no Chicken! ---(had to be returned to the kitchen) .  I asked the waiter to please return mine to a hot oven or lamp so that I could begin at the same time as my guest...  All this time the waiter acted as if he were doing us a favor, as if we were disturbing him from sorting his receipts from his other poorly served customers!\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, my dish was even colder, just mildly warm!#!$#!  \n\nI recommend that if you are out to impress a guest in any capacity, this is not that place to take them...Go next door to the Cheesecake Factory!  I'm not sure about the service, but the whole layout at least,  looks inviting and clean. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wasn't particularly thrilled with my experience here. Went yesterday, in a rush to pick up a small bear as a gift for a friend's young daughter who was down the road at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. I expected it to be a little busy. It wasn't particularly busy, maybe about ten people all up. Fortunately, I found what I wanted quickly. First problem, there were apparently two \""locations\"" in the store for checkouts, and one of them was very cramped up against the merchandise (enough for no more than two people to stand one behind the other). Not particularly good feng shui. I went to the other, which only had a couple of people in line. A lady looked at me curiously from behind the counter (I hadn't even reached the front, the person in front of me was still being served by someone else) and then took my stuffed bear. She looked at the tag, futzed around for about ten seconds, then leaned back and handed it to me and said \""I'm just going to give this back to you...\"" Then she walked to the far rear area behind the counter and proceeded to ignore me. Talked to someone. Got a sheaf of papers. Walked around. Put down papers. Talked to someone else. I stood there, still in line, and watched her walk around. Then when she asked someone else in the store area if they needed help I realised that she had dropped me. I stopped her and asked her if there was anything that she needed from me and she just told me to wait in line and someone else would attend to me. Fair enough. Then another person leaned out and took my bear (again, bear in mind that I was still \""waiting\"" for the others in front to be done) and laid it on the counter \""ready\"" to be checked out. I waited. Then one person consulted with the other, both with relatively confused looks. I had no idea what was going on. It seemed like none of them had ever worked there before! One person actually offered to take off the tag (with price along with other instructions) then talked to the other to ask if they needed the tag. Turns out that their credit card system was down - figures - and I was asked to sign a printout despite choosing to pay as debit. They then advised me to check and call if there were any problems, which I took to mean that I could be doublecharged or something. Finally, at least twenty-five minutes later I was out of there. I haven't seen that much confusion since bingo night in the stroke ward. Won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish it were possible to give a business 0 stars because this auto repair facility committed several cardinal sins today and are not trustworthy. \n\n(Background: I am a young female who has had plenty of trouble with being treated unfairly in the auto repair world. It is my pet peeve. It is wrong. And you - mechanics - should feel ashamed for taking advantage of women car owners because you think you can.)\n\nI went to Treadquarters today for help after I noticed a screw had punctured my tire earlier this morning. The tire wasn't deflated yet and the screw was deeply embedded in the tread. I needed a patch so I could go on about my day. When I looked Treadquarters up online they were advertising \""Free Tire Repair\"" with some exclusions, none of which applied to me. This coupon, paired with their good reviews, made it an easy decision to stop by. \n\nThe young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon. I'm assuming this company offers such incentives so that customers will bring them other business that creates better revenue. A smart strategy. However, it doesn't work if your employees are begrudging and dishonest. He went out to my car to look at the damage and proceeded to feed me some bullsh*t about the screw being too close to the side wall. The screw was definitively NOT in the side wall or anywhere near it, no matter how many times he tried to show me with his \""thumb measurement\"". It was only about an inch away from the mid-line of tire. Regardless, this young man said it couldn't be patched and that I needed to buy a new tire. I didn't argue because I knew differently since my dad works on cars and I had already sent him a picture of the situation. I thanked the jerk for his time and drove off. \n\nA few miles down the road, I stopped at Woodies. I told the front desk guy there about my situation and he said they would take a look. My tire was patched and I was back on the road in 30 minutes. I will be doing a separate review for the great service I received at Woodies. \n\nThis type of treatment is inexcusable and I have no qualms with denouncing the entire company until they deal with their dishonest employees. He tried to \""screw\"" me over. Bad move buddy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Baoding is great.  The service is outstanding, the food is fresh tasting.  The vegetables are always nice and the proteins are well cooked.   Don't come here if you want greasy, nasty cheap Chinese food.   Go to the food court at the mall and spend $7 for some crap instead.   If you want much nicer quality food in a nice atmosphere with excellent service, come here.  Yes, you will pay more, but it's worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Was there for dinner there tonight 6/5/14. I was staying just a few blocks away and needed quick dinner so went to Cooperstown.  Had burgers there in the past and was very happy.  The Following is a quote from their menu, word for word:\n\n\""\""Rusty Wallace\"" St Louis Ribs.  St. Louis cut pork ribs smothered in dry rub and slow smoked to perfection, then lightly sauced with Cattlemen's BBQ sauce, and flashed on the flame broiler.\""\n\nI was hungry and came in about 20 minutes before close and was waited on by Matt.  I ordered ice tea and asked Matt if the ribs had been cooked recent or a long time ago and reheated.  And told him that if it was the latter that I wouldn't be having them.  He said he would ask the chef, came back and proceeded to say \""the bartender had them and said they were good\"".  Hmmmm, that wasn't what I asked, but noted his answer in my mind and proceeded to order......Yes the ribs with two sides.\n\nThe food comes and it was exactly what I was afraid of, Ribs that had been boiled, then cooked in a oven and braised in marginal bbq sauce.  I ate them and it filled my stomach.  When he came by with the check, he asked \""so how were the ribs\"".  I made him go get a menu and read the above quote. And then nicely without being a jerk told him that the establishment was falsely advertising the ribs.  I explained that I have smoked all meats in a wood fired barrel smoker for over 20 years and I would welcome the opportunity to go in the back and see where the ribs were slow smoked, if what I was saying was wrong.  I also explained that I had been out of tea for 10 minutes and I was a big boy and could handle the truth of how old the ribs were.  He then said that he didn't know how old they were.  Then without apologizing, asked how I was going to pay?  Really?????\n\nThe check was $20.45, and Matt got NO tip.  I had breakfast yesterday at a very popular, very busy establishment...No Relation....Matts BB, Great service and added a $5 tip to a $13 bill...no I'm not a cheapskate.\n\nI would welcome a management response to the ribs and the service!!!!!!\n\nSean Gast <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The perfect inexpensive diner experience - even though it's a small place, we have been there several times and have never had to wait to sit (including a weekend morning). Don't get me wrong, there's always people there, just always seems to be a table ready!\n\nWe are not big eaters so we get a half order of French toast, breakfast special, and a side of grits - and split that all between us and our 1 year old daughter. French toast is unique and excellent, and the breakfast special is exactly what it is supposed to be - eggs, sausage (or bacon), toast, American potatoes, and coffee, and prepared how you like it.\n\nEverything including a milk for the daughter is $20 with tip.\n\n\n\nService is awesome - everyone is super-friendly.\n\n1/2 star reserved for the inconvenience of not accepting credit/debit cards - that would make this place 5 stars! For now, make sure you keep an Andrew Jackson on ya! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Oh, how I dislike this store.  What does a girl have to do to get someone to find her a macbook battery?  Seriously.  How many people do I have to ask.  And, then, finally someone goes to look, only to come back saying that they don't have any.  The mac store has no macbook batteries? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I never thought I would be the kind of person to work out in a gym.  I grew up thinking gyms are only where the meat heads go- the grinds of working on weights just seemed boring and pointless to me.\n\nWhen I turned 30, someone gave me a lifetime membership to Bally's as a gift so I started going because, well, it was a gift and already paid for.  I started seeing some really hot bodies on women in their forties and I started to change my mind.  \n\nBut I was not faithful to Bally's because I just didn't like the atmosphere of the place.\n\nOnce I started to appreciate the value of a work out, I started gym shopping.  Tried LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, Lifetime Fitness and none of them kept my attention or loyalty.\n\nFinally, I ventured into the Village Racquet & Health Club- mainly, again, because friends would have me either workout or play tennis with them at the Camelback Village.  This is where I've fallen in love.\n\nI love the facility, the classes, the equipment, and I don't know who I love more- the people who work there or the members.\n\nThere's some kind of magic to the Village clubs- aptly named the Village because somehow, the place, the staff, the members becomes . . . your friends!  The Village clubs truly is a lifestyle, not a place where you go to sweat off a few pounds then leave for someplace better.\n\nI've worked out in all three locations at one time or another.  Each location I've discovered has its own flavor- Camelback for tennis, classes held early in the morning and in the evening for the working professional, the BAR- Gainey for the triathletes, classes held early in the morning and in the evening, again for the working professional- and DC Ranch for families with a great pool area and classes scheduled more for the stay at home moms.\n\nI love them all- I love going into the beautiful facility, getting greeted by a warm smile from the staff, seeing gorgeous people who are committed to living a healthy lifestyle.  I love how clean the locker rooms always are and there are towels and water just where you need them.  I love the abundance of classes- spin, yoga, pilates and the ever addicting zumba.  I love them all.\n\nVillage- I stay loyal and true to you! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So Mardi Gras was usually a must stop whenever I went out on a Friday or Saturday night in Shadyside during college. This bar is more of an older crowd but they do serve drinks the way I usually make mine. If you order a jack and coke, you'll be lucky if you can even taste the coke. They pretty much give you a glass of jack and a splash of coke. We used to get very very drunk here. The place is really small so you're lucky to see an open table, grab it. \n\nThe bartenders are older and they don't take credit card so bring cash. The drinks are also a little more expensive for Pittsburgh. However, this is the only place in the area that has Delirium Tremens on tap.\n\nThey don't serve food here either so plan on getting messed up if you don't eat anything before you go. The bar is very dark but a lot of my friends love this place and whenever alumni came back, we would definitely go here and make them pay for our drinks. All in all, a very good place to pregame or just to hang out and socialize. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night screaming, \""I NEED TO GO TO PADDY CAKE BAKERY\"". Okay, that may be a lie, but if you've been here you'd know why I'm saying this.\n\nAs much as I love the newfangled bakeries such as Vanilla and the now defunked Dozen, to me, there is nothing like a good old fashioned take a number type of bakery. Paddy Cake is located on Liberty Avenue near West Penn Hospital. If you blink you'd miss it which leaves more cookies for me.\n\nIt's hard to describe the desserts with any other adjective other than delicious. I hate to sound corny and easy to please but the thumbprints are to die for. Everything I've bought there has been better than I anticipated. Donuts- amazing. Cookies- wonderful. Pastries- Delicious. I think you get the point. I feel like I come with a ten dollar bill, leave with money and have a bag full of goodies. The money will soon be spent on milk to wash these puppies down. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Kind of a dingy version of the Walgreen's chain of drug stores.  I'm not sure how long it's been there but it seems like it has not aged well no matter how long it's been.\n\nGetting to the place is a challenge in this strip mall at the corner of Harris and Tryon but at least once you're there, the parking lot situation is not too bad given the decent number of reserved for Walgreen's spaces that exist.\n\nFinally, being open 24/7 is a plus at least. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!! First off ordered a margarita came to the table looking very weak and it tasted even worse I had to send it back! I decided to just go with a draft beer which is very hard to screw up. They give you free chips with salsa the salsa was nothing special either no kick, then came the enchiladas I ordered one word Terrible too much cheese on top, shredded chicken with no flavor inside and not one decimal of spice! The service was slow and prices were way too high for this place! The only thing positive I have to say is the cervaza was cold <|endoftext|>

I travel 150 nights/year for work so I order food a lot.  These were the worst wings I've ever had  I called the manager and she freely admitted \""that's our worst food - we get the most complaints on the wings\"" ...

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really would love to give a better rating to a vegan restaurant. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with EVERYTHING. \n1. I waited 40 min for a take out (with only 2 occupied tables at that time)\n2. A guy who ordered after me got a free piece of cake for the long wait. (it wasn't offered to me) \n3. Terrible service \n4. The decor is something you see in senior houses in Sun City\n5. Almost all items on the menu have soy protein.. TVP? Is it really something healthy or it's some sort of cardboard pretending to be food?\n6. They packed my to go order in such a way that the soup turned before I got to my car, soaking thru the paper bag, landing on my pants, and on the sidewalk...  I went inside to tell them that- NO apology, NO money back. \n\nI wonder why they are not closed yet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mediocre Thai food. I had the Pad kee Mao, a dish that was supposed to be wok fried in a chili and garlic sauce, but I tasted no garlic and little chili - it was asi, asi. My lunch companion thoroughly enjoyed his panang curry and was sweating up a storm from the spice.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish.  Oh well, it doesn't matter, with so many delicious options for Thai food in the valley, I probably won't return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  All right, after a couple of years of sending my animals here, I have to say I have been disenchanted with this place.  Let me tell you why:\n\n1. Cost - While I thought this place was expensive before, I really had no realization of HOW expensive this place really is.  It is around $60 for the office visit, any blood work or testing is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced, and even the vaccinations have run much higher than I have ever paid in my life. In one year, I spent more than $2000 in testing, bloodwork, and medication for my dog who was diagnosed with Cushings Disease.  \n\n2. No set vet - Please don't get me wrong, I understand there are times when you have multiple vets an office and sometimes they need to cover for each other or consult each other.  However, you have no set vet there, as far as I know.  Any vet could be handling your animal.  It really stinks when you have gotten attached to a particular vet and you can't always see or talk to that vet.  I worry that this affects the quality of care than my animals get there.\n\n3. Boarding - So, the last time I have ever boarded my dog was here, and the experience was bad enough that I will now never board my animal again.  My dog had been the vet here and been prescribed medication by the vet for his Cushings disease.  I left specific instructions on his medications and included more food than he would ever really need.  All the food was given to him, more than he probably needed, and of course several doses of his medication were not given to him.  He was there for 5 days.  The manager of the kennel was understanding, and he did refund one day of boarding and the medication fees I paid.  Well, considering each day of boarding is $25 (which seems expensive for the care he got) and I had already paid $125, this was better than nothing but still did not make up for this mistake, as my dog spent a miserable and restless time there.\n\n\nI still appreciate that they participate in a lot of community events, and it is handy that you can do so much online there with the pet portal.  They are great at sending you reminders of vaccinations due with plenty of time to get it taken care of.  I am just not sure that I see the value in all of that compared to the high costs of care. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to agree with the others, it's not much but a high priced ice cream stop. The concept was good when it first arrived on the blockmany years ago, but now I wonder why people keep returning. This was my 1st or maybe my 2nd visit to the Creamery, I think I went decades ago to the first one on Mill Ave. \n\nHowever for the $6 I spent on a medium scoop with mix-ins I am not impressed. The coupons given to me I will pass along to some friends' kids who may or may not ever use them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Anyplace named Bubba's is a place needing a visit. Any place that combines Bubba's and Barbeque is a no brainer in the QC. Located in North Charlotte off exit 16 (Sunset Blvd West), this place is simple and tries to be nothing more. This is your typical NC BBQ w/vinegar sauce being the specialty. Hush puppies are so delightful that a basket must accompany any BBQ. The pork is so moist that not much sauce is needed, though I love to get the hands messy with a proper dousing of the vinegar based sauce. Great for a quick eat in or massive take out. Apparently they cater too! \n\nMake sure to check out the men's room (men and women alike) as Bubba, who is there most days, will give you a good laugh at his creation. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The BBQ fried chicken was interesting and good. The breast meat was very juicy. The highlight was the onion rings. This is what onion rings are all about, very thin breading and super crunchy. I'm thinking about going back for some more rings. The lemon cherry sundrop is worth trying as well. $11.20 for 1/2 chicken, slaw, onion rings, and large soda. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK I might be picky. But when a party of four goes to a steakhouse I expect to see steaks on the tables. But these steak prices are nuts for a casual dinner spot, as were the The four plates on the table all together consisted of less than 18 oz of beef. Pretty sad for a steakhouse if you ask me. \n\nBut I will say this for the place. The staff and management was nice except for the one waiter lacking manners and reaching over me and across my plate to hand off condiments to my dining partner. \n\nThe staff is quick to refill your glasses. Friendly and otherwise thoughtful. \nI might not come there for a meal again but I would consider it a decent place for appetizers and drinks. So the Saloon might just become a favorite watering hole for me from time to time. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Museum is located next to the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. Admission is $12 for Adults, $10 for seniors, and $8 for military, kids, and students. The main museum is located in a hanger with a gift shop in an adjacent building. Various aircraft ranging from jets, helicopters, and gliders, both military and civilian, are located inside and outside the hangers. Notable mentions are the US Airways Flight 1549 Airbus that crashed in the Hudson River back in 2009, a DC-3, CH-47 Chinook, an F-4 Cockpit, an Air Force One Replica, as well as several other neat aircraft. Not only do you learn about the aircraft itself, but you learn about the story behind the aircraft. The tour guides are very helpful at answering any question you may have and are very friendly and knowledgeable. The gift shop sells models of aircrafts as well military novelty items. Overall, if you have an interest in aviation, check this place out, there is room for improvement down the road, but I enjoyed my time there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Update... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay.  \n\nThey report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities.\n\nIn response to the manager's comments:  As I noted above, they refunded our stay.  The TV cabling is exposed... perhaps not as dangerous as exposed electrical wire, but not something to be particularly proud of if you consider yourself to be a business built on customer service and the impression of luxury. \n\nThe \""ongoing\"" repairs in the hallways were not touched during our (middle of the week) stay, so one must wonder about the urgency of those repairs.   \n\nThe building we stayed in was not full.  Why did they put my family in the oldest, most dilapidated room? \n\nAs far as moving to a different room, any one who has traveled with children would know how difficult  it is to move from one hotel (or hotel room) to another.  We arrived after a 3+ hour drive at 5pm in the middle of a thunderstorm with a very tired and cranky toddler.  Given the relative level of competence at the front desk at the time of check in, we weren't confident that any room we would be moved to would be any better.\n\nI stand behind my review.  If I could give the place zero stars, I would. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> i have had several pairs of pants hemmed here.  they are fast, friendly, and are always willing to get it done sooner for no extra charge.  i'm sure i could find a place to get my pants hemmed for a cheaper price, but i like seeing friendly faces.  fyi - they charge $8 to hem pants, more for other options like keeping the original hem.  the entrance to the parking lot is difficult and people who park in that lot can't park between the lines for whatever reason. <|endoftext|>

Unfortunately the gyro I got was really soggy, the meat and sauce was everywhere, not fresh, and the bread had a very distinct burnt taste to it. The fries were gross... I don't know what went wrong with this place, but it was packed out with people eating awesome looking salads.... I guess I ordered the wrong thing <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I can't say enough positive about Deer Creek Animal Hospital. I have been going to them with my pets for about 3 years now. I have boarded my dog there several times and she always comes home happy and totally worn out from play time. I understand the need for a flea/tick dip after boarding, but I think the price plus the requirement for a dose of Frontline is a little high. Still, my dog loves it there and it is the only place I'll leave her. \n\nAs far as vet services, they are excellent. I recently had to put my cat down after 15 years together. I came home from work to find him unable to move and I called the vet at 4:45. I was so relieved when they told me to come right in with him. Dr. Robbins assisted us with seeing my old boy safely to the Rainbow Bridge. Her words of comfort and a hug afterward meant the world to me. And then a few days later, I received a sympathy card signed by all the staff with a personal note from Dr. Robbins. I feel like Dr. Robbins and her team always go above and beyond. This is, by far, the best vet's office I've ever known. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Upfront disclosures:\nI am a sushi snob, and am extremely particular about my sushi.\n\nI am going to break my review into two parts - Typical Japanese food and sushi.  \n\nTypical Japanese food: We ordered some pork shumai that were pretty good, but was served with a brown-wasabi-type paste.  It tasted like wasabi, but why the hell was it brown? We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi.  The kimchi was very spicy, but good.  The pork was a bit tough.  \n\nThey have a whole list of special appetizers, but only about 4 were translated into english.  My girlfriend asked for more translation, but the waiter told us we really wouldn't be interested in them, so we dropped the conversation on it. \n\nMy gut tells me this place has very good, and very authentic Japanese food, but I am not experienced enough in non-sushi Japanese food.  \n\nOn to the sushi:  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp.  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place.  \n\nMusashi has a very small sushi menu.  There are few rolls to choose from, and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri.  \n\nWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.  The fish was cut rather sloppily, and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon.  The salmon was all pink, no typical white-fat lines....  why?\n\nThe rolls come in pieces of 3, which I find weird.  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces.  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up, as the rice was cold and solid - not like sushi rolled right in front of you. \n\nWe have not been back.  If you're looking for really, really, really authentic Japanese food, I would head here and try.  if you're looking for a great sushi experience, I would try other places in the area. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I asked a friend of mine if she had a good dermatologist, and she goes to Camelback Derm.  I made an appointment (dealing with mild acne), and was optimistic for some new treatment as well as to get a prescription for a topical I had already been using.  I knew going into it I would be seeing a PA first and then meet the doctor.  I made it clear on both the written forms they have you fill out as a new patient and verbally stated to the PA that I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot take certain medications with antibiotics.  I met the doctor for only 5 minutes.  i was still given a prescription for a topical with an antibiotic in it and when i got home, after doing more research, it was highly suggested on many websites (including the drug company's) to not use this medication because of my autoimmune disorder.  This was the first frustrating issue.  I called the doctors office and left a message with the nurse's line, and they did call back pretty quickly saying they would change the prescription.  While it was nice that the doctor gave me samples and coupons for the prescriptions, one of them was expired, and could not use it at the pharmacy (though I did end up later finding one online through the drug company).  I also found that frustrating-but only because it costed me an extra half an hour of going back and forth to the pharmacy.  Overall, I felt most bothered by the fact that I expressed more than once that I have this pre-existing condition that should be taken into consideration, and the neither the PA nor the doctors seemed to take notice.  I do understand that this doctors office is very large and busy, but being that I was a new patient to the office, I felt very rushed.  But, this office location is very convenient to where I live, and for the most part do not have many other skin problems to deal with, so I don't plan on having to go to this office very often, other than to follow up on my progress with these medications. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. \n\nAnd there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that \""I am not going to make money off of you\"" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.\n\nI was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)\n\nSo go to Guiseppes if you like:\n\n_\""EH\"" Italian Food\n_Cold and dry humor from the owner\n_Slow waitresses\n_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere\n_Your hopes let down =) Enjoy! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been loyal to Pruitt's  for years but after this last ordeal will not shop there any longer.   I purchased a recliner that was a floor model and was wobbly.   I wa promised that it would be fixed before delivery' but it was delivered broken.    Then I scheduled a technician to come out and fix it.   He ended up taking it back to fix it and I cannot get it delivered because I work and cannot be home for delivery on their schedule.   They said if I return it they would charge a 20% restocking fee.   So I still do not have my recliner.\nWorst customer service ever. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After a stressful day of test taking, my friend and I just wanted to relax, eat, and it was a beautiful day so we preferred somewhere outside.  She had been to Esquire before and said the burgers were good.  \n\nI really like the place.  I had the chicken tender sandwich with fries, and it was FABULOUS.  Everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be.  At first it was delivered to the table empty, just a bun and chicken fingers.  But then I was told of the \""Fixin's Table\"" where I got to add my own lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a sauce(s) of my choosing. \n\nI enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by.  And when my other friend showed up with her dogs, they didn't mind at all.  And she loved that they had Fat Tire on tap.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place.  The only problem with sitting outside is that you do not get to throw your peanut shells on the floor- you have to bring a bowl outside for the shells... ah well...  On those cold winter nights I can throw my shells on the floor inside. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. \n\nOK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. \n\nMeanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... \""maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see\"" we said to each other ... \n\nOn our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - \""pigs stomach with jalapeno\"", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?  The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus. \n\nWe'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  2 stars for just the food. In Phoenix, we are currently having an heat warning, so water would have been great. I understand things get busy, 10 minutes is a bit of a long wait with the heat. The waitress came as I was heading to the to get water from the bar. She got our order. I asked for a root beer and a burger with no onions. The root beer came late and the burger came with onions. It may have been the kitchen's fault and the food was still good. The, who I am assuming was the manager, refilled our waters because the waitress was too busy doing whatever in the back. Never got a refill on the root beer, the drink I actually spend money on. Got the bill, but the waitress went M.I.A. for 15 minutes. Finally got up to ask a bus boy where a register was so we could pay. The waitress showed up as we were talking to him. It was disappointing because we heard such great things, but we did not get a decent service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place it's great. Really reminds me of a country feed store. They carry everything you need for any size pet, the staff is very helpful & they have the best prices around. I was paying 10\u00a2 pet cricket at petsmart & they sell there's in bulk 500 for $20. Which is a lifesaver when your son has 2 growing beardies.\nAnd I love how there's always baby chicks & ducklings chirping away. They're so cute!\nP.S. anyone looking for fly/flea spray for pets or livestock- AVON SKIN-SO-SOFT spray oil is the best cheapest non-toxic bug/mosquito repellant out there.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I received a PJ set as a gift from my Mom for Christmas. She paid $19.20 for the top and $19.20 for the pants which = $38.40 total.  Unfortunately, they were too big, so I had to return them for store credit. Upon doing so, I was told that the items were now on sale, and that they would only refund me the sale price, which was $14.39 per piece, plus they were deducting the $10.00 Kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase. So, my Mom paid $38.40 for the PJ's and because they did not fit and I had to return them, I was given $20.05.  \nThe Kohl's cash I almost get, but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull! But the taking the Kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well. It's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out, it's just a big money maker.   I will never shop at Kohl's again, and I will ask my friends to do the same. Especially if for a gift. Not a happy customer. Goodbye Kohl's <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've only eaten here for lunch. I would highly recommend it! It's fast, friendly, priced right & very good. I always order the Pad Thai w/ chicken. They offer a spice (heat) range from 1 to 5 (5 being the hottest). I usually go with a 4. At lunch, for $7.95, you get unsweetened tea, soup, & your entree dish. They offer a different soup every day of the week. There is something to be said about friendly service and this place has it! To walk in and be greeted by name is a nice feeling. Because of my job, I once went almost a year without going in, but my first time back, I was greeted by name with a friendly smile, seated, and they even remembered what I used to order. Wow! It can sometimes be pretty busy at lunch time but the wait is never too long. You've got to give it a try! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been a fan for years, ate here yesterday to get my regular hot dog but the bun was a little different.  It was hard on the edge but it still ended up pretty good everywhere else.  This place has been cleaned up pretty well over the years.  I even noticed the health inspections have finally gotten better.  I would be lying if I didn't tell you that this is my favorite hot dog in town and occasionally crave it.  The area is scary so you may want to exercise your second amendment right when you come here.  Also parking blows since there is always more people that want to go here at lunch than spots to park.  It is a very casual place that you order at the counter and seat yourself.  This place used to be a fried chicken fast food place I think about 20 years ago when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This review is for the Giorgio Armani Beauty counter at Saks Fifth Avenue... specifically, this review is for \""Face Designer,\"" Lindsay.\n\nMy wedding planner suggested I call Lindsay when I told her I needed someone that could do a 'natural' look... \n\nAs some of you know, Jared (my fiance) hates me in makeup, so finding someone that can do makeup that he actually doesn't complain about is challenging.  But guess what?  Lindsay did it!\n\nShe gave me a very natural looking sun-kissed look and I felt beautiful all day and night... and Jared liked it too.  I've already reserved Lindsay for the big day, but I'm sure she'll be my go-to face designer anytime I'm in need...\n\nIf you are looking to get your make-up done, or are in need of a good product, give Lindsay a call... you will not be disappointed! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Delicious. I went for lunch today and got the red curry with tofu, which came with soup and a small eggroll. They used fresh tofu, not deep fried, which was a new twist for me. It was delicious, fresh tofu cut with ridges so as to absorb more flavor from the curry sauce. I ordered it \""hot\"" and that was plenty spicy for lunch! It made me sweat, and I have a fairly high tolerance. In any case, the place was nice, the food superb and service was friendly. I'll be back! <|endoftext|>

He made everything so easy and was very flexible to accommodate our wishes.  David was definitely icing on the cake.\n\nWhile we are from Milwaukee and the wedding will be at Old World Wisconsin it was well worth the drive to Madison.  Skip Milwaukee caterers and go with Blue Plate based on quality, service and price.\n\nI'll update after the wedding. <|endoftext|>

None of the machines seemed to work properly at all. Plus like 80% of the games either ate my coins or did not give me tickets for my kids. I continuously had to call employees to either retrieve my coins or tickets. The games that did give you tickets were cheap as hell. You can't fool me chucky!! BUT THE KIDS!! SHAME ON YOU!! Your lucky to get a 2 out of 5! The best part was the McDonalds across the parking lot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This lovely restaurant near the BOA Headquarters and the business district is a surprisingly excellent restaurant in a hotel at the Marriott. The service was exquisite, friendly and fun. I was alone in the restaurant, and the server treated me incredibly well with conversation, tastings and suggestions. The shrimp and grits was my entree of choice and a house specialty. It was unlike any I've had in NOLA -- not barbqued, but roasted shrimp and scallops in a tomato butter sauce. The grits were so yummy and rich. The scallops were so large and tender that I could barely finish them. This is an excellent choice in downtown for a unique take on southern cuisine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were on hold for OVER 10 minutes and then hung up on us. By the time we got to the place, they hung up on us!! Went in and they said a 50 minute wait AND said that there would be a $1 PER TOPPING charge which is NOT what it said on the online special!! This place is a rip off!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fabulous restaurant. Went with my girlfriends for Sunday brunch and it was fantastic from the moment we walked in. Our waitress was incredibly friendly (and even commented on how pretty I was - MAJOR tip for her obviously). The atmosphere was relaxed with a dim setting and apparently very popular for Sunday brunch (it even has its own menu). If you get to stop by, order the chicken tortilla soup or the egg benedict. DELICIOUS! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the second time that I have been here, and both times were terrible. I typically enjoy the standard \""tex-mex\"" type restaurants, but this was a pretty poor example of the style.\n\nLike most of these places the experience starts with chips and salsa; this salsa was bland and watery. The chips were cold and stale; not sure when they made them, but I'm sure that it was not the day they served them to us... At this point I should have left and drove up the road to Azteca, Don Pedro or any of the other taco shacks the Queen City has to offer; but sometimes I am not so sharp so we proceeded to order lunch.\n\nI ordered the chimichanga; now usually a chimichanga is a flour tortilla filled with a wide range of seasoned flavorful ingredients and deep fried until it is a golden brown color and slightly crispy on the outside. This thing was filled with bland, unflavorful, grayish colored \""shredded beef\"" and was soggy, they then smothered it in some sort of unseasoned canned tomatoes that they tried to pass off as salsa, I assume to mask the lack of flavor in the dish itself. On the side was some wilted lettuce with sour cream and something that vaguely resembled guacamole, and some oily rice that was nearly as flavorless as the rest of the meal. Phenomenal. I managed to eat about a quarter of this flavorless, oily, soggy train wreck before I gave up and threw in the towel. \n\nWhen the server finally came back around several minutes later, she acted like she didn't even notice that none of us had eaten more than half of their meal, and quietly picked up the plates and brought us our checks. None of us were asked how our meal was, if everything was OK, if we wanted any desert or more chips and salsa, and none of us received a refill on our drinks.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the worse restaurant prepared meals that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Kudos to the good folks at El Cancun <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is located in the heart of downtown. Food is average and service is not bad. Will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 PM. But take out is very fast. \n\nI have been going here for past 7 years and one thing that sucks big time is the two Cantonese women who manages this place.  They have no idea what is a good service in a restaurant means. They are rude. Literally rude. Half the time you don't understand what they speak in English. No in this restaurant are polite. They serve food as if they are serving people in homeless place. And they never treat you as patrons by the way. \n\nAm I eating and dining there ? \""No\"".

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Used to be one of our favorites, though the last two times in have disappointed. Recent outing included drinks downstairs and staff was unfriendly and uninterested in helping guests.  Dinner upstairs was a poor experience. Our entrees for our party came out about 10 minutes apart and to make matters worse two entrees were incorrect. One entree was replaced and the second was replaced using the previous plate with a portion of the meal replaced.  Has Rokerij lost it's touch? <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very solid Thai place. I have the fried spring rolls, which was good (crispy flaky crust, but the filling wasn't anything to write about), the vegetarian tom yum soup (pretty good, but honestly I've had better tasting broth), and the winter curry.  The curry was interesting, but the kabocha squash (which i'm a fan of) didn't seem to fit in right with the curry.  The curry itself was good and the dish was a good effort.  My gf had the vegetarian pad thai.  She thought it was good, but a little too soupy (too much fluid).\n\nAlso, they offer most things spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  They said 5 is good, but I tasted almost no spice.  I'd go for a 10 next time.\n\nFrom what I read this places is among the best in Pitt, and I can see how this might be true.  Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll definitely consider coming back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really don't know how this place has such great reviews. I walked in on Friday night to order takeout. I waited at the bar/counter area for about 10 minutes with maybe 5 other people all waiting to order take out or pick up. It seemed very chaotic for the one woman behind the counter taking orders, fetching them, and ringing them out. It looked like she was even serving on the floor at times. The food took about 20-25 minutes once my order was placed. Prices were okay, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. I got Hot & Sour Soup (nice and spicy) and Mongolian Beef (a weird light brown color...).\n\nAs for ambiance, it definitely has that feel of chinese restaurants from the 90's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They make a good brandy old fashioned, but otherwise I am not a fan. Like a previous reviewer, I am also grossed out by tartar sauce that has been sitting out for who-knows-how-long. And the fish fry? I really don't see any greatness there.  Cave-ish interior, average clientele age of 75--really not my scene. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am a real Chinese, so this flavor is all I'm being looking for in Glendale...we ordered several \""signature\"" dishes for schzuan style on the menu, and there are definitely ups and downs here:\n\nThe cold dishes taste really good. We ordered beef tripes, and they're delicious.\n\nWe also tried the kidney, love it! The chicken in hot wok, love it! The steamed whole tilapia, you HAVE TO try it!!! Super delicious!!!\n\nThe water-boiled series are a little bit turned down for me. The taste is weird and there should be way more vegetables in the soup. \n\nIn general, pretty good place to have some schzhuan style food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The perfectly balanced cappuccino -- skim milk, extra shot --warmed the cockles of my heart.\n\n$9.49 for an aromatic pound of Italian Blend espresso beans lovingly roasted on premise had my wallet  -- and then our espresso machine -- singing \""O Sole Mio.\""\n\nNattily dressed coffologists -- sporting plaid button-fronts and page-boy caps -- ignited the same butterflies that drove my obsession with \""Newsies\"" in middle school.\n\nSo many reasons to love this little independent wonder. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They talk big but don't be fooled.  You will get terse emails and they don't give you any feedback after an interview.  You have to stay on top of them for everything.  The only way you will know if you got the job is if they call to tell you you got it because they sure won't call to tell you you didn't.  Good luck trying to reach your recruiter, they are always at lunch or in meetings.  I had to be proactive - which is ok - I'm the one looking for a job after all but I didn't think it was too much to expect professionalism and good service.  What I got is the impression that I was simply a means to reach a monthly quota.  They post jobs that match my skills yet I never receive a phone call and when I reach out to them to inquire about it, I get a vague \""those positions are under review\"".  More like \""these jobs don't really exist, we're just trying to build our pool so we can reach our monthly quota\"". <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Where to start ... First we checked in after trying to park for seemingly forever (we noticed on the way out - that the sign directing you to the parking deck is only posted on the way OUT of the property - not on the way in so when you come in late and it's dark, you'd never see it!  Room was decent - no complaints for the cost.  We went down to the restaurant to get a snack for my daughter and a glass of wine for me... it took FOREVER!    Finally we got our order and were off to bed ... not!\n\nThere was a group in the room next too us who were talking loudly (almost screaming) and it all came through the door...Our mistake was not calling down to complain (which in retrospect we should have but we kept thinking eventually they would go to bed :(  Finally after 3:30 am it died down.\n\nWhen we went to tell the front desk what happened, the girl had this 'deer in the headlights' look and did express regret we had a problem.  I asked if we could receive a discount on our room and she checked with the manager and quickly came back and said no since we didn't call them about the problem :( but they could comp us a breakfast.  I relayed our story from the night and our feelings we didn't want to return (esp when we saw the line at the hostess stand) but took the voucher since it was that or nothing.\n\nThe restaurant was worse for breakfast.  We stood out by the hostess for at least 10 min and couldn't even get the hostess to let us know how long it would be before be seated.  Two other couples and us were all in the same boat. Hostess was totally overwhelmed. Walked back over to the desk and expressed out findings and she asked us to walk back over.  Long / short the line finally disappated quickly and we were finally seated only to find that there was only a buffet ... so the question that begs to be asked - why was there a line to begin with?!   There were tables and servers?  Bad planning and execution?  Why wasn't there a sign indicating that it was buffet or nothing?  \n\nHonestly, if we didn't have the voucher, we wouldn't have stayed after a walk through the buffet area .... The quality was awful... No plates for oatmeal, stale bagels, beyond runny eggs, undercooked sausage and no pancakes or waffles...\n\nOn an ancillary note, the hotel was swarming with middle, high and possibly college teams.  This didn't bother us since we've been on a dozens of these trips with our daughter.  The problem with it was that the management of the hotel seemingly didn't notice that they were totally booked and staff appropriately for the weekend.  \n\nFor $135+ for a room for the both of us - to stay 8:30 pm until 10:00 am - with all the problems we had with the sound control and service...definitely was not worth it.  The night before we were in the Penn State area and stayed at a Super 8 for a 1/3 of the cost and had a great night sleep and decent free breakfast.  \n\nIf we find ourselves back in the area ... would not stay here or recommend it. <|endoftext|>

After 41 years as one of the best and most authentic Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix Don Joes's closed for a short period of time.  But alas, we can all stop the sniveling.  Don Jose's has reopened after a good deal of remodeling.  The best news is everything else is the same.  All of the great, reasonable and made to order food is one waitress from you getting exactly what we loved all those years of weekly dinner at this family owned restaurant.   Don Jose himself will be right there to greet you.  Same food, same great customer service.  What a great way to start the New Year <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After I wrote this, my fiance got sick from the food. \n\nSo, I looked up their health code violations, and they don't store their food at proper temps.\n\nEw. :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went to check out a game with some friends and was horrified at our service.\n\nOne of our party received a cold pizza roll and brought it to our server's attention. \n\nHow tacky can one be in deciding to stick one's finger in a patron's food and declare the patron wrong?\n\nUnbelievable. \n\nAnd then the manager decided to get in on the action. He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.\n\nReally?\n\nIf this is any indication of how customers are treated at Picasso's, rest assured that members of my party took note and WILL spread the word.\n\nMy first and last visit. \n\nThank you for a great football Sunday. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible, horrible service.  I went twice before writing a review.  the first time I thought maybe it was an off day.  The second time, they lost me as a customer.  The wait staff was more interested in talking about their weekend plans than serving customers.  The food was okay, nothing special.  But, for the price, I expect a little more service from a staff that realizes they're not working at Denny's.  Hell, Denny's usually has pretty solid service.  This place will have to go to an extreme to get me to return.  If I could give them zero stars, I would. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  receptionist was very rude and i would never take my pet here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  To me, this airport is way more complicated than it needs to be. Security sucks, they have it set up horribly with everyone shoved in a corner and the people are mean. I'm not a dumb traveller, i follow the rules and have everything opened and placed quickly so that I can go through security as fast as possible. They still, however, insist that I go through the full body scanner (\""the violator\""), and have even criticized my clothing choice (the zippers on the ankles of my skinny jeans should not cause alarm, seriously). \n\nThe way that the terminals are separated, with specific restaurants in different areas, makes it so you have to walk forever through a maze of people, employees etc. It's just ridiculous. The have advertisements of being \""America's friendliest airport\""... but compared to Portland, that's a bad joke. I'd much rather fly to Tucson, at least they have more space and the people are nicer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After hearing about this place for years, and finally being able to get a parking spot close by, I decided to try it. But low and behold the pizzeria was full so I was directed to a very cluttered and crowded market with the same menu. Besides the uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere, it was frustrating finding a spot to wait for my food without being pushed in a corner or up against a display. And sorry, the food was good but those had to be magic avocados for the price I paid for that personal pizza. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been going to Red Devil for years.  Always know what you are going to get here.  Good Pizza, sandwiches, wings and more.  The service is great and the prices are reasonable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Whoops, I thought this location just opened up...but I guess I just never went down McDowell for anything. \n\nAnyway, I fall into the category of people who think the food induces yawning. I had the Greek Pita and there was nothing Greek about it. My chicken, though, was NOT dry at all...quite tasty by itself in fact. See, its not that the food here doesn't taste good, its just that its nothing special...a sandwich packed in your lunchbox is just as good as what I had here. This wrap tasted like the thousands of others I've had. (that's right, thousands) \n\nI didn't read reviews before I went, and I did it on purpose. Its right down the street, they serve sandwiches, so I had decided that this is a place that I will find something to like about. Another place to add to my wall-of-menus. But...I will visit 2 more times for a total of 3. 3 strikes and you're out is fair, right? \n\nOn the plus side, even though the food was boring, it was still fresh. And if you scratch the dressing, it'll be healthy. But likewise if you scratch the dressing....you might fall asleep while eating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Dear AJ's,\n\nWhen I worked at the Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs down the street from you, you were the only thing I had to look forward to in the day.  There were a gazillion restaurants I could have eaten at on site, but they all sucked shit and treated other employees like crap for some reason.  You were my half hour reprieve from that god forsaken place, where I could escape the whiny assholes who'd come up to the front desk and my puffy-cheeked manager who'd roll his eyes if I wanted to smoke a cigarette.  Remember when I would come in twice almost every single day, once for breakfast, once for lunch and then you'd see me drive by at the end of the day and I'd wave and almost get into a car accident because I wasn't paying attention to the road?  Ahhhhhhh...\n\nYou're the only store in the valley that I know of that sells Cock and Bull ginger beer, quite possibly the best there is in the world, even better than the really good Jamaican stuff. [ *if anyone knows of better ginger beer, cough it up because I am in love with it* ]  Your other selections of gourmet sodas were all excellent choices too.  I really like your sandwiches, man; they hit the spot just right.  \n\nI wish I'd met you under better circumstances.  If I hadn't hated my job, you would have seen me smiling through the aisles.  As it was, you probably saw me eyeballing one of your many fine wines, contemplating if I should get drunk and tell my boss to go fuck himself.  Don't worry, I didn't.  I did quit though and immediately celebrated by eating a sandwich outside of you.\n\nI miss you a lot.  I don't really drive my car very much anymore, and if I did drive, no offense, that's pretty much the last part of town I'd like to be in, aside from obvious ghettos.  Perhaps I could move you, brick by brick to a new location that is closer to me?  No?  That's fine.  If you're not comfortable, I won't press it any further.  \n\nWith that, I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  I'm still a member of your sandwich club and have the card in my wallet.  It will be used again, old friend. \n\n-Billy <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My local sports bar.  It has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.  \nIt is a bar.  It has bar food.  Nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries, sandwhiches and wings.  On the other hand, I've never had a bad experience either.  So when I eat there, I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular, but I am expecting constantcy.  Consistancy is what is delivered.  \nBuffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.  \nService is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there.  The plus is, when specific staff is working, the  place is that much of a better establishment.  Consistantly just above average in my opinion.\nI chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. \n\nWe scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.\n\nBe warned that everything here comes with french fries, even the salads. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the BEST PIZZA I've had here in Phoenix, seriously out of this world.  The neopolitan/new york style is amazing, the cheese is nice and gooey, the crust is nice and chewy, and the bottom of the pizza is slightly crunchy.  The sauce they use is perfect, sweet but just enough. I seriously cannot say enough about how great this place is.  \n\nWhen my boyfriend called to place an order for pickup he took too long and got hung up on, with a curt \""We're busy, your pizza will be ready in 20\"" in true New York style.  Love it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been trying to find new and different restaurants recently, and this is one I found:\n\nAbout the place:\n- It's small\n- It's packed and crowded.\n- Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward and can't be comfortable.\n- I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.\n- There is free parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space\n\nThe food:\n- NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.\n- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries.\n- The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.\n- You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest.\n- The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.\n\nThe staff:\n- They are overworked but they are nice.\n- One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.\n\nSuggestions for D's:\n- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!\n- Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.\n- Try to get a bigger place\n- Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.\n\nWould I go back? Definitely. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Average food, slightly above average prices for the quality/taste, average price for the location, lack-luster service.\n\nThis place (the location, the actual building itself, etc.) could be so much more.  I wish they would either step it up, or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential.\n\nUntil then, there are other dining options in Regent Square and they should be explored. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cute store...love browsing, great place to pick up unique gifts for friends. Worth a stop in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was looking for a local place to continue my new obsession with gel nails.  A positive review on another site led me to Jillian Vaughan within Salon Surreal Salon & Day Spa.  We went with a dark navy Shellac and gel overlay.  Spring pastel colors be damned-my nails looked neat and super shiny!  She was super quick and the nails had a nice density.  They have grown out well and have not chipped.  Thanks Jillian! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nice place. Close to my work and people are really good and the service is really fast. I personally like the mangolia beef. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is by far the worst UPS store I have dealt with. A package was not delivered to my work because it didn't have a suite number on the address, a suite number is not necessary because we have a front desk that handles deliveries. Then they mailed me a letter stating that I had to go to Middleton to pick it up or they would send it back to the store. I live no where near Middleton and refuse to pick it up. So hope and pray that you do not have to deal with this store. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My wife went to Cali nails to get manicure and pedicure with gel, they are extremely rude and way overcharge! Then the finished product was crappy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Nails were crooked told me my fingers were crooked bubbled gel polish whole nail not even polished <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Mmmmm- bread, mmmmmm. To me, the bread makes a great sandwich, and pane bianco comes through, absolutely!\n\nThe sandwiches are always fresh and I always dig the surprise of what the special is going to be each time I walk in. They are usually traditionally European in style, and hit the spot. Regardless, the stable sandwiches are fantastic, especially if you like fresh basil. It just pops in your mouth. Awesome!\n\nIf you're up for a nice picnic, get a sandwich, head over to Indian Steele park and chow down. Don't forget to look for the chocolate in the bottom of the sack! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped here on our way home from the dells for a quick lunch. The staff was friendly and the restaurant  was clean. \nOur kids each had a cheeseburger kids meal which came with fries or applesauce and choice of a drink (we did milk). Also on the kids bag there is a coupon for a free scoop of ice cream with your choice of toppings! Even on this cold day the custard was amazing! My husband had a butter burger and fries. Everything was tasty!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered them last night for the first time and it was pretty bad.  I actually thought they were the Chinese place on Tatum and Bell, turns out I was wrong.  \n\nI ordered Chicken Fried Rice and it was seriously an embarrassment to the Chinese culture.  Probably all Americanized Chinese food is an embarrassment, but you get my point.  \n\nMy rule of thumb is that if you are going to eat at an \""ethnic\"" food place, the people working/cooking there should be of whatever decent the food that is being served is, that wasn't the case here.  \n\nMajor thumbs down. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  you can't beat a fairly centrally-located grocery store that is open 24-7 BUTTT the smell in there is ughhh.  Years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc.    You get the picture .    The high-point is perhaps the hot foods that you can get over in the deli.-area.  Some really good \""soul-food\"" .  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and etc... I will go out of my way for that stuff, sometimes ... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh! Today is dark, dank, and dreary! I woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup. So out into the gloom I go! I shop here often so this review will probably be modified the next time I visit because I usually really like it here. \n\nEarlier in the week I stopped to pick up a salad and two vegetable panang curries. I like them for lunch when I work at the office. They are not the best ever but I like them because they are pretty spicy and fill me up. This time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies. I pretty much gagged when I attempted to lunch. \n\nSince today I was in need of hot foods I decided to take back these lunches. I don't know if anyone else returns things to grocery stores but $10 bucks is $10 bucks that would go towards my lunch today. Better they pay for the crappy food instead of letting it sit in my fridge while I watch it go bad with a grump face. I had my receipt and took it to customer service. \n\nThe lady was not very nice about it and questioned \"" is that normally packaged like that?\"" to two other employees. The one guy said \"" looks like she ate it and spit back out\"" Seriously?! GROSS! Then she wanted me to go with her and talk to the hot foods department. I declined because I didn't want it!!  Plus I didn't feel great! What more to the story is there?  I won't ever get it again and the attitude towards me because I dared to return poor quality food was not needed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is just about the paint department, only.  The workers in that department there are phenomenal but the lack of staffing in the paint department is ridiculous.  You can count on them to do their best,  but it is hard to deal with.  I used to be in there a lot.  All of the workers bust their guts trying to get the orders out and correct.  They are exceptionally helpful and try their best.  Apparently, the management (or corporate) doesn't care, or doesn't want to retrain and hire more workers to cover the paint department, or doesn't want to pay, or doesn't care if they have workers comp claims or whatever.  That is a tough department with high volume.  If you go for paint, try for Friday nights or some other off time, due to the backlog.  Whenever possible,  I have moved my purchases over to another specialty paint store only due to the lack of staffing at Home Depot on Thomas Road. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tried to schedule an appointment today as a new patient because I broke my hand in a motorcycle accident, and was turned down. Receptionist said they take one new patient a day and as of 6/14 they are already booked until July. What? No sense of urgency. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \n\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The appetizer was bruschetta.  Essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings.  Two of the three were good, but the brocolinni topped one was not my taste.  Certainly, this was NOT worth the $12 price.  Our dinner was pizza.  The crust was very good - almost like a soft, warm, flat breadstick.  Sadly, the pizza was sparsely topped with cheese and sausage.\n\nOur server was attentive, almost to a fault.  The restaurant was excessively loud - we couldn't hear the waitress rattle off the soup, appetizer or entree specials (seven specials in total).\n\nWhile the food was not bad, I can't justify the prices or quantities.  In fact, I really didn't pull up Yelp to rate this restaurant...I'm actually looking for a place to go eat since I'm still famished after \""eating\"" here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I have tried several places. Thus place is the best. Seth will customize anything you like. It's awesome <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've only been here for happy hour and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Margaritas for $3 and food items for $3, $4, or $5. I had two margaritas and a chicken quesadilla and spent only $10. Can't really complain about that. The bartenders are cute and friendly and they have MLB Network. What more does a girl need? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't even know where to begin to point out all the sucks about Macayo's.. they have NO redeeming qualities about them. Greasy chips, tasteless watery salsa and horrible food!\n\nWe ate at this location twice and both times we ordered the mini chimi's which BOTH times came to the table frozen in the middle! Uhg! Most learn from their mistakes, not here.. they make the same mistakes and obviously don't care enough to try to make things right.  Both entree's were served to us at room temperature. Chicken Quesadailla and the Baja Enchilada. \n\nIf you want to have decent Mexican food please, go somewhere else! For this style of food I think I would prefer Carlos O'briens. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have taken my dogs to Amigo forever, and when they told me what a bad dog I had and to never bring him back I was a little hurt. But I still took my other dogs there until I found a stray pit mix wandering the streets. I took him there to see if he had a microchip and the lady told me to immediately take him to the pound because he will undoubtedly try to kill me in my sleep. Long story short, i have a pit mix myself now who is sweet as pie and would never \""kill me in my sleep.\"" My thoughts are, they shouldnt go around telling people terrible things like that and focus more on HELPING the animals <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Precision Imports is amazing.  \n\nI'm trying to sell my '99 Dodge Stratus, and a couple of potential buyers complained about a whining noise on acceleration.  I took the car in to Bill Luke Dodge last week, where they replaced the alternator.  I had a pretty bad customer service experience there, but they fixed the noise.  \n\nCome Saturday afternoon, I went to close the car's hood after showing it, and it wouldn't latch.  I was so upset---I'm moving next weekend, so I don't have any more time to waste with my car in the shop.  My dad and brother have been taking their cars to Precision Imports for years, and my dad suggested calling Frank and Al to see if they could take a look at it today.  I called first thing this morning, and they said to bring it in.  When I arrived, they were so busy that I didn't think they'd be able to get to my car today.  But Frank offered to take a look at it right away while I waited, and he immediately realized that Bill Luke had forgotten to replace two bolts that attach the latch mechanism to some support beams.  He grabbed a couple of bolts from the back and installed them free of charge.  I was out of there within 10 minutes, and my hood latch works fine now.  \n\nThese guys are honest and great at what they do.  If I wasn't moving out of town soon, I would never take a vehicle anywhere else again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They were super helpful. I brought in a ski jacket that had been beat up and when I got it back I swear it looked brand new....as white as when I had first bought it. They even offered to deliver it to me.  These guys are AMAZING!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  On my first day working in CLT, my team member raved about this restaurant and their daily lunch specials.\n\nSooooo, the Shrimp Creole, in a nutshell is one of the Tuesday specials. Its pretty much rice (that's not cooked all the way), embryo shrimp (of the frozen kind from your local grocer), and red spicy sauce (umm, creole sauce?). I tried my best, but I could only eat a 1/4 of the plate, and really that much b/c I was hungry. \n\nWe were seated quickly and the food came in 6min....so I was able to make it back to the office ontime. Guess that's worth 2 stars eh? <|endoftext|>

Mike and Kathy, the owners, really go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.  Never does a visit pass where I walk through the door and I hear Mike say, \""HEY JILL!!!!\""  Or have Kathy ask how Little C is doing.  :)  \n\nFresh product.  Like seriously fresh.  J and I always get the Blimpie Best, the Blimpie Way, with hot and sweet peppers added.  Seriously, so good!!  We get Little C a meatball sandwich, hold the bread.  He gobbles the meatballs down.  C is all about flavor, nothing bland for that kid.  So you know they have to be good meatballs!  :)\n\nI'll never step foot into another Subway again. \nIf you have yet to try Blimpie's yet, what are you waiting for!?!? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Banker came out to do a bid on some additional cellulose insulation in our attic.  Instead, based on recommendation by Grant Gosselin due to the allergy issues I have, as well, poor attic design (which had little/no insulation in spots) we did Spray Foam Insulation.  Let me tell you, amazing.\n\nThere was 2 step process, the first part went well and our whole home was slated the week after Memorial Day.  Due to some scheduling issues, there were delays which could have pushed the Foam for an entire week.  Grant stepped up and got 2 crews on a Saturday to complete the job.  As well, we had 2 additional visits to clean up some issues  While the issues were minor, Grant and Banker got everything taken care of with flying colors!\n\nNow our AC is running at a max 5-7hrs a day (compared to 24x7) during the heat.  The energy savings is amazing and I would highly recommend anyone in the valley to consider spray foam.  While it costs more up front (and there is some HVAC work to be done) the long term savings are incredible! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good for their simplicity, they have this cheapo little sandwich called a \""skinny\"" that is just meat and bread.  Of course, if you want anything else on it they start jacking up the price, even for mayo or veggies.  Pretty good though for a quicky snack. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm from Chicago suburbs, so I'm used to townie dive bars and this place is great! The service was great! Richard, the manager was fantastic and made us feel at home. They were playing the Hawks game on the tvs and any bar playing the Hawks is a bar of mine! You HAVE to try the virtual bowling game! So much fun!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bowling+ Alcohol+Rock and Roll+ Cool Lights = Good Times..and low bowling scores!!!!\n\n\nSo AMF is OK..I have experienced better.  This location is your typical hometown bowling alley minus the line dancing or Karoke on Friday and Saturday nights...at least that's what my hometown bowling alley had.\n\nOh wait so does this AMF in the bar...speaking of the bar...most of the staff here sucks and for the majority are probably older then this bowling alley itself, the drinks suck for the most part...the only thing I have had here that tastes halfway decent is the Long Island Ice Tea...but even a blind monkey could not mess making one of these drinks it is virtually impossible. \n\nPrices are OK, the Rock and Roll bowling is cool but I think it is about time this place maybe did a remodel, all the balls are quite old and most of them need a good refurbishing. Plus it is kind of dirty, but what can you expect for a Bowling Alley..just go and look at the mix of freaks on any league night. \n\nNUFF SAID!!!:)\n\nI am still searching for a \""GOOD\"" bowling alley. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago.  This is an Italian restaurant/sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders.  Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity...all top notch.\n\nThe burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries.  How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries???  \n\nCan't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Do NOT expect timely service....or really any service at all.  Thankfully, due to them not getting me a quote because \""they are busy\"", I found Andrews Party Rentals and went with them for an event.  Also, as noted in other reviews, keep in mind that they will not actually bring the items to the location, but actually only dump them off curbside.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not keen on dragging tables, linens, heaters, ,etc off of the curb and into the actual location of the event.  I gave them 1 star only because you have to in order to post a review. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  2 stars only because the service was good.  Food sucked. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really loved the atmosphere of this place. It reminded me of one of my favorite bars in Chicago so it really felt like home. The bartender was a great guy who was friendly and kept the drinks coming. I saw a few fun bands while I was there and the sound was great. Anyone looking for a friendly environment with good service and great sound should definately check this place out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. \n\nProceed with caution.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ambiance is nice but the food lacks taste and is overpriced.. I also found it interesting that the waitress couldn't remember our order to save her life. Came back on several occasions to ask what we ordered. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am a bit partial to this bar... Our Band (Screaming Ant) plays there all the time. The bar it'self  has been around along time and shows it's age... But what's inside are the nicest folks I ever ran across in my life...  \n\nIt has pool, Large tv's for Sport games! Live Music!\n\nThe entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just don't find anywhere else!\n\nNow,  besides the playing there I have no relations with anyone in the place, and all I know is that when I ask the owner if I could use the bar for an event to raise money for my sister, who has been diagnosed with cancer. With out a blink of an he said yes and they have been great help at helping me organize the event.\n\nThe bar has a huge parking lot and easy access!\n\nThe Bartender and waitresses or really on their game.  \n\nI remembered as I left the place that I was really happy and I wanted to go back. \n\nWhen we get Gigs there our band get's excited that is because the crowds are fun and it seems like we make new friends everything we play. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had such good luck with Sugar's (across the street), I decided to press my luck.  Did you ever watch that show?  I felt like there was a little voice in my head screaming \""no whammies\"" as I walked through the door, and as soon as I did, this little red devil was jumping up and down laughing, knowing I had gone too far.\n\nWhere the staff at Sugar's is friendly, the staff at Texas Ranch is surly.  They leave the impression that they would rather punch you than serve you, and given the neighborhood you're in, they just might.\n\nThough signs on the outside proclaim breakfast specials for a few bucks ($2.75, if I recall), I don't remember seeing them on the menu, and I think I spent close to $6, just for the food.  After a drink, tax and a tip, I was out closer to $10.\n\nTo make matters worse, the food wasn't that great, it was served only after waiting for a while, and it wasn't exactly what I ordered (my over-medium eggs were scrambled).  I didn't think the staff would be amenable to giving me an updated set of eggs, and I figured the rest of my food would get cold in the process, so I went with it, and my soft drink went empty in the process.\n\nIt's definitely possible that I hit them on a bad day, but I'd much rather brave traffic to get across the street to Sugar's - or even across the bridge to McDonald's or Wendy's (if they start serving breakfast) than go through that again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have taken my dog here for extended boarding twice.  Both times he was sick when I picked him up.  The latest illnesses include mange.  If you love your pet, go somewhere else.  The place is dirty, and they are indifferent to anything except charging for extra services. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Normaly I would give this a better review, not this time though. Ok, rant time! Jalepeno shmear, put some on the damn bagel... oh and when I see you dont, I decided to order an extra side and considering it is very freaking small you charge $1.64. Pfffffft! NY Bagels on Deer Valley WAY BETTER! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tim Robbins was our server!!!\n\nJust kidding, it was really Corey, but the resemblance was pretty amazing. Anyway, I had a fantastic dinner here the other day which started off with a delicious glass of  Seghesio Zinfandel ($12) and an amuse bouche that was some sort of minty-pea gazpacho soup. Both delicious, leaving me excited for the rest of the meal. \n\nFor my appetizer I got their Hydroponic Butter Lettuce Salad ($13) which was super tasty with the caramelized nectarine dressing. I found the the toasted pistachios one of the best parts of the salad as it helped offset the sweetness from the dressing, which was always a yummy experience in my mouth. The bread service came with choices between a foccacia and a mild sourdough to try with their three different spreads consisting of a goat cheese olive oil emulsion, some sort of pepper pesto olive oil, and a spicy butter mixture. The pepper pesto spread was the table favorite.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak ($32) that come atop a scrumptious basil blue cheese risotto mixed with chopped portabella mushrooms and drizzled with a roasted tomato garlic olive oil emulsion. Oh my gosh, so good! I was debating between the Hanger Steak or the Featured Risotto, but get the steak because you get the best of both worlds! My lovely date ordered Pork Tenderloin Noisettes ($26) that wasn't nearly as exciting as my entree, but still good.\n\nDessert time left us trying the Classic Creme Brulee ($9) and Apples on the Rocks ($9). The creme brulee was the typical rich taste, but it came with a buttermilk blue cheese cookie! Oh man, that led to another party in my mouth with the combo of sweet and salty goodness. The Apple dessert came in a lowball glass (get it, \""on the rocks\"") which was pretty cute. It came with a scoop of apple spice ice cream and a scoop of vanilla cream ontop of an oatmeal cranberry cookie and drizzled with caramel. It was good, but the blue cheese cookie was really memorable so I recommend getting the brulee for that reason.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the top of North Mountain in North Phoenix with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. This creates a fantastic view overlooking Central Phoenix from wherever you are seated in the restaurant (but if you can, request to be my the window). Also, try and come around sunset because its really neat to see the transition from day to the sparkly lights at night. There is a patio that would be fun to dine at when the weather is cooler. I find the prices to be extremely fair with portions and taste, so don't let that deter you from trying this restaurant.\n\nFive stars for impeccable service by Tim Robbins, aka Corey, quality tasting food, and, of course, the view! I want to come back very soon! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's a local treasure that may be overlooked in the city of Charlotte. However, make no mistake about it, the Mimosa Grille is a rise above the typical local city purveyor of fusion cuisine. While my experience was derived from Restraunt week have to say that had the bill been full price I would have been glad to have paid the normally expected total for this culinary delight. Beyond the meal, my server was attentive, knowledgeable and courteous to my requests and expectations. My only qualm would be that the hostess was aloof and unconcerned. A common issue overlooked by even the most establishments. If I could offer any advice to the manager is that a hostess is the am ambassador to your production. It's the first person I see and the last person to say goodbye. Please take consideration to the significance to this persons affect on every customers experience and is exreamly important in creating a premier dinning experience. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was my second trip to the garden and both times I got to enjoy lunch on Ullman Terrace.  Two highlights of this visit were the Chihuly exhibit and the concert given by Try Me Bicycle.  Later in the spring the annual butterfly exhibit is really great too.  Although pressed for time we managed to see and photograph almost all of the Chihuly glass exhibit.  Sometime I would like to go in early March which is normally the best time for the flowers to bloom.  There are around 2 miles of well maintained trails and lots of employees and volunteers eager to answer any questions or show you something new.  The plants and other stuff on display are well documented. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had a week off from work recently.  I needed it to take a little break and I decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'Burgh?\n\nTo say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\n\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \""stuffed and mounted\"" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\n\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\n\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \n\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \""Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\"".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \n\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Soba had become one of our regular spots for big family dinners. Most recently we came for my sisters birthday. I was able to get reservations for 7 at the last minute for Saturday night. We had a long table next to the waterfall on the first floor. It was a high top so it wasn't the most comfortable but for a last minute reservation it worked.\n\nWe started with the calamari which was delicious and then dived right into entrees. I had what I always get- the seared tuna. It's crusted with sesame seeds and comes with rice, BBQ sauce, Kim chee, and pickled vegetable. It's so delicious I never get anything else. I had bits of my moms duck which was also delicious and the boyfriends sea bass was amaze! \n\nWe did not stay for dessert at this visit but in the past I have enjoyed the ice cream with cashew dessert. Soba is really so good. And it looks to beautiful. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This little Thai treasure consistently delivers!  I have ate there and had carry out many times.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We go hear often to cheer on the Panthers. The stadium is nice nothing special. Good selection of food that is reasonably priced. The restrooms are never far away and plenty of parking, at a hefty price though. The problem I have is if you want to stand up and cheer some wine and cheeser will yell at you to sit down. It happens every game. We are at a football game here people come on. If you want to sit down, watch it on your couch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was skeptical after reading the negative reviews, but it's close so I decided to try it out. This place is amazing, no waiting, quick friendly service. The food is so good. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I have tried is delicious.  I highly recommend giving Little Shanghai a try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to admit, I kind of thought Benihana was fictitious until we moved to Pittsburgh... and then low and behold, there was one right near where we live. The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Slightly awkward... But decent.. kinda over priced, kinda over hyped...but thats what i expected. Went here for my Beautyface's birthday dinner. I think we would try to visit the lounge next time, but I doubt we would return for the whole dinner thing. Should have sit on the patio instead of the stuffy dining area... Just not our cup of tea... the mansion is nice though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am not a big ice cream or frozen custard fan.  I had never been to Jarlings before and I have lived in this area all my life.  I started a new job and was asked if I wanted something from Jarlkings.  Since they were buying I said OK I will try it.  I ordered the special for simplistic sakes.  I surely could not pick one thing out of all the choices they have.  The special was a carmel apple snowstorm and it is fantastic.  I ordered a small but I couldn't finish it so I put it in the freezer and ate it again the next day and I think I liked it a little better the second time because it was frozen more than the first if that makes any sense. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review comes at least six months after two visits; one in which I was disappointed and the second, with which I was seriously pissed.\n   I can't reasonably dispute the positive reviews since I can't imagine anyone bothering to promote a place they don't actually like and yet, and not for the first time, my experiences here were worlds away from you more fortunate Yelpers. Yes, the service was fast and friendly but at a price I'm no longer willing to pay.\n   Visit 1:   I picked the budget friendly option of a lunch special to go of beef w/ red curry. At home, sipping a bit of the curry, I was treated to a complimentary burst of flavors that were very palate friendly. I thought I'd gotten lucky (only food-wise, can we talk?) and would be able to chalk up a new go-to Thai place, but as I spooned the dish over the rice and forked my way through the meal I became increasingly aware of a mounting saltiness that became relentless in the end. I know that people share a varied tolerance for salt; some just a little and some can't get enough. I can happily crunch through a half bag of salt and vinegar chips so I'm not exactly a salt sissy. But obviously too much of it in an otherwise tasty concoction just makes it a mess not worth serving. That's my vote on this one.\n   Plus, the egg roll was ridiculous. I didn't expect it crisp after the ride home but neither did I imagine the indestructable toughness I bit into. After a major effort to get the first bite down I realized that the dough wrap was at least twice the thickness of any roll I've EVER had and that I found so little filling of any kind that I had to check it out. Surgery STAT revealed contents of precisely two (2) bean sprouts and one (1) slender shred of cabbage. Period. That's it. In the trash. That was my budget lunch. Disappointing, but not bad enough to write them off just yet.\n   Visit 2:   Thought I'd take a chance and order what I really wanted instead of another 'test' meal.\n   In trying to recreate a truly great experience in the past from a place no longer around, I ordered Pineapple Curry With  Roasted Duck And Tomato from their list of 'Specialties' Sound good? Well, the curry WAS good; not too salty this time.\n   But back home, I soon realized that my parachute had failed to open: picture no more than a dozen slivers of duck, each the size of two toothpics side by side and 3/4 as long. Maybe a quarter OUNCE of meat? Maybe not even..\n   Envision similar sized bits of slimy skin floating around independently, indicating a minimum of four days in the pot, as did the rest of the ingredients.\nNon-ripe tomatoes. In July. In Arizona.\n   Add to this the fact that the kitchen (conspicuously) added what amounted to literally FIVE times the canned pineapple (why ever bother with fresh when you're just using it as a filler anyway?) that a dish this size can realistically support.\n   So that was my 4 minute, 'from order to door', 'Specialty' from Krua for 'only' $15.25 inc. tax.\nI'm absolutely certain they wouldn't have dared serving this 'bottom of the pot' debacle to a sit-down customer without  expecting to see it turned into 'instant wall art' but gambled that a  $15 take away probably wouldn't come back to call them out on this.\n   I'm doing that here. No Mercy; and never again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Got a standard Red Door Facial here.  Great atmosphere- relaxing, friendly staff, clean and upscale.  Skin looks great the day after my facial- extractions removed acne, no peeling or recovery and skin is glowing.  Got a scalp, face and hand massage during my \""facial\"", which was a nice surprise.  Little pricey, but will definitely return! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I haven't been here in awhile, but I definitely miss it. They do hold slightly odd hours as it is a mom and pop joint and they are definitely more of a breakfast place than anything else. Their omelettes are to die for. I'm also a huge fan of their potatoes for breakfast and especially with their gravy. Yum!\nMy boyfriend is more of a burger person but he loves their burgers and fries. They have a few breakfast specials that are just as awesome\nIt is very small. And they do not take reservations to my knowledge. If you go on a Sunday morning you will def be waiting for a table.\nThey never used to accept cards but to my knowledge they recently have begun taking credit cards which is a big plus. This is definitely a mom and pop place you need to try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We reserved a double but there weren't any doubles available when we arrived. So instead they just put a roll-a-way bed into the room. Drinking water from the faucet was also warm. On the other hand staff were nice. Wouldn't recommend this hotel unless everything else is booked since there are much nicer hotels closer to Charlotte in the same price range. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Wong's!  I think it's the best orange chicken in the valley. They use only white meat chicken. I hear their egg rolls and fried rice are the best, too!\n\nWong's is a hole in the wall. There's no getting around it. It's not the prettiest, and if you've ever had to use their restroom you know that they could seriously do some remodeling, but it's clean (just old, and falling apart). The atmosphere is the only thing keeping it from being a 5-star place. The food is top notch! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst drive thru service ever....they didn't tell me the total cost of my order till I got up to the window.  It took a couple mins. before anyone even came to the window, and then I had to sit there for almost 10 mins before I got my food.  A drive thru is suppose a little quicker service of getting your food.  And the food was not worth the price I paid for it.  This is not the first time I've had this kind of service there.  The people working there also don't seem like they want to be there.  I don't know why I even tried going back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've taken my two labs (one full grown and one about 6 months) to Petco at 44th and Thomas multiple times, always to be disappointed.  The prices there are a bargain, but I've never really been satisfied.  I expected to have a similar experience at Petsmart, but before I took them to some fancy grooming salon, I figured I've get Petsmart a shot.\n\nAt Petsmart, I called at 8am and was able to bring my dogs in right away.  They seemed pretty knowledgeable, which I was pleased with because some people don't understand that even though they are labs and have short hair, I still want them clipped.  Its over 100 degree here still in September, I think they appreciate the haircuts.  At $46 each, even for the 6 month pup, it wasn't super cheap, but they had them done in about 4 hours and they both looked great.  No jaggedy marks in their fur from the clippers and they blended the hair on the tail and the head well.  They also cut their nails pretty short, which I like.  I prefer to be able to tell when they've been cut.\n\nNo complaints here, I will be taking my dogs back to Petsmart for their next beauty appointment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of the best BBQ restaurants I've been too. The place looks a little run down, but it only adds character. Open late (til 9:30pm I believe) this is a quick, easy lunch or dinner for us.\n\nMy favorites are the BBQ beef sandwich, potato salad and the cobbler is great too. A definite must! And there are multiple locations throughout the Valley. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One liner:  Ick.\n\nEven the heartiest of cravings for a DQ treat could not make us go here....simply nasty.  Dirty counters, messy machines, and dirty tables.  And super rude staff.\n\nThe ultimate kicker?  Walking in to find the nastiest dust pan sitting right on the counter where they place your food when it is ready.\n\nSeriously...call the health department. We will drive all the way to Sun Prairie rather than ever step foot in this place again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ya know, I've come to this Denny's on and off since moving to Phoenix several years ago.  I usually only frequent this location and one in Tempe.  I'm not really sure when it changed.\n\nHubs and I stopped for breakfast.  We looked at the line @ Matt's (I know there IS no comparison but the line was SOOOOOOOOOOOO long) and turned around to get one of the worst tasting meals and worst service experiences I've had in a long time.  \n\nNow, I understand something going wrong with your order now and again.  But seriously, our waitress was training someone!!!!!  An order was taken and then we were left to fend for ourselves.  Finally another waitress named Crystal (ask for HER if you dare go) stopped by and filled our coffee.  We then waited...and waited.  We saw the cooks working and putting food out that just sat under the lamps.  When we got our grand slams the only thing slightly warm were the eggs.  Sausage?  Stone cold.  Bacon: frigid.  Pancakes, laughable.\n\nAnd when the manager stopped by?  Let's just say that he had a very condescending attitude.  He was basically like; \""well, what do you want me to do about it?\""  Um, manage your people effectively!  Live up to the customer service standards expected of you!  Figure it out.  My husband pretty much put him in his place by giving a detailed description of several things he'd seen done wrong since our arrival.\n\nHe offered us ONE comped meal.  Bill still came to $15 for one breakfast and drinks.  Yikes.  For this kind of money I will stand in line at Matt's and know that eventually I'll get food worth having! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've had it with BofA and this branch in particular.  The parking lot is ridiculously small and presided over by a security guy who takes his job way too seriously (\""No, really, I'm going to the bank!).  Once in you'll be greeted with the ubiquitous \""how's it going?\""  Well, it would be going a hell of a lot better if we could drop the drivel and process my deposit, thank you.  I've switched most of my accounts to Alliance Bank but still have a federal employee withholding account with the bank.  Having carelessly run out of company checks I went in the other day to request a counter check.  \""I'm sorry, we don't do counter checks.\""  Really.  Is it that complicated?  It seems  they do just about everything else because every time I go I'm stuck behind a horde of people with tales of \""the wire transfer was supposed to happen\"" or \""there used to be a lot of money in this account.\""  Does anyone at BofA do banking anymore?  You know, deposits and withdrawals.  Absent of drama, please.\nI honestly believe BofA has made a strategic decision to be the bank for the masses.  That's fine but it no longer includes me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For reasons I can't explain, they choose to clean the soft ice cream machine on Monday which means you can't get any on that day. Even though I didn't walk in until 8pm and they clean it in the morning. Doesn't sound like a good business decision to me so until that is resolved, I'll get me soft ice cream some where else. too bad because this is so close to my house. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This location is the sole reason that after 13 years, we are no longer AirTouch/Verizon customers, and will never, ever be again. I went in to upgrade my phones one afternoon only to be accosted by an angry, pimply faced little elf of an employee. He was disrespectful, got in my face, and talked down to me the entire time when all I had wanted was two new phones. When I got sick of his attitude I demanded a manager and he said there wasn't one. As if. He then called security, which is when I REALLY got mad! I began yelling at the top of my lungs when \""magically\"" a manager appeared out of the back room to investigate the commotion. The manager sent the kid on a \""walk\"" and apologized profusely, saying they've had problems with him before. My question was: WHY THE HELL DOES HE STILL WORK THERE?!?! He asked what he could do to make us happy and I asked for the regional manager's phone number. He provided the regional manager's cellular number, which I promptly called. After explaining what had happened, both managers agreed to cancel our two accounts with no early cancellation fees. Woot. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food was great, as were the prices. Shared the 2 for $20 with my husband & left full. I had the chicken fajitas & he had the honey chicken crisper things. Also had the cookie skillet for dessert, yummm! Service was good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Didn't even know this was a DDD place. We just searched Yelp for something decent in Pittsburgh. The Dor-Stop did not disappoint. The stuffed raspberry French toast was insane. The waitress warned me it was really sweet, but I felt that it was perfectly balanced.\n\nDefinitely check this place out, and don't be freaked out at the potential of long waits. We waited 20 mins at 10 am on a Saturday. You'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Darlene is awesome. I had to have my bridesmaid dress taken in in the bust and had to have it done in under a week. Darlene did an awesome job on the alteration and had it done in six days. I paid $45, which seems totally reasonable to me. I'll definitely go back to Darlene for my other alterations and repairs. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I took my two children here after going to the museum on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a fruit plate to start with and then we were going to share a hamburger.  She asked how I'd like it cooked and I said \""medium\"".  \n\nWhen my fruit plate was dropped off by another person, no silverware or napkins were left.  We started eating the fruit with our fingers.  The waitress walked by and saw us.  I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!  But the hamburger was WELL done and absolutely tasteless.  There was nothing on it.  I had to ask for mustard.  When I ordered the hamburger I told her it was for us 3 to split.  She just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras.  I had to cut the hamburger into pieces and tear one of our drink napkins to put the burgers on for my kids.\nAt this point I was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave.  I asked for the check when she finally walked by a few minutes later (she never came by to ask how anything was).  I didn't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food.  After a long day, I just wanted to leave.  But I would never come back again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place definitely has an upscale loungy feel to it. The only way I found out about it is because I work right in that area. I can see how it would be a nice change of pace from the typical clubs around the valley. It would be a good place to start the evening and maybe impress some people visiting from out of town. \n\nThink of a place you would see in L.A. or Chicago. I have been to places like this in each of these cities, dark, swanky, cool, hip. My secret hint for this place is that you can see certain Suns players come in late at night to hang out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \""Oyster\"" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better Pittsburgh lunch- not even Primanti's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My fianc\u00e9 and I love George and dragon! We live down the street and ride our bikes there a lot. The owner is very friendly and the bartender is excellent! Try the honey siracha wings they are to die for. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food quality doesn't match the place at all. I think it's ok for a pub but this place is supposed to be a nice place for professional lunches. \nI had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken! \nWith so many options around that area I won't pick this place for lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was referred to this office by my general doctor to have a cyst removed on my arm. After THREE visits, and an emergency visit to my regular doctor to fix the packing,  I was left with a huge scar. I wish I had never gone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love kitchen stores, and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh. Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware. None of them are really any good for any of us. I won't get into what the dangers of them are, but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.\n\nI started looking into enamel coated cookware, Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8, 10, and 12 inch pans. Like non stick, no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca. If you love stainless steel cookware, they have anything you want from All Clad, made right in Canonsburg Pa. There's Fiesta ware from Wheeling, and If you want Emeral's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well, they have a full service kitchen in back. Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space, but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they've prepped. \n\nIt's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices. But well worth it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We purchased our wedding bands from the Park road location. The service was excellent helping us find exactly what we were looking for. When no wedding band matched exactly, we had ours custom made and they came out even better than expected. They were up front about the timing and what they would do to make the molding etc. I enjoyed my experience with brownlee jewelers and the staff. I will go back for my next jewelery purchase. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not very good, this was probably some of the worst indian food I've had.  (I've been pretty spoiled)  At one point there was something that was hard in my food and I cringed when I bit down.  I'm not sure what it was.  I'm used to very well flavored Indian food, and the curry was bland.\nThe service was good, and it was inexpensive, but I think I'll try some other local places first before returning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OH DEAR GOD. Someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets. I almost lost my appetite after using the women's restroom.\n\nThis Subway has NOT been closed as may have been reported by other Yelpers (I was just there on Friday), but may be it should be. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is an arena. They have so many seats it's crazy. You've never seen so many seats. They also have really big TVs. It's really fun and nicer than a lot of other arenas. Except when the Suns lose, then it's just a really big room filled with a lot of really sad people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm from Philly, which of course nothing in Az can compare to a real cheese steak. I've visited this place a couple times, and  as the saying goes,  third time was  a charm(not exactly). The guy in the kitchen was rude to me when i tried to grab a few ketchup packets and napkins near the register.I honestly never sat down and ate in there, which I didn't know napkins and ketchup were on the tables. What made my visit worse was that a gentlemen behind me in line did exactly the same thing,and   nothing was said to him.I felt like the kitchen guy was border line yelling at me as if I was going to steal all the napkins and ketchup packets from the  other paying customers... who would do such a thing??? lol. Anyways, my cheese steak was nothing special, which I was hoping it would be on my third visit.And the way i was treated was unnecessary. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh is also my neighborhood watering hole--I'm so fortunate. The food is great (especially love the ginger sunflower dish and spicy peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. You have to appreciate what they can do without meat or other animal products. The drinks are amazing.\n\nThe hipster atmosphere reminds me of Portlandia. Staff is friendly. Gets busy at brunch time on the weekends.\n\nQuiet Storm gets 4 for its food, 5 for cool factor, and 5 overall. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great chicken fried steak in phoenix but if it was in Texas it would be just good <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really enjoy this place. It is usually busy but we still find a place to sit.\nI almost always order the NYer with pastrami on rye. Just too yummy. I have on occasion order other foods and yeah it is all good.\nOne thing that does sort of freak me out is when I get in line and it is my turn to order the guy taking the order always alerts his co-workers to look at me and they mutter in Spanish quickly and then smile and go back to business. It has happened every time I have been to this or any other location. I know why they are looking but they are so blatant it is strange. Oh and yeah some white guys understand Spanish too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place for Asian fare, whether you're stocking a full fridge or just craving a slab of Hi-Chew. The whole place is cleaner and brighter than the other oriental stores around town. Prices are fair. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I finally had the opportunity to try this place. I went for dinner instead of the lunch buffet. My friend and I shared the appetizer platter, butter chicken, and lamb vindaloo. Everything was piping hot and fresh. Service was timed well even with a large group in the restaurant. Good portions. The appetizer platter and the lamb vindaloo were delicious. The butter chicken was too buttery for my liking. Maybe it is a different style/region of cooking. I am still on the hunt for a place that serves butter chicken that will taste almost like my friend's mother's butter chicken. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible. Sad, tired, low-end joint with food that is just not good. No redeeming characteristics. I'll never go back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very helpful, all of your favorite titles, monthly pull for your books, guest artists/ signings, sales events, friendly staff.....this place really has it all.\n\nHere's a huge plus: no gamers or D&D type people here. Straight up comics. When you walk in the average age is above 14 so if you're an adult, you feel a little more comfortable here.\n\nDefinitely one of the best shops in the valley <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am not sure I can say more than has already been said. I loved Dr. Heather, and when she left I was saddened beyond words. But then I met Dr. Mastores and realized there was life after Heather.  The thing is, EVERYONE here is nice! My husband and son go here as well, I converted him over soon after we started dating. It was so easy...the service and the one stop shopping.  Just stop in and say Hello and you won't want to leave. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Our daughter has been attending classes here for about 5 years.   SUPER professional environment.  Very efficient staff.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the best Chinese in campus-town.  Some dishes are not as good as others (such as eggplant and spinach).  I recommend the crispy tofu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just went for the very first time. I was having a nostalgic moment and decided I would hit the local branch near my home. Growing up, my mother bought several Kinds of Easter Candy that were always in the basket. Then she continued the tradition with my children. My mother passed away 8 years ago and this year I suddenly remembered the candies. I went in last week and immediately spotted the candies. The service was delightful and they seemed happy to help a newcomer. I mailed all the candies to my grown children who were delighted with the memories created of their beloved Grandmother. I'm really happy that I sauntered in and I plan to continue the tradition as well as starting some new ones. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  \""Every Christmas Story Ever Told\"" was slow and not that funny. Spoiled by comedy and improv options in bigger cities, we expected something more fast paced. The first half DRAGGED. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was the first gourmet chocolate shop I went into and I spent a lot of time here debating what to buy - considering the chocolate melting during the bus ride, what I actually want to eat, etc. It was difficult choosing and I finally ended up with mik chocolate covered pretzels, a hazelnut chocolate bar and one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate Guittard bar. I really wish I bought more, but everything in the store was on the pricier side and I really didn't see anything else I liked. This is definitely a good place to visit when in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is hands down my favorite antique shop. I've been to most of the shops in phoenix and this one always stands out to me. I always seem to find something that I have to have wether it be some old black and white photos or a bear rug! The staff is friendly and will help you find what your looking for if you require something specific. They will also call the booth owner if you would like to make an offer on a piece. Everything is reasonably priced for the most part and the content stays filtered. I mean I have nothing against people who collect toys and beetles memorabilia but I'm just glad that at this store I don't have to sift through it.  2 thumbs up for sure! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The atmosphere at Pane Bianco was the first thing I noticed when walking in... I definitely felt like I stepped out of Phoenix and into a quirky European bistro.  Menu is limited for lunch but the options were solid and made my decision difficult!\n\nI ended up going with the market sandwich which on that day, featured a sunny side up farm egg, burrata and asparagus and it was DELICIOUS.  A much larger portion than I expected, when combined with the high quality of the ingredients, justifies the slightly higher price.  My DP decided on a slice of their famous pizza, which are reheated slices during lunch.  I was kind of disappointed by this, but the bite I stole from him was still crunchy, cheesy, and tasty, so it didn't seem to make a difference.  \n\nI know it's only March, but my east coast skin was roasting in the sun at the tables out front.  An umbrella would have been delightful, but that's literally my only complaint.  Great food, service - I'd definitely return! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Saba's is one of our favorite local places since the service, food and menu prices never disappoint!  \nOur family of four is routinely sat within minutes and the service is always prompt, polite and welcoming. \nWe have recently tried to incorporate more vegetables in out diet so we have frequented Saba's more often and continue to enjoy this great establishment which has the best falafel pita, hands down! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I go here to buy coffee and for the occasional espresso before work.  The coffee has always been high quality and inexpensive - most varieties are around $10/lb which is certainly cheaper than any other whole bean you can find, even in supermarkets.  (that 8 oclock crap is roughly $8 for a 12 ounce bag, meaning $12 a pound, for THAT).  I am a dark roast fan - big fan of Fortune's French Roast and Espresso Roast.  They have a variety of dark, light,. blends, flavored, and decaf.  The people there have been consistently nice even when I went in the first time and didn't know how to work the grinder because I'm a jagoff.  The way the cafe is set up reminds me of the cafes in Italy where you are meant to come in, throw some hot espresso down your throat, maybe sit a while if there are any chairs open, maybe chat a while before going about your day.  I have no complaints. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They have some great harder-to-find packaged items (melon bars - yes, please!), but they sold us a whole bagful of ROTTEN purple yams!!  What?!  We got home and started preparing them before we figured it out. GROSS. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So, this was my first time visiting McCormicks and I was really looking forward to it as I had heard so many great things about the food , service etc..\n  We arrived on a Wednesday evening and there were 6 of us. The restaurant was pretty packed but none the less our server was friendly and did his best (Steve) under the circumstances.  \n     We ordered apps, salads, wine and entrees. I ordered the stuffed salmon and was expecting it to be amazing but it fell short. The outer parts were overcooked and the inside was raw! not to mention that the crab and brie filling wasn't even as tasty as it could've been. Everyone else seemed to love their food (filo wrapped halibut was a hit) so maybe I just got the bad food on an off day. I will say that the bar service and drinks were excellent.\n  Again our server was good but I am hesitant to visit this location again. Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location for better luck next time :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This driver was sitting outside our hotel in Old Town Scottsdale so we jumped in and gave him the address ..  The guy did not turn on his meter and the ride was $3.00 more than the ride back , which was in a Green Discount Cab taxi, with a meter turned on !  Not only did he add in his tip but he also dropped us off a block away from the address we gave him . Very slimy feeling and based on other comments it appears we are not alone . Spring Training tourist be warned :  Be very careful of  them and other \""indy\"" drivers. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hard to say exactly what you should order, but i've eaten here 5+ times, all three meals.  the service has always been superb.  We typically eat here when we stay at Royal Palms, so having a $50 meal credit softens the blow.  Dinner IS pricey...\n\nPresentation is obviously big here.  Portion sizes are just right.  you won't be stuffed...you will have room for 3 courses.  \n\nI generally order something unique here.  not your typical \""filet\""...go to Donovan's or Dominick's for that.  I think entree's are best.  Apps/soups are #2.  Dessert usually isn't the best part of the meal here.  they almost try too hard with the desserts.  they need to find a couple staples for dessert and make them home runs...i just haven't found that (yet).\n\nBeet salad.  butternut squash soup.  antelope.  lamb.  scallops.  all winners.  enjoy <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.\n\nPizza Hut , a pizza of last resort. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My first dinner in Phoenix turned out to be a very good one thanks to Postino Arcadia. \n\nIt's classy yet casual, good for dinner (if you're more of a snack person) and relaxed despite the more dressy ambience. \n\nEach bruschetta used what tasted like locally sourced seasonal vegetables. I especially loved the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes bruschetta (of course, you can never go wrong with BURRATA!). \n\nThe waiter also made an excellent recommendation for beer (dark beer lover speaking). I forget the name but ask for the darkest beer and you won't be disappointed. \n\nOverall, a refreshing first time dining experience in Phoenix! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine. christine's conduct/attitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude, unprofessional, and insulting. not only did she not respond to my facebook question on her salon's page, but only after an email to her, did she reply with a curt answer, and to add insult to injury, she's banned me from further posting/commenting on the salon's facebook page. i didn't realize an inquiry regarding a product for which i'm paying wasn't permitted. instead of setting the record straight (which should've been done), she elected to ignore my question, delete it from facebook, and then ban me from the salon's page. wow. that said, i'll really miss katie, as she's a great hairstylist and colorist. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We have been to this restaurant multiple times. The restaurant serves both Asian and Italian dishes. This is my hubby's favorite place for ramen noodles and he told me the broth is pretty close to the flavors you'd find in ramen houses in Tokyo. According to one of the employees, the broth cooks for at least 6 to 8 hours to develop its rich flavor. The pasta with squid and cod roe is also a favorite. Too bad we live so far from it, otherwise we would go much more frequently.  Be sure after dinner to stop by Snoh Creamery a few doors down. The shaved ice is creamy and delicious. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I absolutely adore this place.  Great location, right down the street from a friends house so we never have to deal with parking issues.  Everyone who works there is really sweet and one of the older bartenders is great to talk with.  I used to stop by so often the bartender would take a few glasses of wine off the bill.  Whenever people come in from out of town I have to take them here.  They have the best bruschetta!  I have tried to recreate some of them at home and while they have been good, they are no match for Postino.  It is a great place for a relaxing lunch, romantic dinner, or night out with the girls! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The hamburgers are delicious the service was great the malts are the best <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tried this spot on a recommendation from a friend.  His words \""dumpy building, but great food\"".  Oh he was right about the building!  But the food was horrible.  Let me define horrible in my terms- wouldn't feed it to a dog.  The beef taco was so dry even drenching it with their mediocre salsa didn't help.  Save your money, T Bell is an upgrade compared to this joint. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> yeah. that's right.  I'm yelping a layover with 4 stars. \n\nCLT knows how to do a layover right! I found myself sitting on a rocking chair in the main terminal atrium, (note: go upstairs on the landing for a little more space and quite) listening to someone play on the grand piano below me, eating frozen yogurt from TCBY's new store called Yovana, and relaaaaaaaxing. And looking around, I was not the only person who seemed a little less stressed  in this tree lined terminal. Everyone seemed to soak in the great amenities and take advantage of the opportunity of able leg room and overhead space! This airport also offers some great food selections and shops so you can stock up on supplies for the next leg of your trip. If I need another layover, I'm booking it through CLT! hell yeah. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\n\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \n\nAmbiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \""musts\"" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I first learned of this place by invite. Two of my closest friends suggested Rosita's Place as a place to meet for lunch and since my first visit, I was hooked and with any luck, you might be too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Embarrassment - every single time. This is a nice area... A really nice area, but the trash seems to flock to this Walmart from miles around. Fact: I've sent in so many pictures to peopleofwalmart.com from this location! Where in the h*ll do they come from and why here?! Today, I practically watched a ghetto women beat her children and scream at them bc she wanted to check herself out in a pair of walmart's hottest sunglasses and they kids wouldn't stop asking her questions. It was so bad that my daughter told me she was scared. Customers were staring, the employees did nothing. So embarrassing. The remodel is most likely going to look great when finished ... But by reading precious posts, I think the damage has been done for this location, and a shiny new facade can't change it's reputation as the \""scary Walmart\"". Head to Desert Ridge and go to Target Greatland or Home Depot. At least you'll feel safe. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place isn't all that well kept. Rooms have that perfume odor of cheap cleaning fluid. Badly in need of a face lift or a thorough scrubbing. It's convenient to the airport but that's the main benefit. The only reason to stay here is if you don't have a choice. For me it was a company meeting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I got a Groupon for here for my fiancee and mine's anniversary, and we finally were able to get there a month later.  The restaurant was super easy to find and I loved how it was right on the lake.  I spent a lot of time the last few summers in northern WI on a lake, so it was nice to be back on a lake again- brought back good memories!  We did not make a reservation, so it was an hour wait for a table when we arrived.  We hung out in the slightly crowded bar and had a few drinks while we were waiting.  The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!  Our server was attentive all night, even though the restaurant was super busy all night.  By the time we left, I was very full and satisfied. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So this is my first review because it is hard for me to review restaurants. Having worked in the industry for years i am a little more forgiving than most. So we ordered calamari, it came out black but being adventurous i tried it thinking it was a different kind of breading. Boy was i wrong! It was completely burnt. So we sent it back our other food came out and then the new calamari came out.  Much better this time until we got down to the plate. It was the old plate, same lettuce same number lemons we squeezed on the batch. As some one who has cooked for a living i want to know how lazy a person has to be to do that. Probably won't be going back for a while if at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used this place once, and it will be my last. The place reeked of old urine. I'm not sure if someone has used it as a bathroom, and the place never got cleaned, or what? All I know is that it stinks, and not a good smell at that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The service for a group of nine on a thursday night was not only below average, but I have had nicer waiters, better food, and faster service from a McDonald's. The waiter was rude, they over salted all the food, and it was not worth the two for twenty deal that they offer at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Got the rancho and the Greek, not so bad but I probably won't go back... Too heavy for me... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  \n\nThe Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.\n\nMy coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?\n\nBreakfast Breakdown,\n\nThe Food: Delicious!\nThe Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.\nThe Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!\nWould I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.\n5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!\n\nBonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review? Points to the winner! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Buffalo chicken was excellent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  With 32 reviews and 4.5 stars I had high hopes. We were sorely disappointed. \n\nThe Restaurant:  Dated decor, Christmas lights everywhere (in Feb). Poor layout. \nThe Drinks:  bad wine and poorly made vodka cocktail made this a waste of time. \n\nThe Food:  Mediocre would be a compliment. The ziti and tortellini were terribly underseasoned. The salad was lettuce carrots and oil. Even the bread was subpar. \n\nThe Service:  Our server started off well but went downhill fast. No recommendations, MIA for 20 minutes and taking \""the food wasn't too bad\"" as a compliment made this experience unenjoyable. \n\nThe Price:  There's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food.  I can cook better at home. \n\nThe Verdict:  Any other Italian restaurant is a better choice. Pick the next one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Location:4050 Penn Ave Pittsburgh\nPrice: $ 1/2\nService: Good\n\nMy family was really hungry and everywhere my parents visit they always want to try native food. So, I search Viet restaurant on the GPS and it lead us there- I mean if it was apart of the GPS' top 10 it must be good. I feel like being Vietnamese made me more critical on the food when I do go to Vietnamese restaurants. \n\nIt is in a residental neighbourhood downtown.You're able to park along the streets. It was a very humble environment and very cute. The service was okay, they were really nice and never rude. \n\nWe ordered Pho (of course...), com tam, pad thai, and bun. It all tasted plain;the Pho was a little off, the pad thai wasn't spicy or had enough of the sweet/sour taste to it. The portions were really small. I definitely feel like my GPS lied to me and that I've experienced better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Every time we've been people have been friendly.  There's a camaraderie.  A Cheers-esque feeling if you will. Important in any neighborhood bar.  \nI've sampled the fish and chips and Shepard's pie and have not been disappointed.  Service has been good, quick and efficient. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My only regret with this place is that I worked neaby for years without knowing it was there!  I'm a vegetarian and I love the variety with the wraps, the soup and the sides.  I've tried many different wraps and each one was great! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I unfortunately had the same experience as the other reviewer, I bought flowers for my wife and they died within a day or two.  Scary how similar my experience with the staff was.  They were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers.  I definitely will not do business with them again.  Thomas H and Aurora E posted on the same day right after the \""owners\"" response using very similar language and typing skills; i.e. using caps for a number of words and the poor grammar is the same.  That is a little suspect but I know it happens on yelp.  It's rather sad this company has to stoop to such low levels.  You would think they would just apologize and want to offer good customer service instead of quoting policy over and over.  In the \""owners\"" 357 word response, not a single \""sorry\"" or \""we will do better\"" or \""we will make it right\"" comment.  Nothing but a long winded explanation about what their policy is and why they are like Macy's (ironic that Macy's actually has amazing customer service and would probably be upset knowing this flower shop is comparing their lack of customer service to Macy's).  I think that is very telling about the owner's and staff at this shop.\n\nI love supporting local business, but not ones that act like you should be thankful for doing business with them, it should be the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here for a friends birthday. They have a nice outside patio. That you can reserve. Great options for sandwiches & wine. I absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams, sauces, teas & cookwares. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. \n\nI'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. \n\nSo we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!\n\nSo I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. \""What the hell....\"" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just don't.\n\nMy review is really more about this TYPE of shop, and since this is the only one I went to, I don't have anything to base my comparison on.  \n\nMy first gripe is that I don't feel like I was given much attention since I was only looking for a single bridesmaid dress (to wear as my wedding dress.)\n\nMy second gripe is that if you're not a size 6 don't expect to try anything on.  I'm sorry, but I have a problem with waiting weeks for a dress I don't even know if I'm going to like when I put it on.  Maybe that's normal for bridal shops, and if that's the case, then I guess I hate bridal shops in general.\n\nAnd lastly, if they're going to act like a fancy, expensive store, then someone needs to tell them that headsets aren't fancy, and neither is their decor.\n\nThey did have lots of dresses, though.  If you're looking for something you've seen in one of those wedding magazines, and your taste isn't too unusual, you can probably find it here.  If you don't mind not being able to try it on, and purchasing from people who think more highly of themselves than they should, then go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. \n\nI REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. \n\nThis is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.  I'll be back soon just to visit these areas.   \n\nWe started with a nice bottle of french wine.\n\nFor the appetizer:\n\nBrie en Croute\nCreamy Brie coated with toasted almond slivers and\nwrapped in puff pastry, then baked, served with toasted\nbaguettes and port reduction \n\nThe main courses:\n\nPoitrine de Porc Provencale\nPan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provence\nand served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritters,\nsauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondue\n\nAnd...\n\nCoquille Saint-Jacques a la Sophie\nPan seared Sea Scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchi\nwith a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula salad\nfinished with tarragon beurre blanc\n\nFor Desert:\n\nRaspberry Brulee\nChambord soaked fresh raspberry\ninfused in vanilla creme brulee\n\n----- I need to get creative and come up with more birthday's, anniversary's, holidays, or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \n\nWhat an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tasty donuts in a convenient location. I've had their coffee rolls and other regular donuts and all of them are good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pad Thai with chicken, to go.  It's all I ever order.  Problems solved.  \n\nThough I did get a bum wrap-job once that led to an in-car calamity before going dancing and had the stench of spilled onion and chili on me all night.  Ah well.  It attracted the right people.  I could have had a Malaysian sugar daddy paying my innanet bills is all I'm sayin'.\n\nTheir service and friendliness have always sucked if you're not in some clique acknowledged by the staff.  I also don't like smelling like their fryer after spending an hour in the building.\n\nForget about Fate food on First Fridays, but definitely dance and kick it to the always-bangin' DJ Mendez on the patio (Nextdoor).\n\nPrices have gone up and portion sizes have gone down, but my picky executive chef Asian mother gave this place her late-night seal of approval and I just can't mess with that brilliance.\n\nI've been coming here since its grand opening some years ago and have DJed here on many a weekend night and First Friday; it's hard to reject a huge part of my Phoenix experience.  Like a good friend, I'll stick by it through the rough patches.  Unless it really fucks me over. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is horrible.  The service is very rude.  They refused to put letters on a shirt for me because I had my own letters, even though I would have paid for the service.  It was a really weird experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like this salon. They are reasonably priced, and the Spa Pedicure deal (it's on the wall) is a great package at a great price. It's very clean, too. My favorite techs are Lisa and Ann. \n\nBy the way, bring cash for the tip, otherwise you'll have to run next door to Fry's. They don't allow you to add tips to your total bill if you use a credit card. Merchant service fees can get expensive for merchants and they are probably just trying to keep their costs down. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm sitting here watching them NOT clean my cuticles after I asked them to redo it. Definitely won't be coming back here. How did this place get 4 stars?? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It had been a long while since we'd been to Outback so one weeknight recently craving steaks we returned.\n\nThe menu has changed (evolved?) since I was last there, more choices with steaks seasonings, expanded menu offerings, etc.  Frankly it was just confusing to me.  I just want the old Outback steak thank you.\n\nOrdered the 8oz sirlion & shrimp w/ the famous house salad and grilled asparagus (new item) for sides.  Well, the steak was pretty good and cooked as requested .  The 3 little shrimp were somewhat bland and did not excite, salad was skimpy from what I recalled from the past, and the grilled asparagus was Ewwwwh.  Asparagus looked like it had been waiting for my order and then reheated or regrilled.  Did I mention that our waiter assured me this was a very popular item receiving many rave reviews?? - oh, and I got to pay $1 upcharge for this little vegetable gem.  Tough stalks and had a smoky taste that didn't work either - I was NOT impressed.  Crazy perhaps that I am ranting about a vegetable but I was really looking forward to this item and Outback really blew it.\n\nService was mostly efficient although the waiter bordered on being hovering and too familiar.  Out of my face please I am trying to eat here.  \n\nOverall I have to say this was a disappointing experience.  Outback is not cheap by any means.  There are plenty of other better places to go for steak.  Outback would do well to return to what made them famous in the first place (it's the food, stupid).  Based on this experience, it will be a long while before I decide to go back to Outback. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This salad bar restaurant is okay. I can't even stress to people enough though that this is on the polar opposite end of Sweet Tomatoes both in quality of food and selection and they are about the same price. The selection here is a lot smaller and you can tell that the quality of produce isn't as high. Also, the bread selection looks like something that they just pulled out of the freezer. I will eat here on occasion with colleagues if we really want a salad bar lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've only been here for a Carolina - Dook basketball game, so I can't comment on the concert scene. And as for the basketball viewing, I was really impressed.\n\nEvery year for the last Carolina - Dook basketball game of the year, the Carolina Alumni holds the event at the Visulite. And don't worry, you don't have to be an alum, just a fan. On stage, they have a huge projection screen that shows the game & they play the game audio through the speakers. Not only is the place crammed with Carolina folks cheering away, they actually sell real Blue Cups from He's Not Here. For those of you who know what I'm talking about, you'll be freaking thrilled to get one where you least expected it.\n\nOne bit of advice though is to get there really early to wait in line. The gates open a good bit before the game, but people will be waiting in line to get the best seats. Your viewing can be hampered if you get there late, so just get there early.\n\nThe Visulite gives you a unique experience for watching the game, one you wouldn't think possible in the city of Charlotte. So get there early & remember to bring your cash for the Blue Cups! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Everytime I come here they seem to have less and less men's items, specifically designer jeans, which also seem to be getting more and more expensive. \nSelling stuff is a bit different here too. It's consignment so it doesn't quite work the same as Buffalo Exchange where you bring them stuff they take what they want and give you cash or credit on the spot.\nHere, they buy on consignment so they chose the items they want and you get money based on what they sell for AFTER they sell. And they have sales ALL the time it seems.\nLast time I went I sold them 4 pieces and went in today, 3 wks later and nothing sold.\nOf course nothing they took from me was out on the floor. I literally went through every piece. Nothing.\nSeems kinda shady. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a \""night out\"" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.\n\nTwo stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  you go there thinking you will get a good deal but believe me you can do better at Home Depot I bought 3 gas stoves for $349 each plus delivery found better ones at Home Depot for $329 I had already purchased the $349 so it was too late but guess what I'll be at home depot next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I cannot belive I have just found myself coming into this place.\nI have passed it many times through out the years. I cannot remember if it was always call Rainbow or not. But, I remember it being there.\nAnyway, it is colorfully painted ,so you will not miss it as you drive by.\n\nI was in charge of picking up some doughnuts for work. I almost forgot, so I was on my way to the job and saw the sign.\nWow, I was surprised how nice it was.\nSmelled like fresh baked goods inside.  They say they bake fresh doughnuts every day. I say they are better than Duncan!\n\nApple Fritter was fantastic. I got a dozen to go in a lovely pink box. As well as a couple of coffees. I was a popular guy that day.\nBy the way they even have breakfast and lunch food , not just baked goods.\nLook for the brightly colored building. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We selected this restaurant because we had a gift card to use for our date night and on a Friday, had about a 20 minute wait.  So far, so good.  \n\nOur waitress was really friendly, but not over the top and kept a check on us frequently. \n\nI had an Italian Mojito which I don't recommend, period...blech.  \n\nWe got the Zucchini Friti for an appetizer which was perfect and the dipping sauce was delish and the best part of our whole meal!  I got a salad with ranch dressing - it was fine...nothing special.  I ordered the Carmela's Chicken and it was bland, almost dry and overall just lacking.  I brought more home than I ate and reheated with some garlic sauce I had making it better than the original for lunch the next day.  I wouldn't get it again.  My husband got the steak and had fries that were better than the steak, which I thought was WAY undercooked, even for medium.  Blech!\n\nI would give our waitress an extra .5 half star or maybe even a star, but our food was definitely not over a two star this visit.\n\nGood thing we had a gift card.  We left a nice tip for our waitress with the balance since we had no plans of returning in the near future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came to this place after having no luck with English Hedgerow, searching for a potted flower for a balcony.  Considering I knew next to nothing about this, I needed some attention from a worker who could answer questions about durability and how to take care of the flowers I was looking at.  Immediately, a young lady came out and asked if she could help me, then proceeded to knowledgeably guide me to a potted azalea and a potted daisy.  I actually bought the daisy first, but right after going out, I decided I wanted the azalea, and she was quick to allow me the exchange (especially since the azalea was about twice the price).  Considering the flowers I got were VERY well received, I feel like this was an overall positive visit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have no idea why this place is so highly rated. In October 2012, I came to this establishment saw the doctor and received the prescription. I did not get my glasses right away because there was a mix up with my insurance and I would need to wait until January until my insurance reset. \n\nCome the new year I called the office to set up time to get my glasses. At this point Paradise Valley Eye Care had informed me they did not have my prescription on file because I saw Dr. Christiansen. Well come to find out the doctor had no record of my visit. It was not until April that they found my prescription and had it sent over. I went and ordered my glasses-finally there was light at the end of the tunnel! My appointment was for early June to order pick out my glasses. I was told my glasses would take 2-4 weeks to arrive. July comes around and I have yet to hear if my glasses had arrived. I called the office and they stated my glasses arrived three weeks ago. Assuming positive intent and the possibility the my cell phone did not receive the call, i let it go. I went in to try on my glasses and became incredibly sick due to the stigmitism. They said nothing could be done and I would need to see the doctor again to be re-examined. I had my appointment the next day and it was determined I would not need a prescription with stigmitism. Reordered my glasses and started to play the waiting game. \n\nAgain I was told it would take 2-4 weeks. 4 weeks had gone by and again I never heard about my glasses and had to call. Again I was told I was called 3 weeks ago and they had my glasses. I had them double check the number to make sure they were calling the right person, my information was correct. I arrived at the  Paradise Valley Eye Care, and the ladies at the front desk had informed me I must have been mistaken because they did not receive my glasses and did not give me a call. I reminded them that I called them and they told me the glasses were there. After more research the front desk had said that they had record of the glasses being received and even signed for them-but they could not find them. They offered to have me pick up a new pair of glasses and wait 2-4 weeks or go with the ones I had. I really liked the ones I picked out, so I decided to go with the glasses I had originally picked up. Again the same old story, I would need to wait 2-4 weeks and they would call me to pick up my glasses. As you can imagine the same situation occurred again, where they \""supposedly called me\"" and the glasses were there. \n\nNow on September 14th, I went in for hopefully the last time to get my glasses. Again tried on the glasses, and what do you know-they only removed the stigmatism from one of the lens. So I knew immediately when I started to get sick. Come to find out there were two prescriptions, one that showed no stigmatism and the other that showed one. Ironically they could fix this problem on the spot (It is my wonder why they did not do this the first time around)-Finally after almost a year of getting my initial eye exam, I have my set of glasses. \n\nNow Eric and some older women who would not give me her name (which I found really odd) were very sympathetic to my situation. They gave me a eye glass case, a pretty one. But truth be told after this ordeal I expected something more than a damn eye glass case. In summary this office is unorganized, unprofessional, horrible customer service and a place I highly recommend on not using. The office had several opportunities to show great customer service in all of my times that I went back to the office-but they severely failed every time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have recently reconsidered trying this place again which led me here after looking at their menu on their website, and I remembered why I have lived just a block away for seven years and have only been once. Way over-priced!!!! This place is trying to be something it is not. I'm sorry but it is more than olive garden and someone mentioned macaroni grill and pales in comparison. There is a reason that almost every single review on here mentions that they were either the only patrons in the place or close to it. I walked into this place seven years ago and looked at their menu prices and instead of just walking out, I ordered one kid's meal for my daughter-some spagetti noodles- It was subpar at best. And seven dollars for mac-n-cheese, that is outrageous! I have been many places and have ordered many kid's mac-n-cheese (it's all my daughter wants) and NEVER has it been seven dollars! It really is a shame, I drive passed this place every day going to Safeway and whatnot, and am always looking for a place to sit down with family and enjoy good food, without breaking the bank. The prices should reflect the food, the location, the atmosphere and decor, and the service. If it did, there would be people there eating, rather than a ghost town. Honestly, I am surprised it is still in business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain, they have always helped me out and been very nice. It does however take me awhile to get an appointment. Usually ranges between 7-10 business days. I have also never had anyone at my clinic ever pick up the phone. I have always left a message and they return it within 24-48 hours. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food, never had a bad meal there.  I love that they get their desserts from Signature Desserts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the only spot my man will get his hair cut!! The barbers are thorough, affordable, and trim his hair right every time; they even offer straight razor for face and eyebrow cleanup. Best spot in Phoenix for traditional men's grooming (plus the back massage takes it to the next level). Go there if you want efficient service and a barber who remembers what you like. Completely satisfied, every time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stopped by after a unexpected dental procedure for my wife as she wanted something soft to eat and pancakes filled the bill.  The food was O.K. but our server seemed more interested in us getting leaving.  She took our order and delievered our food with no problem, then she presented us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything more.  I was thinking about some desert, but with the \""hurry up and leave\"" attitude, I wasn't going to bother her.  The sad thing is, they were not busy and I would have thought that she'd been upselling everything so that she could increase her tip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sad. This used to be one of my favorite places. When we went to the new grand opening of Richardson's we were all so excited, but that soon faded with the horrible service, cramped eating areas, and food with no flavor other than hash or ancho chilies. I love chilies and I know that new mexican cuisine incorporates this ingredient a lot but that is all we tasted in all 4 of our different dishes. The cooks need to learn about portion control and tasting before serving. Very disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 4-stars because it is really easy to get in and out of the airport without a lot of walking or long lines if you're a smoker and have some time between flights.\n\nI was really intrigued by the woman at the TSA checkpoint, who was reciting all sorts of travel tips in a TV Voice, but with no expression on her face.  She was really kind of amazing, and the contrast of her facial expression and her voice actually made me listen.\n\nNot many food choices, though...a couple more restaurants would be nice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hey Yelpers  stay away from hooters downtown, the service is poor and the food is worse. They treat u very poorly and when u ask management if they can resolve an issue they belittle u and tell u to leave. Never will I go to hooters again, will let family and friends know about the terrible experience I received. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very frustrating experience.\n\nI came here to get my passport photo done. I walked up to the counter that had a giant overhead sign that said, \""PHOTO\"" on it. I waited for 10 minutes as I watched cashiers and the manager chit-chatting behind the counter. I kept smiling, but they just looked away. Talking about whatever they did over the weekend was much more important. Finally, I had to say, \""Excuse me?!\"" rather loudly because of the volume of their conversation. The manager turned my way and said, \""Oh! Has anyone helped you?\"".\n\nFast-forward a couple minutes. The manager didn't know how to properly take the photo. She didn't tell me when she was taking it, and when I requested to see the photos she said, \""Oh. I already printed one.\"" She made me wait then gave them to me, told me to go to the cashier's counter, and walked off.\n\nMy photo looks incredibly pissed off. Hopefully the consulate won't reject my Visa based on how angry I look, haha.\n\nOverall, annoying experience. I won't be using this CVS Pharmacy again (unless, of course, there is an apocalypse). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yes, I'm spoiled.  I grew up in Denver and enjoyed DIA--the most pristine airport you will ever visit--for the majority of my life.  In comparison, Sky Harbor is just another run-of-the-mill airport.  \n\nThe food sucks.  One time before a flight I had a teriyaki chicken bowl at one of the generic restaurants (I decided this would be one of the most healthy options aside from Quiznos--too many delicious dipping sauces...).  I must not have been thinking about the effects of eating a dish with an astronomical amount of sodium, because my feet swelled so much that I had to remove my shoes during the flight.  Lovely.  \n\nParking is a nightmare.  There is no logic the parking garage.  It corkscrews you up and you're suddenly on level 6, without a hint as to the location of the terminal's entrance.  When I flew back home from my trip, I went out to the parking garage to find my car, only to realize that I was in the wrong terminal.  If you're flying on different airlines in and out of Sky Harbor, make note of the terminal where your car is parked!  \n\nOne must take a shuttle between terminals to get between them.  Never fun after a day of traveling.\n\nI thought it would be relatively painless to simply pick someone up or drop them off here.  What a nightmare.  Especially when you have to reach terminal 2.  \n\nBeware: terminal 2 has no clearly marked signs for passenger drop off.  I had to circle around and almost ended up back on the 202, all while dodging the rude taxi and shuttle drivers that LOVE to cut me off.  Disastrous when your precious cargo is about to miss their flight.    \n\nThe signs to get back on the 202 aren't very clear either.  I need arrows.  I need signs that say \""left lane 202 E\""  or \""right lane 202 W\"" (disclaimer:  I have no clue if the right or left lane take you east or west).  How in the world they twist you around each side of every terminal and loop you through to the highway, I have no clue.  \n\nObviously, I don't enjoy coming here.  But the hope of enjoying my destination city keeps me coming back.  Plus, I have no other choice.  Unless I buy my own jet.  Even then I will probably still have to deal with the crazy taxi drivers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The only reason I've ever been to this hell hole is because I knew someone who worked there. You can see overweight sorority girls clumsily swinging around the \""poles\"" in the back bar while attempting to get the attention of one of the bartenders and dodge the puke on the floor.\n\nOne good thing is that the drinks are RIDICULOUSLY cheap. shots are $2, pitchers can be as low as $4. I would imagine that if you went there in the afternoon you could have an enjoyable happy hour on the patio, but don't go anywhere near this place after 10. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So I've been going to this place for a couple of years now.  But lately, every time I pull in I'm met with a full parking lot thanks to the tavern next door.  I'm not going to play the valet parking game when all I want to do is see my barber.  I just want to get my hair cut and be on my way, you know?\n\nUpdate: I value the service enough that I arranged to be dropped and picked up today.  Good haircut.  However, I would prefer that my barber not try to involve me in gay-bashing.  Talk of how gays must \""f*** in private in Russia\"" but how they just do in the open here in America and how they are a bad role model for children is not appropriate conversation.  Believe what you want, just don't ask me to agree with you when I just want a damn haircut. Seriously, wtf? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When my friend and I walked in, we were immediately greeted by several people. Everyone was smiling and nice, and we were given a table outside. The waitress said she could tell our chairs were uncomfortable, so she switched them for better seats. I had the beef ribs and chicken breast quarter, with yams and macaroni and cheese. The ribs were different than I typically like (vinegary maybe) and the chicken was a little dry, but I loved how it wasn't overly salty like southern food sometimes is. The cornbread was good, but not as sweet as I like. The peach cobbler was different, but good. I got it to go and forgot it in my car so I didn't eat much. It was a good lunch with beautiful weather, so I'd go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a great spot to hang out with family and friends. I mostly come for the sincere service and the crazy karaoke nights. But I just found out last weekend there isn't anymore Karaoke by the wonderful host Stew. They are in need of someone ASAP. My father in law is a big fan of singing every Saturday but that won't keep us out. It's kid friendly and even a nice girls night out. This location does get a little busy I did notice that the soap was out and they didn't have papertowels but that just shows how popular this place is and one of the waitresses got to it right away.  I love that 2 for $20 and $24 can't believe it even includes an appetizer. This time I treated myself to their shrimp plate and picked my favorite sides of a perfect portioned fruit bowl and a warm scoop of mashed potatoes. I thought I'd actually get to have leftovers but I devoured the whole meal and had a little of everyone else's mouth watering meals. Having a group of people around definitely benefits you because each meal gets better and better. Too bad we were all too full for all their delicious desserts I'll definitely be back for that Maple Butter Blondie <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were the only people in the entire place. Service was okay, I'm pretty sure he was the owner. The food was decent, but the hookah was overpriced. The decor was unusual and everything could have used a good cleaning and a coat of paint. I won't be back to Kabob House. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They need to fire that bitch Ashleigh. ...I did not tip you today because of the stuck up bitch attitude you had with me & with the mother and her sons before me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My less than stellar review is for service.   We waited 30 minutes for our meals to be delivered.  When we questioned the waiter, he was not helpful, so we asked to speak to the manager.  The manager did not even come to speak with us!   We were loyal neighborhood customers, even walking to the restaurant frequently!   My husband then wrote an email to the owner, and it was ignored by him as well.   This is obviously a business that does not value customer service, we were very disappointed and Eastwind has lost regular customers <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much. \n\nWe called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave. \n\nI have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could. Had the hostess we'd spoken to earlier in the day not said it wouldn't be a problem, we would have made other arrangements for dinner that night. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the go-to cafe in Mt. Lebanon nowadays. There's plenty of room and the space is welcoming. \n\nThe coffee is terrific and the barista welcomes and chats with customers. The pastries and sweets are always evolving, so every time you visit there will be something new to try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is expensive.  Really expensive.  Expect everything thing here to be \""boutique\"" quality and that means you're going to pay out the nose.  $80/lb of chocolate.  $12 snacks.  $6 coffee.\n\nNow if you ignore price, it's a nice place.  Its sanitation rating was not nearly as high as I thought an upscale place would be (92) and it was a little bit less organized than I imagined, I guess to maintain that \""boutique\"" feel.\n\nIt's also one of the only places that you can buy Christopher Elbow chocolates in North Carolina. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Really bland tasting food, and annoying atmosphere, as well as annoying staff. The food has nothing unique about it. I wish the fries were good so \""bottomless fries\"" meant something to me. The table we sat at was REALLY close to another table (there is a row of crammed tables) and the people next to us were eavesdropping the entire time. Quite uncomfortable, but the only seating available. They brought out an entirely wrong burger to me, but gave me a $20 giftcard since they messed up, so that was cool. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Okay. I love chili's and my family always loved doing a quick chili's to go order for Friday dinner. Since moving with my fiance to this location, I haven't had that experience! Tonight we ordered 2 buffalo chicken sangwiches. Simple! We get home and we have breaded chicken sangwiches with mayo.....okay. the rest of the order is fine so I call back and re ordered. My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else. \n\nThese guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes. \n\nOh and the fries were cold both times. Like not even \""to go\"" cooled...we live 3 blocks from the place! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I struck gold...twice!\n\nAre you one of those people who has a fear of the dentist's chair? Well, this is the place for you!\n\nI'm originally from out of state and refused to see a local dentist, opting to wait for visits \""back home\"" where I could be seen by my favorite dentist to whom I've been very loyal. He was very skilled and we had a great rapport.\n\nThe day finally came when I couldn't wait for that trip back home due to the lifetime supply of plaque in my teeth. A friend recommended Dr. Choules' office because  of the reputation for getting patients out of the chair in time to get to work early in the morning. I had no idea what I'd also find was skilled, friendly, personable service to rival what I left behind back home.\n\nEveryone --- from the front office to the hygienists to the dentists --- have provided professional, sensitive service with a smile. Melissa, in particular, has been a joy to have as my hygienist. We never seem to lack for things to chat about --- which is a challenge when you're having your teeth cleaned! You'll never feel nervous or uncomfortable in her care. She's the most thoughtful, gentle and considerate hygienist anyone could ask for. I hope someone's reading this and giving her a big, fat raise!\n\nSo, if you're shopping around for dental care, do yourself a favor and make an appointment here. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and the $50 take home bleaching kit offer with a Yelp check in can't be beat! :D <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wonderful (WONDER-FULL!) place for kids and adults alike. I don't mind paying full/adult admission for this place as there is just as much to do/learn/experience as with the child's experience.\n\nI'm so glad I waited to review this place until today (we went Friday, July 13th) because I remember my husband and I thinking  that, aside from the wonderful Body Works and Grossology temporary exhibits, some major improvements, additions and renovations were in order... And I was SO impressed with all the nice changes since we last visited with our kids (then age 3 and 7; now 6 and 10) a few years ago. \n\nONE CAVEAT: If you live in the Phoenix Area, definitely opt for the membership, as just TWO VISITS make it worth the cost. (3 or 4 visits, which is completely reasonable just for the summertime will make the price even more attractive).\nAnother complaint I have is the check-in time for non-members (20 minutes on line just to step up to a cashier; all the while my kids had to endure the taunting view of the outdoor water/balls exhibit and I had to subsequently endure, \""Why is it taking so long?!\"").\n\nOther than that, this place ROCKS!\nWe look forward to going back and buying the family membership! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tried to use a BOGO coupon and they \""didn't know how to do it\""........ Manager couldn't help either. The girls working there are less than stellar to be there and it shows. I think I have yet to find a decent sally's beauty in phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I honestly wish I can give this place no stars. Okay, okay. It's a mcdonalds, nothing to rave about but the fact that they have the *excuse my language* SHITTEST customer service erks me. I use to go here often because I went to CPCC harris campus. 8/10 times they would get my order wrong somehow but that's not the point. The thing that annoys me is how one worker tried to blame ME for the wrong order. Seriously.. this mcdonalds needs to get their shit together. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Another Groupon Now Deal...I'm starting to see a trend with these...mediocre food.  I had the red beans and rice which came out warm...not hot.  My husband ordered the spicy fried chicken which was VERY crispy and the brown meat was tender and juice.  The breast, however, was dry and flavorless and needed to be brined before frying just to give it something.  I won't return.  I was barely worth the \""deal\"" but I'm glad I tried it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They charged me $512 for a single visit with 2 rabbits WITHOUT ANY HEADS-UP - and they most definitely did NOT provide $512 worth of services. I was sick to my stomach when I left. VCA Fox Chapel is a rip off and they provide a disservice to animals and pet owners. \n\nAfter seeing the breakdown of the bill, I could't believe how much they charged. The one rabbit is (per statement vet) not going to get better. Yet, he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs. He also drew blood from the other bunny and yelled similar codes to the back. Turns out each of these \""codes\"" he yelled back was a blood test for which they charged about $60 a piece. The one bunny also got 2 injections: 0.3 ml of PenG was $41.72 (mind the fact that I have this bottle of PenG at home because the vet put the other bunny on this medication weeks ago, so he should/ could have remembered that and just let me give the injection at home if that's what they charge for this! And the whole 100 ml bottle was about $8 at the store) and 0.1 ml (yes, a tiny tiny amount) of Metacam for $43.34. The base consultation is $77 for a bunny. \n\nThe office manager later told me that I should have just asked about costs during the visit (and kindly offered to put a note on my file that I am a customer who would like to be informed about costs (of course, there will be no next time)). When I explained that I feel that the vet has a responsibility to keep a pet owner posted when he is about to rack up a hefty bill with a bunch of tests, she said that the vet just wanted to be thorough. I think that the vet or the vet tech knew exactly what kind of charges they were incurring and I am so mad and disappointed that they abused the situation. \nWhen the check-out lady saw how flabbergasted I was, she asked if I told the vet I had money trouble. Money trouble? Because I'm not prepared to pay $512 for a single visit? All I can do at this point is warn other people not to go to the Fox Chapel VCA... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been taking my vehicles to Bill Conian and 25th St Auto for about 20 years and have ALWAYS been very pleased with both the service to my car and with the customer service. In this crazy age of almost NO customer service, Bill shines brightly  as a beacon of care and competence. It is such a relief to have a business I can completely trust and one that seems genuinely appreciative to have my \nbusiness. I recommend 25th St without reservation. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Top Tier Thai.  Best Green Curry in the city.\n\nWe've been there twice, once for lunch, and once for dinner.  Both were great, with nice service, and excellent food.  \n\nThe big hit the first time was the Tofu Green Curry.  Every restaurant in the city that has a \""Vegetarian Option\"" on the menu needs to go here and try this dish.  It is so good, with each ingredient having its own place in the dish.  Not just a mash of veggies in a thick green curry.  Truly one of the best curries I've ever had.  It makes a dish that has become boring in most other places truly exciting.  We had it again the second time and it was exceptional again.\n\nOur second dish was a whole spicy fish, which was also very good, and a nice compliment to the curry.  First time, at lunch, I think I had a shrimp prik pow, and that was also very nice.\n\nThe Ginger Tea is also great.  \n\nAs we were finishing dinner last time, I commented that the curry is so good that next time we'd have to try the Pad Thai.  That's a dish we hardly ever get when its just the two of us, because it can be a bit generic, a safe choice for those that don't know or really like Thai food.  But it IS the national dish of a truly world-class cuisine, and given what they do with the green curry, we thought, \""I bet it's really something special\""\n\nAs we were leaving, the owner thanked us for coming, and as we discussed the meal a bit she said \""Oh, you have to try the Pad Thai!  The best in the city!\""  I bet that's true, and can't wait to have another dish that's usually a bit of a yawn, turn out to be a real surprise in the hands of this great Thai restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm sorry, but I have to say I am not impressed with the AZ Science Center. I bought a family membership, which was pretty expensive, we visited a couple of times, and that was plenty. The exhibits are always the same and kind of boring, except for whatever traveling exhibit they may have, and that costs extra on top of your membership! And I was not at all impressed with the Ripley's exhibit. I can honestly say Ripley's was a rip. Last time we were there, some of the cooler things were broken (like the little bike that goes around in a circle).\n\nOverall, it's probably fine for a one-time visit, but I wouldn't waste money on a membership. It gets old fast. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In a pinch, I had to find a place for lunch that was downtown, not overly expensive, and served both delicious soup and salad. A coworker suggested the Coronado Cafe, so I looked up the menu and happily discovered that it more than met my criteria. \n\nFor lunch, I had half of the Turkey sandwich and a small Coronado Gorgonzola salad. YUMMMM!!! The Turkey sandwich has a sort of cranberry relish instead of mayo (much healthier and much more delicious), and the Gorgonzola salad had apple slices and candied walnuts. It was the exact meal I was in the mood for. \n\nThe restaurant itself is almost too cute for it's own good. It's small, cozy and the absolute polar opposite of any chain restaurant. The service was great, and my food arrived quickly. I can't wait to eat here again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Service was excellent! There girls work together so well and is like a welcome committee to the city!! Parking was a bit tricky because of some construction in the square, cool area tho.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am a sucker for antiques and historic anything - one night after a heavy boozing session in downtown Phoenix, I decided that rather than risking a DUI or calling a friend to babysit, that I would find the most affordable hotel that wasn't a shit hole. Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10\"" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense. \n\nOther than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. I hear the pool is rad, and how can it not be when Marilyn Monroe herself took a dip in it once upon a time? Other celebs have shacked up here as well.. Mae West, Jack Dempsey, John F. Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well? Maybe I did experience a little paranormal activity, without even knowing it!\n\nI will certainly be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My friend and I went there last night and it was so good I can't stop thinking about it.  Even if I could stop thinking about that dinner, I'll be reminded of it every time I check my bank account balance because Umi must be the Japanese word for \""you think you can afford this, but you cannot.\""\n\nI will absolutely dine at Umi again.\n\nI wish I'd ordered the Omakase, which is $85 but provides a sampling of everything and from the other reviews here it looks like a lot of people recommend it.  I advise ordering the Omakase because while $85 seems pricey, you're bil is going to be close that anyway.\n\nI know I keep talking about money and it makes me sound like a peasant, but having abject sticker shock at the end of any dining experience is never fun.\n\nIt was, however, worth it.  My friend and I ordered a bunch of different things and everything was EXCELLENT!\n\nWe had:\n\nvegetable tempura\nmiso soup\nwhite tuna sashimi which basically melts in your mouth\ntuna tataki\nsalmon with mushroom sashimi\nsawara w garlic ponzu which was good but we found the garlic a little overwhelming\ncalifornia rolls\ntuna and cucumber rolls\nspicy tuna rolls\nat least 4 carafs of sake\n\nI highly recommend this place, this would be a good place to go on a date if you aren't paying or if you are traveling with a corporate credit card.  \n\nMAKE RESERVATIONS.  We were there on a Wednesday and the guy who answered the phone to take my reservation acted like he was doing me a favor to fit me in.  It was a little crowded, but we were able to sit at a tatami table.\n\nPro tip:  Wear pants.  A family w kids sat at the tatami table across from us and it was a bitch to get out of the tatami table while wearing a maxi dress without flashing everyone. Which is impressive since it was a long skirt.\n\nIn summary:  Go to Umi, but only if you aren't paying.  Trust your servers recommendations, and get the Salmon & Mushroom sashimi <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term \""egg\"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Unfortunately, I live near Eastland Mall. The place is in shambles, and while I like the prices at some of the ghetto-tastic clothing stores enough that I sometimes venture in there, I've mostly stopped going all together. I tried to use the Radio Shack in this mall to get help with my Sprint Cell phone, and the music in the store was so loud I couldn't get the staff to hear me. The guy behind the desk, who I later discovered was a manager, acted as if I were disturbing him.\n\nI've gotten my eyebrows waxed at Foxy Nails, and the price was right...but again, the service was a little lacking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Enterprise. First time because AMEX for whatever reason didn't book National this time. They even told me it was the same company which is clearly not the case.\n\nArriving, the guy propose me all the insurance that I have to take. It increases the price of the renting by 3... (400$ to +1200$) So from cheap prices AMEX told me, I got a 3 times higher bill now.\n\nNot that I am not aware of this kind of situation but in the case of Enterprise, there will be a difference when you arrive to the car. National use to give for the same price a middle to full car size. Enterprise will just give you a small car you \""asked\"" for for the small price which is now with the insurance a full size car price.\n\nWe also wanted to change the credit card used to pay. Call Enterprise desk put on hold forever. Send an e-mail to the leasing agent that gave me his card, never got an answer.\n\nThe car didn't have any problem. Only positive thing.\n\nSo for resume:\nFor the National price, you get at Enterprise a small car with no people willing to help you once you swiped your credit card. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Recommended by a co-worker, and out looking for some grub I decided it was worth a shot.  Definitely a dive as described, but reasonably full so I stayed.  The service was a little slow, and the food kind of blah, but the cheese wineburger was decent if bland.  The chili cheese fries came out on a huge plate and the fries were not great, the chili tasted like it came from a can, but the cheese and onions were real and fresh.  I didn't realize it was RC Cola, which I did not enjoy, but the price was good and it was an interesting place to sit and people watch.\n\n/overheard \""I don't do anything downstairs!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Literally \""As good as it gets\""!!  Everything was top notch!  \n\nGreat beer selection; I had a French Kronenbourg, which I can't recall seeing in the US recently.  We split the spinach dip (on a recommendation from my other half's friend) -- amazing. I had the \""Nice Little House Salad\"" (which, by the way, is not named after the French city of Nice, rather the English adjective, which proved true) -- extremely fresh, tasty and very generous with the goat and heirloom beets.  Enjoyed THE BEST rib eye I've ever consumed!  Flawlessly prepared and 1000% tasty!  I got a loaded baked potato for my side and I also ate my partner's cole slaw, which was creamy and horeradishy and supremely delicious!  \n\nThe ambiance; amazing.   The service; flawless.  The food; divine!  It's a tad pricey for a weekly dinner stop, but worth every single penny of it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been a resident of this \""beautiful\"" community for three years.  Three years too many.  I have dealt with several unbecoming situations in this complex including a used condom taped to my door, a combative leasing staff, being walked in on naked by contractors this company has hired.  Dirty grounds over run with stray cats and cigarette butts.  Save yourself the application fee and RUN!!!  This place is horrible and I can't wait until my lease is up so I can be done with this living hell.  I have been startled awake many times in the night having to call the police due to domestic violence issues.  So much, so that the police dispatcher knows my voice!  Management gave a \""devil may care\"" attitude regarding such a dangerous situation.  For your safety and health, DO NOT RENT HERE!  DO NOT MAKE THESE PEOPLE ANY RICHER!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I never thought any fast food (outside of In N Out) would get more than 4 stars. Besides the fact that their food tastes like roadkill, I'm still amazed. Only in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really nice tex-mex.  Inside looked very nice, and I'm sure the natives flock to the AC, but as tourists, of course, we sat outside.  Remarkable homemade chips, some corn, some sweet potato, some something else, all very good.  Salsa was a bit on the tomatoe side for my taste, but good nonetheless.  The approach is a bit off-putting since it's upstairs fo a mall, but once inside it's just classy tex-mex and a step above avegare at that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of \""Real Italian Food\"" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately, I was let down. There is nothing authentically Italian about this eatery. Staff was upbeat and nice , pizza buffet was sparse and pizza looked old. It was right around dinner time , so if anything, that's when the buffet should  be stocked with choices.  We ordered a pizza with meatball and pepperoni, and a side of mozzarella sticks. Sauce was decent and sticks were good, toppings were fresh. It's convenient, if you live in the area, but I don't understand all the hype. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The fried catfish was perfect.  The sides were good too.  the service was good and the people friendly.  Good place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went Saturday night for drinks and dessert since Franco's Cafe is closed on vacation. We had Tiramisu, it was small to share but very good. The espresso is very well made, short pour with the creme' on top, so made just like in Italy, perfection! We both had a cocktail. I can't remember what my husband had and I had the chocolate.tini We both had the same reaction about the drinks good but we weren't wow'ed and they both were little smaller than we expected for the price. The singer was great and a nice addition to the evening. My husband appreciated that they allowed him to sit outside at  the farthest table from the entrance so he could have a cigar, so I'm sure we will be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is an interesting property that is attempting to be nice in an area that is a mixed bag of new/old/and just plain worn out.  The hotel is attempting to remodel and is doing a fair job at it.  The furniture is new, beds new and bathrooms remodeled.  There is a no smoking policy, but the lobby smells like smoke and the manager who talks about the non-smoking policy smells like a giant cigarette.  \n\nThe part where this goes bad is the management.  The main manager does not deal well with the public and I'm really not sure how this place is still in business with him running it.  \n\nPay the extra $40 (I did) and stay at the Marriott (Springhill Suites) one block west on Van Buren.  Quiet, clean, big rooms, hot tub, friendly staff, big breakfast, store on site so you don't have to cross Van Buren and worry about the sketchy Circle K across the street.  I do not recommend this NOT-SUPER 8 motel. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've gone to this location before several times and was satisfied with customer service and how my car looked every time; however, today was different.  I went in to get a regular car wash and vacuum, but was talked into getting a full car detail.  Which in actuality I was fine with since my car was in need of some tlc.  When I asked how long it would take to be done I was told 45 minutes to an hour.  I paid the cashier at 2:28.  At 3:30 I started to get antsy and at 4:35 when my car still was not done I was so over it.  My car was finally done at 4:45.  The car looked great and they really put in work on it, but if you're going to tell a customer that a service will be done by a certain time it should be done by a certain time.  When I explained my issue to employees one said \""that sucks\"" and the other said that they shouldn't have quoted that time, but there was no effort made to try to make up for my experience.  Not even an apology.  Even a little sympathy would have been nice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Drove all the way here for what was supposed to be killer food and dessert.\n\nWhat we got was the following.\n\nATTITUDE!\n\nSorry but when you go out to dinner you shouldn't have to deal with attitude having wait staff and managers.\n\nThe pizza was very very average, maybe they had an off night?\n\nThe desserts were all fantastic. Although we couldn't order them with our meal the way we were told we could in the bakery area. So we had to finish up, pay and then go back to the bakery area to buy desserts.\n\nThe good: Salt on the tables is a very good salt and as a chef myself I appreciate that.\nThe desserts are top shelf. Artichoke heart dish was interestingly yummy.\n\nThe bad: Service was horrible. Manager was rude. Pizza was decent at best. \n\nWill probably stop in for desserts if ever in the area but would'nt step foot in the restaurant side again unless it was free. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fun, Festive, Inexpensive, Selection, Culture, Taste, Energetic....\n\nThe Ranch is a great place, but be prepared for crowds, I don't know of a time we have been there that it hasn't been busy, but Christmas time ... Ay Carumba!  The produce, the meats, the Cocina, the Bakery, the selection is all amazing... even if you don't live close, bring a cooler with some ice in your car to get what you want/need and then feel better about taking it home!  \n\nBe sure to try their resturant (on West end of the building) Tradiciones! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food and great staff! Our waitress was awesome, checked in when we needed her but didnt hound the table. The manager and gm checked with us as well. I reccomend the bacon cheddar mashed potatoes! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ahhh... Apollos.... \n\nThe little gay bay down the street... Apollos has evolved over the years... I've had some good times here... and now that their makeover is almost complete ( bathrooms to be renovated soon I understand...SOON I hope! ).. I might be going back more often. \n\nThe surly bartenders have long been replaced and a huge patio constructed... although I no longer smoke, its an enjoyable area. \n\nAlthough its not my first choice of bars, I stop by from time to time to enjoy a \""well made\"" (read: strong) cocktail, and catch up with buds. The best nights (my opinion) are Karaoke nites, when the place normally packs with a very diverse crowd. \n\nAside from my issues with the men's bathroom... (only the padlocks were worse) and the overly bright lighting, this bar is getting better! After chatting with the owner ...Its great to know that they are \""in touch\"" with their patrons and will quickly address any issues! \n\nI'm really looking forward to the completion of the renovations! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I frequent this place pretty often. The food is always delicious and fresh. I love the crab ragoons! Best I have tasted! Staff is always friendly and service is nothing to complain about. We always get a friendly, \""come spend your money with us\"" smile and greeting every time we come, which is wonderful in today's society. Considering the fact that some businesses feel they don't have to appeal to, or make any effort to earn your business. The watermelon is really sweet and delicious too! Health/Sanitation grade was 98.5. Enjoy! I always do! OMG! I almost forgot,  the Sake is the bomb.com! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Let's be real. Its Boston Market. They aren't reinventing the wheel.  But the food came out hot and fresh tasting. And the service was super friendly.  Theresa anticipated my needs and the line worked fast.  If anything, I'd come back here for the service and its clean. Those two things alone make it 4 stars when compared to other fast casuals. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think this guy has let his 15 min of fame go to his head. Came here last week with a couple girlfriends for dinner,  The price we paid for just OK bland and flavorless food, cheep wine with a three times the price  price tag, and the luxury to sit on flimsy outdoor chairs, rolled in a napkin silverware and the best yet, plastic water cups was mind blowing. I felt like our waiter was up selling us the whole time and the hovering cocky owner was annoying at best. and lets talk about the \"" As seen on food network\"" sign hanging over the door and the diner guys pic hanging ever where, way overkill there. also what happened to a basket of free bread, come on $3 for bread are you kidding me. Whatever this place can suck it I wont be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Will never be back and will tell everyone I know how terrible and unsafe this place is! Today at 2 pm, John at the beginning of the line took forever to get to me - checking in 3 other people who arrived after me.  Then he asks if I wand the floors and mats cleaned and I said yes if it was fast - I asked him 3 times and told him very clearly that it had to be done fast since I had another appointment.  \""Yes, yes, fast, I know\"" is what he said.  50 minutes later I asked another guy to check on my car and he comes back to tell me it will be another 45 minutes!  That guy was really nice but I was now very late for another appointment.  I watched 3 of them gather at my car, stop work and just start talking.  I waited 7 minutes to see if they would start again and finally walked over to the car to see what was going on.  Those folks were very nice but then John walked up and told me that it was my fault because my carpets were so dirty and that he never made any promises to me.  I disagreed and did raise my voice, but never yelled, when I said, \""oh so this is my fault?\"" He immediately took a step closer, got in my face screaming at me not to yell at him and that I \""disrespected\"" him all while pointing his finger less than inch from my face. I told him, very quietly and very sternly to \""Walk away John, Walk away now\"" and he just kept going, backing me up until another very nice worker stepped in and had to physically push him away from me. FYI, I am a woman and I was alone today.  I can't remember the nice guy's name as I was pretty shaken at this point but he had a black bow tie on and he was great, apologizing and trying to make it right.  I told him that at this point i didn't feel safe staying there and to just give me my car.  It took forever since their spin dryer for the mats wasn't working and I drove home with sopping wet mats in the back of my car and quite upset.  I'm still upset and am considering filing a report with the police.  There were dozens of witnesses and one customer even stopped to give me his business card telling me to share his info if I decided to file a report.  And as for the rest of it, there were spots all over my car, 2 windows not cleaned and more crap work.  The store was a trash heap - empty racks, dirty floor, etc.  Disgusting all the way around.  If you value your safety, stay away or don't dare complain. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A great salsa dancing club in the evening hours!  I've never been here for lunch, but the atmosphere is great in the evening.  $5 to get in and then salsa dancing all night!  There's a full bar if you get thirsty and two dance floors. \n\nSalsa music is played and danced to--a welcome alternative to college kids bumping and grinding while sloshing cheap beer over the rims of cans.  Even if you don't know how to salsa come on by; you might meet someone who will teach you!\n\nI will certainly try out lunch here at some point.  In the meantime, check it out on a Friday or a Saturday night! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Gyros, tzatziki, fries, and friendly cooks and cashiers make this place a must-go.  My parents graduated from the U of I in 1981, and Zorba's was there back then!  Considering the relatively high turnover rate of Campustown restaurants, I think that's pretty impressive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is great if you hate things that get all assertive with your taste buds!\n\nI really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland.  Maybe if they spent some money on a recipe book instead of a graphic design campaign, they'd do a little better.\n\nThe fact that it won something from the New Times proves how corrupt that process is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been going to the Paisley Violin for years, since it was on Roosevelt. It has always been a neighborhood favorite.\nEverything is fresh, homemade and delicious. From the daily soups to the sandwiches, the coffee and espresso, you can't go wrong.\nThe service is always great, everyone is warm and wonderful.\nDon't be shy about the area, despite what you may think or hear, it is a nice neighborhood (I live blocks away) and things are changing fast. \nAnd it is always great to patronize a wonderful, independent neighborhood business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has really gone downhill in the last few years. \n\nWhen I first moved to the area it seemed like a cool place to go to. Lately the prices for their events have really gone up, the entertainment is trying to be shocking (but lame) and it just is starting to get sticky. The crowd thinks they are artsy but it is more like a half-assed S+M club in someones back yard. \n\nAfter going here about 15 times since 2004 I do not think I will go back. \n\noh and be careful about where you park. The neighborhood has gotten shady. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get \"" medium bone out \""? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies \""I guess some one else got your wings\"". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Incredibly disappointing! I think that this was the worst decision I made for our wedding. She didn't provide enough flowers and yet her quote increased at the wedding, and though the ballroom looked nice, the rest of the ceremony and event looked cheap and/or empty and/or full of glitches (thing falling apart, things left fallen by the alter..etc). She's nice but for the price we paid, we were so disappointed. I've just spent a lot of time in the floral industry lately and realize now how much beauty and care could have gone into this event but didnt. For what we paid, I've seen stunning weddings with lush florals and it saddens me when I think about what we got. Honestly, three years later, I still feel disappointed in the wedding flowers she provided. I would not recommend her. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dear Pizza Hut,  your dough is just horrible please take a page from Dominos and scrap what you're doing and get back in the game.   Tonight's pizza was just a mess.   Half went to the trash.   And that's only because we were so disgusted that we shared it with a less discriminating friend.  I can't believe I actually like this stuff as a kid.   Was it always this bad?  I'd like to think not,  but seriously, just stop it...jokes over.   I'm giving 2-stars only because the employees seemed to be on point and I had no issue there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ahhhh, donuts. \n\nAhh, Dunkin Donuts \n\nBefore there was ever a thought of Starbucks, decades even, there was a Dunkin Donuts! \n\nEach city seemed to have it's own branded coffee and donut shops -- while Dunkin Donuts is mostly a northeast brand, SoCal had Winchell's, Seattle had Peet's and NY had Chock Full of Nuts; and, in fairness to my Canadian friend's, Tim Horton was still play hockey in the NHL. \n\nSo, why did Dunkin Donuts survive and become a national brand?  Well, I believe it had to be the way they roasted their beans. Yes, the taste of their coffee is unique and habit forming. Dunkin Donuts makes a strong but not highly caffeinated brew that makes you come back for more. \n\nThis local rollout of Dunkin Donuts in the Valley of the Sun is a good thing. And, this Dunkin Donut has some of the nicest employees who aim to please. \n\nAnd, like their competitors to the north (Tim Horton's) Dunkin Donuts is now introducing sandwiches to capture the lunch crowd which means I stop by more once each day.\n\nNice job guys! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Placed a take-out order of vegetable pakoras, shahi paneer, garlic naan, and papadum. Did not receive the pakoras at all, the naan was COLD (not even lukewarm), the papadum was burned, and the shahi paneer was crappy. As your lawyer, I advise you to become a patron of any other indian place in the valley but this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointed.  Normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic.\n\nYesterday, I ordered carryout Chipotle Yucatan salad for lunch.  The menu said the salad included cilantro and avocado.  The salad was pretty small compared to what I have gotten in the restaurant in the past.  I got exactly 3 TINY chunks of avocado and ZERO cilantro.  For $10, I expected a bigger salad and it should have plenty of ingredients.\n\nIn addition, it was a hot MESS.  Looked like it was originally put into the 'dine in restaurant' bowl and someone realized it was carryout and then just scraped it into the styrofoam box. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seems to me that Champaign-Urbana would be a great market for an outstanding breakfast restaurant, with all the visiting parents wanting to take their kids out for breakfast.    Le Peep isn't that place.  It fits well in the category of mediocre breakfast restaurants in Champaign.  The wait times are very long (and not accurately assessed by the staff) in a very small waiting area.  Add slow service, noisy atmosphere, and uninspired yet pricey food, and that all adds up to mediocre at best.  I'm still searching for an exceptional breakfast expericence. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Came here to service my 2011 Subaru Forester, the brakes were making noise and after getting a ridiculous quote from Goodyear I came to Folder Subaru.  They replaced my rear brake pads and machined the rotors, along with treating my car brakes and replacing the middle seatbelt both due to recalls.  They did this all in one day and my technician Larry was very helpful and called to check up after a couple of days that everything was fine.  You have to  expect to pay more at a dealership, but they charged me a reasonable fee and I would definitely come back for future service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I always want to like this place but I just can't. I'm fine with paying a bit more for great customer service, but the prices are significantly higher and often the customer service is no-where to be found. It is hard to navigate this store and my experience is that finding someone to help you is often as difficult as finding what you are looking for, if not more so. Another problem is with what the store calls \""seasonal items.\"" In other words, be prepared for the possibility that whatever you buy will not be returnable, even if it is unopened and unused. I have found that Ace does have a different / larger selection than Home Depot or Lowe's on certain specialty items (for example, signs and doggie doors). But I still begin with Home Depot or Lowe's first and visit Ace only as a last resort. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like this place!!!\n\nThe food is cooked to order and everything I've tried has been delicious!\n\nThe pita bread is always soft and fresh warmed to perfection with whatever topping you choose burgers, chicken breast or make it into a gyro! Any choice is super delicious! \n\nThe seafood is also delicious! The shrimp are crispy and the fish sandwich is one of the best I've ever had, with the crinkle cut fries or onion rings and you have a delicious meal! \n\nBest part of all...they are not expensive at all for less than $10 you can get a very filling hot meal...which in my book is not bad at all!\n\nThe staff here are all super friendly and the manager walks around asks about your day and even refills your drinks! \n\nThis place is definitely going to the top of my YUMMY list! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My finac\u00e9 and I went to Fred Meyer to buy an engagement ring, and we ended up with the whole wedding set for the price we were hoping to pay for just the engagement ring. Their service was awful but you can't beat their prices. After about 80 days of wearing the ring one of the center stones fell out, and they refused to fix it. I realized that you can't beat their prices but most anyone can beat their service, so we returned all 3 items. After searching endlessly for the perfect ring online, I found myself wanting a more personal experience with this whole process, so I yelped some ring stores in my area. I found Burland, and after reading the other reviews on this page I had my heart set on finding the perfect ring there. A week later we were walking out of the store with it. The entire experience there was perfect. I love my ring. We worked with Jan who was so sweet and couldn't possibly have been more helpful. They worked with my budget, I mean they REALLY worked with it, and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for a friendly, welcoming, family operated store this is definitely the place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Is the food here Thai or Chinese?? Where is the basil, an important ingredient in Thai cuisine, in their dishes?? And the fish sauce, another crucial ingredient that marks Thai flavors?? This could pass for Americanized Chinese food though but I'll pass on this place next time... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is a classic \""don't be fooled by the outside\"" place. Located across from CPCC in an unassuming strip mall with a tiny parking lot, this little gem is just waiting to make your date more interesting, your mouth do a little dance and your wallet skip a beat!\n\nI always go for lunch here because it's $5.99-$6.99 for the same size portions as dinner (dinner is around $10-$12). I always get the spicy chicken dish and await the fun. \n\nTo those who don't know (I didn't before I went here!), Ethiopian food doesn't come with utensils, instead it's plated on this spongy bread which you break off and use to pick up the food. It's amazing and like I mentioned above, a great place to take a date. Most people have probably never been to a place like this and it's an experience AND a meal which I like.\n\nThe meal comes on a large plate with the spongy bread and on top of it is a garden salad with a light Italian dressing, a pureed dish of some sort that's amazing, and the protein you've chosen with onions, spices and a sauce. Sometimes you'll get veggies and potatoes too, depending on what you order. I like it spicy and I always think they give a perfect amount of heat. Simple food that really speaks for itself is what you'll get here, but the portions are great so you'll never walk out hungry!\n\nI've never tried dessert here, but I'd be willing to it if I ever had enough room left over! They do have soda in cans and beers in bottles. I believe this is a family owned place (husband/wife), as I have been going since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and the wife has always been the waitress and is sometimes pregnant and sometimes not! :)\n\nDo yourself a favor and check out this place. Bring a friend, a date, and enjoy the experience AND the food! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food options are spread out, expensive, and impersonal.  The service at US Airways is impolite, and the entire experience is stressful.  This used to be my favorite airport, but now I find it nothing but a hassle. <|endoftext|>

They claim to have been in business for 20 years and I doubt they have ever cleaned the place or had an OSHA inspection!\nSales person Cesario lies and is a master in Bait & Switch.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie. \n\nOne slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza. \n\nAvoid. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.\n\nYou want scenery? Try desert.\n\n\nYou want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?  Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.\n\nYou want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah, they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!? <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Guys did very good job fixing my car after a small accident. They've dealt with the insurance company and explained everything exceptionally well. Everything was superb. They definitely take pride in what they do.\nI give them only one star because they broke a button (pulled it out and lost) on my stereo while cleaning the interior. When I pointed it out, they've promised to replace it. It's been three weeks of silence now.\nThey'll get 5 stars from me when they keep their promise. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Seriously, honest, reliable, thorough shop.  The first time I took my car in, they beat the dealer's repair quote by more than $2000, told me what I actually did and didn't need and prioritized the work that I needed done.

I've experienced better.\"" \nThis is perfectly applied to That's Rentertainment for the following reason: it's a place where people drive their cars to in order to pay money to rent a disc which they then have to watch and return to the location before a certain time or be subject to a fine. \n\nTrue, this is the case with all video rental stores, and comparatively That's Rentertainment is the best around. But that's like saying that Circuit City is the best place to get replacement ink for your fax machine. It's old technology and it needs to die. \n\nThe internet (whether used legally or illegally) is far and away the most practical and logical place from which to get your movies. \n\nIf you want to travel into the past, go to the Early American Museum in Mahomet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm somewhat of a bike junky, and after stopping by a few other shops in Central Phoenix to check them out, I was sorely disappointed by the selection. Then I popped into Slippery Pig. I loved the selection, the variety, and the level of interest in what I wanted. I wasn't even planning on buying a bike and told the guy that. He didn't seem to care and showed me around anyway. \nI've since gotten a few accessories there and have been pleased by the staff's suggestions and service. Maybe there's some mystery d-bag roaming around there, judging from some of the lousy reviews, but I've never had anything but exemplary service. \nI'll reserve a fifth star for when I either buy a bike or get some more substantial service here. In the meantime, Slippery Pig will remain my LBS. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I heard about Cheesecake Factory from \""The Big Bang\"" TV Show, so when I went there my first time, I was expecting something different, but since my arrival everything was amazing, I loved the place, the service n the food...since then I keep coming back to try n enjoy new dishes :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The staff was very impolite. Everythin is over priced. I would try the places in Marketplace before ever coming here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The last year of home delivery of this newspaper is the worst I have ever seen.  When you call to complain, you get someone in a foreign country who can do nothing to assist you with your issue.  I finally gave up and cancelled my subscription.  When I told the person on the phone I wanted to cancel it, she asked on what day.  Isn't that as simple as when my subscription expires?  \n\nGetting the paper at the convenience store is more reliable than the home delivery service of the Charlotte Observer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Man, we were really looking forward to this. After watching the Sichuan episode of Bizarre Foods the other day I realized that, while I have had Sichuan dishes before, I had never had hot pot. We usually go to the Chinese Cultural Center for Golden Buddha and had never tried Szechwan Palace.\n\nSo, the four of us headed over there with eager anticipation. There were warning signs right away. Wife: \""I'd like hot tea please.\"" Waiter: \""we're out of cups!\"" They were out of other stuff too. Still, we found plenty to order. Food started coming out pretty fast, one dish at a time, over a period of about a half an hour. If you want all of your food at once you would hate this, but we were sharing everything anyway, so that part did not bother me. \n\nBut lots of other stuff did bother me. Dan Dan Noodles were good. Everything else was bland...including the hot pot. They forgot our spicy dumplings. The waiter disappeared for about twenty minutes at a time. Our table was placed in such a way that people were constantly asking me to move my chair. I could go on. Just a bad customer service experience and average food. Very, very disappointing, <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you are wondering whether you should go to the Rose Bowl, then you probably should not. This is a redneck townie bar for redneck townies, to the exclusion of all others. This is the sort of place in which the record skips* if anyone not fitting this precise description walks in. If you are that intrepid adventurer seeking a new experience, you will find yourself in an uncomfortable paradox: all attention is on you, yet the bartender is not aware you exist.\n\nThe bar is dark and a little dusty. Decor is of the promotional variety, with some pretty interesting stuff from back in the day, as well as a good representation of Nascar hoods. They usually have a good price on drafts and even pitchers, but only of bland domestic macros. There are a few video games and even a Megatouch. Live bands playing both kinds of music (Country & Western) stop by several times a week, and I have heard that some of those bands are pretty good.\n\nBefore you write this off as a typical Chambana-by-way-of-Chicago student snob poo-pooing the local scene, please know that I appreciate dives as much or more than most, and can swallow swill as fast as you can pour it into a plastic cup. In my book, genuineness is a turn-on, dirt don't hurt, and grits is good. However, that does not mean that I like going places where they don't make you feel welcome. If you want a great laid back joint nearby, try Bunny's. If'n you be wantin' a snarl, the stinkeye, and mebbe a stabbin', try the Rose Bowl.\n\n*They don't actually play records at the Rose Bowl, they play mp3's off a cpu with WinAmp. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family has been going to the Strip and shopping at Prestogeorge for years. When I moved to the DC area I couldn't find any coffee as good as Prestogeorge's. Luckily, you can order online and have it shipped to your house. Every time I order it comes to my door the next day. This is such a plus for me since I always wait until the last minute to order coffee when I'm running low. You can order whole beans or have them ground to your specific coffee pot/french press. My favorite flavor of coffee is coconut cream. My only complaint is that they don't send you a receipt via email or shipping confirmation. But really, who needs an email when it comes the next day with a printed receipt in the box? Please give this place a try if you're looking for the best and freshest coffee around! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really wanted to like this bakery! I came in with high expectations, I'll admit, because I thought I had heard good things about it. I bought about four different pastries to sample with a friend so we could eat them with our coffee across the street. Though the presentation of the treats were lovely, every single one I picked out was sickeningly sweet and tasted the same as the next. Far too much frosting on each pastry and we only could finish one small pastry between the two of us. Overall, unimpressed. However, it probably doesn't help that I had just come back from Austria which arguably has the best pastries in the world! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Where to start with this review?  I will first start with the wonderful greeting at the door by the hostesses.  I am temporarily in a wheel chair and they just couldn't be quick enough to make sure we were able to get into the door without it being awkward for me.  We had a reservation so we were immediately seated, in a very comfortable spot where my chair wouldn't inconvenience other diners.  That is very important to me, because when I go out to dine, the last thing I want is for my experience to be ruined because of other diners not being considerate. \n\nNext, we were greeted by our server Ken, who by the way happens to be about one of the best servers I think I have ever encountered in this type of establishment.  That isn't to say that our local haunts that we frequent often are not just as good because they are, but this is about this particular experience.  Ken was extremely knowledgeable about their very extensive wine list and very knowledgeable about the specials and how things in the kitchen were prepared.\n\nThe first thing we ordered were the lobster and crab cakes. We asked if they were more meat than breading and he informed us that they were very meaty and he wasn't exaggerating.  I have a very hard time eating much especially if bread is involved.   These were amazing.  I ordered the double bone lamb chops med rare and they came out perfectly, perfectly seasoned and were very good.  My husband ordered the steak delmonico (spelling) and he ordered it med rare also (there is no point in eating it any other way)  Well Ken actually suggested that my husband order this steak medium because of the way the marbling cooked, and so it was ordered medium and he was not steered wrong.  With that we shared the lobster mac & cheese, and wow, just wow.  I am not a lobster lover by any stretch because I've always found it to taste like dirt and be very tough.  I guess the difference here is claw meat rather than a tail. Whatever the difference was, we absolutely loved it.  The only issue of the whole night was SO MUCH FOOD. That isn't a bad thing, we have a teen at home, and how many teens get rack of lamb as a doggy bag?  We did take home some desserts to share with the young one.  \n\nNow to praise the management team.  It isn't all that unusual for managers to come to your table and ask how your meal is, but I have to say that Torri and Bow went out of their way to make sure we were having a wonderful experience, and we noticed that it seemed to be just the way of doing business at the Capital Grille.  It is so nice to be just an average joe and feel like you are a VIP on a night out.  So a personal thank you to both of them for making us feel so special. \n\nIn short, you can't go wrong here.  Excellent service, excellent food that is quite frankly just as simple as it gets, and beautifully done.  A peeve of mine is having a bunch of useless stuff on my plate that just gets thrown away.  Plating can be beautiful without all that, and the Capital Grille has that down. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Been to the Majerle's in Phoenix, but this review is for the new place in Chandler - as I can't remember the last time I visited the downtown estab.  The bottom line.  Avoid like the plague.  A couple observations:\n- The place was total sausage fest.  Like 20 dudes to one girl.  During happy hour.\n- Worst fish and chips imaginable.  Now what place on earth serves up cookie-encrusted grease-soaked cod with sugar-laced french fries???  Yuck.\n- The tartar sauce to go with that?  Nope.  Just all mayo.\n- Hot wings, surprisingly, we're okay.\n- Philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick.\n- Cole slaw, more like sugar slaw.\n\nPlace blows.  So many other great places in the East Valley to visit with your hard earned dollar.  Vote elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  HORRIBLE HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!!!!\nChecked my mother in for a cough via Emergency room. DR wanted to keep her overnight and staff told us a room was available. SEVEN HOURS LATER they took her up to a room....finally ER stopped waiting on someone to transport her and took her up to the room on her own....THE WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE FOR A A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm granting one star because there's no way to give none.\n\nAs I write this, the door to my room is open, and two burly gentlemen are drilling and hammering and drilling and hammering--I just checked, and it's going to go on all day. Evidently, the inn is installing a new lock system, and for some reason it was impossible to wait until I checked out later today. Counting on solitude and quiet, I'd brought work to do, but it's now utterly impossible to concentrate. I stayed here once before and loved it, but this lack of concern and respect sets a a new low. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the worst airport I've ever had the displeasure of passing through. Sure, there are some decent places to eat, but every single time I have to make a connection through Charlotte Douglas it's delayed by several hours. I haven't been to any other airport with as many delays and with such frequency. I'd gladly sacrifice the Pinkberry for a more punctual schedule. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was my boyfriends birthday and we were trying to find a new pizza place worthy of us not going to oreganos anymore. And after reading all these reviews, Im wondering if I just went on a bad night? But good restaurants shouldnt have \""bad nights\"" right? Aside from the friendly service over the phone, nothing was worth going back for. My bf is a huge ricotta fan so I decided to order the ny white pizza and some garlic bread. The gentleman over the phone told me 25min and I showed up in 20. Everything was ready and I walked in and out within one minute. I shouldve known instantly that something wasnt right. One thing i love about oreganos is that they show you the pizza before you walk out. When i got in the car and looked at the pizza, the cheese was already crusted solid on top, showing that it had been sitting under a heater for maybe 10min or so. By the time I got home (a few blocks away), my pizza was room temperture, the cheese on top was rock hard and i couldnt taste ANYTHING but GARLIC GARLIC GARLIC. Super disappointing. Back to Oregano's we go.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been coming to this Schlotzsky's for 6 years. The old man is the rudest a**hole you will EVER meet! Half the time he helps me and when he does he talks to me like I am a 5 year old and is EXTREMELY condescending. Even while taking my money he was being sarcastic and rude. When confronting him about the way he spoke with me and how he does it EVERY time I come in, he told me I must only come one or twice a year. In reality, I patronize this company 10-12 times a year, even knowing I am going to be treated like I am wasting his time. The wife is BEYOND amazing! How she puts up with him...I have NO IDEA! I can guarantee I will NEVER spend my money here again. The food is great but absolutely NOT worth putting up with someone treating me so nasty. <|endoftext|>

It can get loud at times, but nothing headphones won't fix. \n\nLove their iced coffee and iced tea of the day, especially the acai green tea. The pumpkin chocolate chip bread is really moist and delicious as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have traveled through so many airports over the years, Denver, Chicago, Omaha, New York, Ontario, Amsterdam, Denpasar, Tokyo, Taipei, London, Munich, Kingston, Bangkok and the list goes on. Phoenix Sky Harbor ranks as the WORST airport of all time. Upon my flight arrival, exiting the tarmac ramp at the Frontier Airlines gate, I saw no electronic billboards, no tv screens and no information for connecting flights. No airport assistants or volunteers either! A TSA employee directed me to another security screening area. It turned out he gave me  the wrong directions. By the time I reached that wrong TSA check point a second TSA agent directed me to a MAZE of directions. Sheinformed me that I needed to go past the baggage pickup, out the door and far away. By that time, I had just minutes to make it to my flight back to Hawaii (home). I finally found an \""assistance\"" desk on my way past the luggage pickup. He told me to exit the building, go outside, walk 30 feet and wait for a bus that would take me to my gate(US Airways Terminal).  He also tells me I am going to miss my flight. As I'm running like crazy, I see another man getting directions from a TSA agent! Meanwhile, I'm standing OUTSIDE thinking \""what the heck!\"" Finally the bus came and it dropped me off at the US Air terminal. Then I ran up an escalator, across a path and finally to TSA security where I had to go through security once again. As if they couldn't see I was out of breath. I know they looked at my ticket and saw my flight time! The TSA agent held up my screening because I took my laptop out of it's case and laid it \""on top\"" of the thin, neoprene case. \""I have to run this through again. You need to put the case in another bin and just leave the laptop in the bin all by itself.\"" Wow! I haven't heard that one in ALL my travels!  I gave a grateful smile with an apology then ran like heck about 250+ feet to my gate. They were just closing the door!!!!!!  \nSky Harbor needs a closed airport layout. You should never have to leave and go outside to a connecting flight!  Thats just dangerous security-wise. Until Sky Harbor has a seamless airport (i.e. Denver)  they need workers out in the terminal gates assisting travelers. They need TV \nmonitors! Lots of them! Never again Sky Harbor! Never! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't help but feel this Restaurant has fooled many. \n\nWhile I've read the food described as \""Authentic Italian,\"" I felt it was anything but.  I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...\n\nI suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. \n\nHowever, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \""they asked for doubles.\"" Who orders a double Merlot? \n\nWe chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. \n\nWhat arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. \n\nI'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place!\nThis is a hidden gem in uptown, it's a cozy place with good food and even better service.\nThe first time I went for lunch I ordered the Baja quesadilla and I almost cried because the chicken on it tasted like a dish that we eat in Mexico. Besides the quesadilla my other two favorites are two vegetarian sandwiches Fallafel and Jeniffer, I'm not vegetarian but they are delicious. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went there for lunch today 3/2/13.  Business hours posted said they closed at 4PM on Saturday's.  Then why the hell were they close at 350PM ?  I will never visit this establisment again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Camarones aguachile are aweeeeeeeeeeeeeesome!!!\n\nI love this place if you like seafood and Mexican food then look no further this place is the bomb.  The service is good, they have great drinks alcoholic and non, and the food is amazing.  Plus the ceviche tostada for free at the beginning along with chips and salsa just tops off how wonderful this place is.  \n\nI admit it is pricey but the ingredients are fresh and we are in the desert so you gotta pay for good stuff and this place is for sure worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been driving past this intriguing little place for years now, and finally stopped in to satisfy my curiosity. I had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch, as the food wasn't very good, but I was craving a hamburger and in the area, so to MacAlpine's I went.\nOnce I figured out which door granted entrance to the diner (seriously, it took three tries),  I was greeted by some awfully pretty and very in-character waitresses. They were all dolled up, '50s style and had that sweetie-pie personality down pat. I admitted I wasn't too familiar with places that offer so many soda options and asked for a recommendation. The server gladly offered her favorites, and I went with her suggestion, a cherry cheesecake soda. It was fantastic.\nI looked over the menu and was immediately disappointed, why is a turkey burger featured above the all-American diner staple, the cheeseburger?! And no fries? I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life. Dry, flavorless, terrible. Well, I had been warned and can't exactly complain.\nSeeing as I'm not a soda drinker and wasn't a fan of the food, I won't be back. But the atmosphere and food quality would suit children well, and I saw several come and go, usually with their grandparents. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There are so many Asian restaurants, including the Chinese Cultural Center near by the office.  Little Shanghai has been by far the most consistent with the quality and customer service.  The delivery is super quick to our office (about 2 miles away), they never miss an order and the food is great.  I always get the Beef and Broccoli and the office usually splits a few orders of Pork, Vegetable or Chicken lo mein.  Very yummy stuff!\n\n2 years later, still great food and service!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I spent a weekend at the Royal Palms Resort in mid-November. Let me preface my review by saying that usually I stay at Motel 6, but I've decided that at age 50, life is too short for hard beds, lumpy pillows, creepy carpet and ice machines right outside your door, no matter how screamin cheap it is. Amazing that when you pay more, it's really, really nice, The grounds are gorgeous and lush, meandering little paths, fairy lights, fountains and outdoor fireplaces at night. Reasonably attractive guests (not to heavy on the gold bling, yet we were in Phoenix so not particularly tastefully understated either). The R.P. was the venue for a couple of \""Bride Magazine\"" weddings (generous breasts but not really over the top, so to speak, and nicely tanned ASU sorority and fraternity members who got a bit sloppy as the evening wore on. Clearly the dads have been minimally impacted by the \""economic crisis\"". Excellent service, not a hint of snootiness. Just warm and efficient. We liked the pre-paid $22.00 gratuity charge. It eliminated all traces of sucking up and false cheeriness. The fitness facility was decent with a lovely outdoor stretching area on the second floor. Nice roomy hot tub and iced citrus water magically offered to rehydrate and wet our whistles. Still I could have done without the \""romantic spanish guitar muzak\"" constantly playing in the background, clearly providing ambiance for those who don't know the difference. I happen to, being a classical and jazz musician. It makes my husband crazy, but what's wrong just rustling palms and trickling water? Must we always have to listen to someone else's musical selections? Okay, how was our room? Not bad, but probably the weakest part of the resort. Certainly an atmospheric \""love shack\"" for 2 mature adults who have been married forever. Don't know what they intended us to do with all those pillows. For the bi-focal set, the room was too dark and clearly designed before CFL's became the new green way to save energy. Royal Palms, the light is cold, cold, cold. Deep six the cutesy stenciled Disney birds on the walls and re-paint. Color does matter! Excellent bathroom with plenty of shower space for fun and recreation. Very plush bed was too squeaky and springy for my aging back. For the money, I expect dead quiet and a mattress to die-for.  However, all in all I'd rank the R.P. highly, would recommend it to friends,  and would consider returning for another respite from the Colorado cold. <|endoftext|>

South Hills icon. \n\nThere's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs. \n\nPreach. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was very unimpressed with this Olive Garden location.  The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.\n\nSecondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.\n\nI also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The owner does not care about the employees.  Reducing hours to PT to alleviate paying health insurance and vacation time.  Great staff area leaving.  The pricing and markup is also incredible!\n\nGo somewhere else that supports employees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Another five-star review, this one from a newbie.  The brakes on my Honda fit were making a frightful sound.  I was sure I'd get the full-rotor press from the chains, because that's kind of their job.  The dealer sold me the car in the first place, so I don't like them. (Not 100% happy with the Fit).  A little research turned up Walter's 42 5-star reviews, so I thought I'll give them a try.  I wasn't certain they'd be able to see me soon enough, but whatever.  Walter called me back within 1/2 hour, told me to get the car in ASAP to make sure it was safe to drive, 'and then if you have to go somewhere and wait, you have to go somewhere and wait.\""  I delivered my car 1/2 hour after that, went somewhere and waited, and had it back, fixed, within another hour, for less than 200 bucks. Walter's garage from now on. Yep. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Saw some mixed reviews on Yelp, but I wanted nice food and live music.  I don't know if we just hit them on a good day, but everything was just about perfect for us.\n\nThe calamari with fried grapes and olives was super.  The scallop appetizer was even better.\n\nI adored my tenderloin entree, ad the desert was the best part of the evening. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  No good. And it's a big shame because with the awesome location If they actually had decent food this place could be jumpin every night. My mom who's been here several times warned us before we left \""we go here for the views and to be outside some nights, but really you can only get a few of the appetizers and vegetables if you want anything ok\"". <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Half price burgers on Saturdays - which also applies to the veggie and chicken versions (but not the 3/4 pound beef ones) - are a great idea. For traditional patties, you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger. The Mac & cheese isn't necessarily worth the $1 upgrade, so don't bother - unless you want to pay for boxed mac&cheese that has some bacon bits tossed on top. They have a good selection of beers and sodas (be aware that it's not Pepsi *or* Coke products but RC/Dr. Pepper). I thought the draft of Bell's two-hearted complemented my Urbana veggie burger quite nicely. If they'd offered ice cream for dessert, it would have been true love. Also, note that it was very crowded (and noisy) indoors but that they have an extensive patio. There was an upstairs space as well, but they apparently only open that for table service *some* of the time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am a new resident to the City of Charlotte. In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area, to celebrate my friends Birthday, we came across this quant  place. bypassing 5star gourmet restaurants we opted to have  a quite dinner with some soul food. The restaurant was interestingly decorated  and the menu was appetizing.  The service on the other hand was not.  I had never tried shrimp and grits before  so I being a special occasion I decided to try something new. when the dish came to the table the presentation was nice however the taste was not satisfactory. it was overloaded with onion and It was not enjoyable to me. So I then asked the waitress if something could be done because I didn't like  the dish. She told me \""I have to get the manager, because I can't change once the food is on the table.\""  I told her that was fine. The manager never came to offer any apologies nor explain what the solution could be. the waitress comes back after like 15mn and says \""She says pick something of the menu and we'll trade it out.\"" I then chose the chicken dinner. The waitress nor the food did not come back for almost another 20mn. she then comes to the table not to refill drinks or to apologize for the wait. but to offer to bag up the meal and bring the check. at this point I was embarrassed for bringing my friend to this place and irritated because I was hungry and very annoyed with the service I told her yes please bring the check. she brings a check not only with the meal I changed for but also the initial meal that I did not eat. I was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress. that waitress says sure she's the lady over there in the red shirt.  and walks the other way.  So I then call the manager over to clarify that this was a mistake. she says \""If the owner was here he would not be playing with y'all. He would make you pay for both. I on the other hand will take it off.\"" I was floored at the way she spoke to me and the fact that the owner would make a patron pay for something they didn't like. I felt stereo typed and embarrassed that it was my people to treat us this way. So needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever! I hope this is not hospitality in Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was on Saturday.\n\n7:35pm arrived and got seated immediately\n7:36-7:49pm watched servers walking by, chefs bringing food out themselves, and the hostess doing nothing\n7:50pm got our waters and \""a server will be with you shortly\""\n7:51-7:59pm tried to understand what the word \""shortly\"" meant\n8pm walked out\n\nWe went to Sushi Kame and we received way more attentive service.\n\nI might visit Kamakura again \""shortly\"". <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Only use this store if you want your package to be lost or stolen, and never delivered!  We tried to ship two Christmas packages, and the never arrived, the store couldn't even supply tracking numbers, and they were of zero help trying to rectify the situation.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!\n\nNEXT TIME WE WILL USE FEDEX. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not exactly French food, but very satisfying.  Huge meatballs and a seriously tasty burger for a fair price will have my friends and I return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Goddamn I wanted a french dip tonight. Meaty, juicy shavings of meat in a soft roll with a warm au jus. That's all I wanted.\n\n5 & Diner gave me a prime rib dip, which didn't quite satisfy. The bread was great, but the meager spat of buttery prime rib with slimy onions wasn't what I was hoping for. While the au just was tasty, I expected something more. Seemed like it was missing a spice.\n\nFrench fries were great and the chocolate shake was EXCELLENT. I'd go again in hopes I just picked a bad night, but it was pretty pricey, so if I'm a disappointed again, they're done. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> if you want delicious americanized mexican, colon cancer causing food, then come here.\nif you want authentic, go to mexico. \nno but really. they have ridiculous sized margaritas and martinis. \ni really think that's what they should be called. \""RIDICULOUS SIZED\""\nit's like \""may i please have the gallon sized cosmo? yes by myself. yes thank you i'll need a cab.\"" \ni love the abodaba pizza and the pollo con queso. \nbeen coming here for years and i still love it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was a pass through. When I stopped by, it was pretty crowded and there was a dearth of outlets <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BEWARE...if you want a reservation for less than four people, you are out of luck! Apparently there is one table in the dungeon that is reserved for parties less than four but it was reserved for he night. However, we were invited to sit in the bar...yipeee!!! I think it's good for them that they are busy, but I think they should seriously evaluate how they treat new customers. This place was highly recommended, but impossibly unaccessible. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Lobby is very nice.  Service was nice but weird I wanted to book under either my AAA or government rate but the front desk said I had to call the main ritz number to do that.  I literally went to my car and did that.  All the people at the hotel were very nice but don't know why it is like that.  Bar and common areas are nice. Other guests are old uptight douches.  Drinks overpriced.  Rooms are not nice.  Old...just didn't feel like a ritz.  Just came from nice rooms in Vegas so maybe jaded but really they should refurbish. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! .\nI went to order something for my office and did so online. but for some reason the company they use for group orders some how some way got messed up. so Schlotzsy's never had my order. So after almost an hour of waiting I  called them and they  didn't even have my order. so they took it and an hour later we got the food. Then the next day I get a phone call saying i did something wrong and could i fix it so they can get there money. So i tried and it kept  kicking me  for some reason so now not only do they want there money they wont me to take time out of my work day to come down and pay for it at the store. Really!?!  I tell you customer care and service right out the window. I will never ever order from this location again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Anyone who rates this 4 stars is an idiot. I probably would have given it 2 stars based on the fact, that they serve the exact same generic Chinese as everyone else. But then add in the \""cheap factor\"". I ordered a ton of food, and your delivery driver (whom I tipped) doesn't even give a single packet of soy sauce!!! Really??? Well on the plus side, I won't throw my money down the toilet with this company again <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think it goes without saying that you can't expect the best steak in Champaign, IL. That being said, their steak is well above average and fairly priced. The whole \""cook your own steak\"" idea is an interesting concept, but if that's what I wanted to do I would buy my own steak (for much less) and cook it myself at home. Pay the extra $3 for a chef to make it for you so you can relax and enjoy your meal. The service is always very friendly and they make themselves available. By far my favorite steakhouse in the Champaign-Urbana area and recommend it to all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Honestly, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews for this place, but it seems that all the newer (2013 start and forward) have been positive, and we have good things to say about it too!  The pork fried rice is amazing and the pot stickers are a new fave also.  I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  \n\nThe cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  \n\nOther bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!\n\nOverall: A\nWe highly recommend the pot stickers and fried rice with any of the meat additions (chicken, pork, beef, etc.) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Two stars because the food is still good, but anyways I have been to this chipotle many times and it's a 50-50 thing but their customer service is the worst out of any chipotle I've been to in phoenix. I honestly waited 10 minutes from the time the lady started my burrito to the time I checked out. Total b.s. Then the lady who was on the register proceeded to charge me 9.75 for a chicken burrito where most chipotles only charge 7.00 for the same thing and she didn't even apologize or even look at me for making me and 10 other people wait for 10 minutes to be helped. Oh yeah, they were making food for themselves too and putting it in front of the customers food. Great job on employee training. Total joke. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is just okay. Almost all the sauces (even the guacamole) are watered-down and they aren't shy about using a microwave right in front of the customers; it's right behind the front counter, and I watched a guy nuke my nachos & cheese before topping them off. If you can overlook these things, this place is all right; certainly better than Del Taco or Taco Bell or anything like that in that at least they cut their own produce and don't have a manufactured taste. Not the best for you, but if you're thinking about eating here or at any Mexican-style restaurant around, you probably aren't super-interested in being health-conscious, anyway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is amazing!! Just the people that work here are always half asleep. Not energetic at all. I LOVE the wheatgrass shots, seriously I always need to drink the 2 oz shot when I eat unhealthy or when I'm hungover. A great fast way to detox. I love to get anything that has an anti-oxidant. I also like to get the turkey sausage and egg breakfast wrap. One thing is that this place usually is never busy so they're fast! over all if the employees were to be a bit more bubbly I would give this place 5 stars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Marcellino Ristorante is a truly excellent Italian restaurant. There are many options especially in Scottsdale for fine dining, especially if one craves Italian cuisine. However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was attending a conference at a nearby hotel and wandered in for lunch one day. I had a chicken burrito that left me disappointed: cubes of white chicken meat in a watery green sauce that had little flavor and no heat, wrapped in a non-descript tortilla, with rice and beans.\n\nService was good, price was reasonable, but the food wasn't even remotely interesting and that's a pity. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> nice selection of beer and they have Green Line on tap! the bartender who was there when we went was great at recommendations for all different tastes. cheap prices and a cool divey feel. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A Midwest girl's Cuban haven.\n\nI went here twice Valentine's Day weekend. 5 stars for the mojitos. 5 stars for the Black Bean Fritters. 5 stars for the service.\n\nVery casual, cozy environment. I'll be back here the next time I'm in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place rocks. 'Nuff said.\n\nCheap drinks, awesome bar staff, stiff pours.. I love this place.\n\nThey have seen me at my worst, my best and all in between, and no one passes judgement.\n\nSwizzle- stay classy my friend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very helpful staff w/ selling and inventory. Will definitely come here again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Outstanding family Mexican restaurant! I've tried several of the other well known Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and Comedor Guadalajara is hands down the best of them all. Very large open restaurant concept (2 large rooms) with no bar but serves alcohol. No TV' either except in the entrance so keeps everyone focused on the group your with and food.\n\nLarge platters served so bring your appetite but the flavors are truly authentic and expertly cooked. Service was excellent. Try the7 Mares soup, seafood platters were fresh and delicious. Ejoy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place doesn't come close to living up to the Crowne Plaza name.  The rooms are clean enough however they have really cheapped out on the fixtures.  The dresser in the first room we were in had broken out bottoms in the dresser drawers and a running toilet.  The second room had two of the dresser drawers screwed shut because they were missing.  I will pass next time I am in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For a moment I will need you to ignore my name. Okay good, now that you have ignored it, let's talk about how freaking awesome this place \""Nicholas Coffee\"" is in Market Square. \n\nYeah I know what you are thinking, \""well you are just saying that because it's like your name\"" Wrong. You ignored my name as mentioned above so you know now there is no bias. \n\nMoving on. If you ever wanted really dive into coffee, please go here. For Pittsburgh it's basically the epicenter of caffeine. You walk in and can feel the roasted beans scurry up your nostrils to only have you feel delighted as you now bath in its smooth roasted goodness.\n\nThe downside here is there is really nowhere to sit and it's really just meant as a place to stop in and leave as oppose to hang around. \n\nThe upside is there is SO MUCH coffee to choose from. It will blow your freaking mind/ melt your brain. Whichever comes first.\n\nIf you really love coffee, come here. Mediocre coffee drinkers beware. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is average to slightly above average. That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.\n\nThe problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.\n\nSo in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family and I have been dining here for a few years now. Only thing I don't like are the odd hours, because it can be confusing at times. Seriously. There was a time we went to have lunch sometime during the week, and it was 3pm. When we got there, they were closed.\n\nAnyway, the food is great. The service isn't bad; not AMAZING, but not bad. :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One word SLOW appointments are worthless. You arrive 15 minutes early and get in 45 minutes late. They say 45 minutes to an hour it takes 2 hours. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I,m not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor, just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .\n         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think I can finally call off the hunt for the delish type of Mexican food I miss from home in Texas.  Simple menu, good prices and freshly made food that left us wanting more.  \n\nOur party of three ordered the beef chimi, the cheese enchiladas (no sauce) and the green chicken enchiladas.  At first we'd planned to order our dinner to go - that is until we laid our eyes on the salsa.  So many places just totally lack a good salsa, but this one looked bright and fresh.  It was delicious!  Vibrant and with a little kick, the mild salsa hit the spot.  And the self serve chips were perfect for our table.\n\nThe food arrived just in time as we finished up our salsa and chips, and it couldn't have looked more inviting!  We tucked in right away.  There was no conversation - this food was too good for talking!  \n\nThe place is cozy with only a few tables, but was still comfortable.  Plenty of folks came in and out for take out orders.  Each and every customer was greeted by a friendly guy, and the nifty credit card system even allowed for an emailed receipt instead of printing one out.  Great place that I will absolutely be trying again and again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best authentic German restaurant around! I go there for lunch and dinner. They always have good specials that normally aren't on the menu. Be sure to join their Beer Club, and definitely check out the annual Oktoberfest. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've lived in a number of apartments over the years and Crystal Creek was, by far, my favorite. It was a third floor one bedroom with a balcony that overlooked the pool. Since that balcony was on the west side I got a lot of sun some days but the sunsets and the thunderstorms made it worth it. I've often thought fondly of that apartment...\n\nThat was 7 years ago. Today, I learned that a few months ago Crystal Creek put a derogatory note on my credit for $62, lowering my score by 80 points. Seriously? After 7 years? Over sixty two dollars?\n\nI still don't even know what it was for. They haven't contacted me once in all this time - even though I lived in a property owned by their management company for three years after leaving Crystal Creek.\n\nThey insist that they're owed the money, too. I still don't know why. So now we have to go to court because I insist that they're high.\n\nDo you really want to live in a place where they'll go after your credit 7 years after the fact for a measly $62 without so much as a phone call? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The items off the regular menu are okay for what they are: cheap, fast food. But ordering from the lunch special, cheap as it is, can't be justified-- the food is plainly awful. The rice has the chemical aftertaste of tap water, the prawns are fried to a crisp (more crisp than meat and impossible to chew), and the chicken left me feeling like no amount of water could unpucker my mouth. It was dry and salty, 60% bland sauce, 30% of some unbreakable striated shell, and 10% actual chicken, and it tasted like the weird, gamey, dark, almost powdery dry gunk you get from the scraps off a chicken bone. And half the lunch box was made up of the rice aforementioned. I would only come back for the green beans. But why the hell would I do that? <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please Please Please Be More Customer Friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, this store cannot compare with those in nearby Las Vegas in service or variety. The sale associates (except for a nice, pretty brunette female) do not acknowledge you and they give off a vibe that you are bothering them. Rarely do they have my size shoe (Gucci men's 9) and they have about 1/3 of the typical Gucci inventory. If you ask about something they don't have, the associate doesn't offer alternatives or offers to have it shipped in for inspection. (LV does that without batting an eye). Security guards are stoic. They stare at you (I get it, it's their job) and if you say hello, they ignore you...they just stare. Makes me feel uncomfortable because I really want to be able to shop there. It is a shame because I would rather shop there vs lugging packages back from California or Vegas. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place offers solid authentic Chinese food. The register was packed when I arrived and the manager quickly noticed us hiding behind the swarm of people and we were quickly seated with apologies for the wait and noise. It is a slightly nicer place to have Chinese food in Chambana as the decor extends away from the fast food theme of their take-out menu.  My family and I received the 'authentic' blue menu upon arriving (I'm assuming because we are Chinese) but if you don't receive it automatically I highly suggest you directly ask for it.  \n\nThe all inclusive hot pot was one of the best things I had there and can easily be a full meal for a single person as it includes clear rice noodles for some filling carbs.  The shredded Szechuan spicy pork was a close second though it should be noted for people who don't know how Chinese pork is shredded, it is cut into thin slices and THEN cooked versus the famous bbq shredded pork in America which is slow cooked and then shredded by hand.  This leads to a more solid texture in the meat and it great when paired with thinly cut vegetables as they do with this dish. The ziran beef had strong flavors and wasn't drenched in a sauce like Americanized places.  For those who are afraid to try it, ziran means cumin so if you like cumin you will love this flavor of beef.  \n\nThe ambiance is great for large groups as most tables are large and plates are obviously meant for sharing. She does have small kids running around the area but I feel it adds to the homey feel of the restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have eaten at the Veggie house several times. The food is good, but the service is normally pretty slow. Do not head here if you are in a rush.\n\nI normally get sweet and sour pork. Pretty tasty dish. I have tried some other things, but did not particularly care for them.\n\nThis is predominantly Asian based, and pretty heavy dishes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You know the feeling you get when you haven't had a decent meal in what seems like days and all you want to do is break the fast with something amazing? That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...\n\nWhy was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... \""What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!\"" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.\n\nI seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.\n\nAs for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was really looking forward to Lidia's.  And was really disappointed.  \n\nBread was good. The cocktails were good.  The service was attentive and friendly (just don't get between a server dishing out the unlimited pasta and a hungry customer who clearly hadn't reached their limit with the unlimited servings).  \n\nToo bad the food wasn't good.  The beet salad was underwhelming.  I had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  I felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  I suspect such positive memories are no longer :(\n\nMy other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  Another disappointment.   \n\nAnd thus my rating of Meh. Which is a huge shame.  But life goes on... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish I could give negative stars.\n\nI've been with this bank for 20 years, and this means nothing to them. In the 20 years I've been with them they have done endless crap to me like auto-enrolling me in programs I don't want the latest of which caused over $300 in fees on my account. After calling them, they put me on hold for a while to \""review my account\"" (which obviously means to see if I am important enough to them to refund the fees). Apparently I am not. After holding I was told they won't refund them (again these are fees from a program I never signed up for). Insulting. This is what they continue to do to me after being with them for 20 years.\n\nI'm out. I can't take it anymore. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been hitting different venues around Charlotte for years listening to live music...including Visulite Theatre.  It's a favorite pastime of mine.  Last night we went to check out Shooter Jennings (who is awesome by the way).  When I got there I asked one of the bartenders for a couple of waters.  He had immediate attitude b/c I wanted water and then charged $3 per bottle.  Later, I went to the other bartender for another water.  Hmmm, he charged me only $2.  Being a local Charlottean who supports a lot of local music, that left a very bad taste...\n\nAs far as the venue, it's got a lot of potential but it needs some sound system updates.  If you are up close in the pit, you can see great, but the sound is muffled b/c the speakers are actually over your head.  \n\nDefinitely prefer Double Door and Neighborhood Theater to hear music.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The only negative thing i have to say about this place is that the lines are confusing and i had no idea if i need to stand in a particular line based off what i wanted to order or if i could just jump in wherever.\n\nThat being said, this place is awesome and very fairly priced. To say they have a shit ton of options would be something like saying The Beatles had a few fans. \n\nI will definitely be back here if i am ever passing through the Champaign region. \n\nGet out there, check it and yelp it! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible service.   I signed up for a three day pass online then finally got a chance to try the gym.   They told me that the pass expired and offered a one day pass.   The whole point was to try the gym at the times I go to see how crowded etc before I joined.   I'd rather take my business somewhere else if you can't allow someone to try your gym twice one time in the am and one time after work to see how busy and the accessibility to the equipment. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please do yourself and everyone else a favor by avoiding this rotten place!\n\nHanger employs a pack of sullen, lazy administrative good for nothings.  We asked them to immediately order and bill our insurance because we were two weeks from our annual plan renewing, which meant $500 out of pocket, in the month I was laid off. \nNice....\n\nTen days go by, my wife calls and was told that our insurance didn't cover it, that they would not order without 50% cash down. \n\n#1 Outright lie from the bitchy woman, they never contacted our insurance company, who will cover Orthotics 100%\n\n#2 Nobody called to inform us that they wouldn't order out without cash up front. (Because they sat on their fat backsides and never did a thing)\n\nThe woman my wife contacted early yesterday acted like she cared. But no call back yesterday afternoon or today. I called and they forwarded their calls to an answering service five minutes before 5:00.  Lazy, lazy, lazy. Did I mention nasty and surly?\n\nGo anywhere but Hanger!\nFYI, this was the 7th Street location as recommended by my wife's doctor, who is going to get an earful and lose a patient. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I generally like Walmart far more than I should and defend their sourcing ethics and quality far more than I'd like - that said, there are some real jerks working at this particular Wal-Mart, including the cart caretaker, the frozen foods produce wench, and the dude haphazardly chucking heads of lettuce into a bin to ensure their short shelf life.  \n\nDon't get me wrong folks, I know your job sucks, but at leas try not to make the customers shopping with you feel bad about their decisions. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pretty clean as far as Ross stores go, and no waiting in line!!! There were not many people here at all...only reason I didn't dish out the five stars is because the cashier had MAJOR attitude, she needs an adjustment pronto. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later, ALL of our food was brought out.  I was shocked.  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast.  My son took one bite, I didn't even bother, and we called the waiter back over.  I told her I expected fresh food, not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out.  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay.  I refused.  I will never go back.  There is such a thing as food too fast.  If I wanted fast food I'd have gone to Mickey D's. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They have a good selection of meat and its always fresh and good.  They could use a bigger selection of cheese, but whatever.  Their Chicken Salad and assorted potato salads are awesome...always fresh, always great.  Other than the deli/meat sections, its a typical small convenience store with higher than needed prices.  Go there for the meats and deli items, buy your other items elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family actually prefers this place to other pizza places in the area - or did before they stopped serving the onion rings! This place had some of the best onion rings, but mysteriously, they stopped serving them! \n\nThe pizza here is a lot like NJ/NY pizza. Cheesy with a crisp/bendy crust. The pizza really is very good. The mozzarella sticks are great also. \nPlease bring back the onion rings guys!! The meatball and chicken parm. sandwiches are VERY good. Great bread too.( the meatball sub could use a few more meatballs but is still delicious)\n\nWe still love ya and will order from you often! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.\n\nThis place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!\n\nWell, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \""plus an egg\"". The \""plus an egg\"" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.\n\nPlus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \""plus an egg\"". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu, the front of house staff quickly asked us whether or not we wanted to sit outside squished behind a baby's highchair in a corner or inside where it was very crowded. We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it, but it was just really crowded. When we returned the menu to the front of the house staff he snatched the menu away from us and said, \""Yeah I knew you guys weren't going to buy anything anyway\"". What if we were about to order something? That completely turned us away from this restaurant. We could tell we were just another group of people to get in and get out. Very rude and unacceptable. Never going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The French toast, oddly pancake style, is to die for. Also great to eat the ethnic food in the evening when available. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Yay for small theaters!!!! Seriously. All you people that love those huge grandiose things need to experience the intimacy and power that comes with a small theater, and a nice one on top of that. \n\nThe Herberger is in a great location and is a great venue to see a show. The staff is always really friendly and the space is always clean. It has class without being too stale and old. Like downtown hipster class. It's nice. Soothing. Fun. Good for all ages. \n\nThe bar inside also has a window for the outside patio which is great for nice evenings and intermissions :) Also, if you're lucky you will see some musical troubadours outside as well.\n\nOne awesome thing is that you can get parking validated for the Arizona Center for $3. You park there, take your ticket, then go to the Herberger box office and get a validation ticket. When you exit the Arizona Center, enter the ticket you got when you parked and then the validation one.\n\nSo now you have no more excuses not to go (if the light rail didn't help already).\n\nSee you there!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had been to Pooley's only once prior to this past Saturday. I really have no desire to return ever again. \n\nMy roommates and I had heard they have some pinball machines, and wanted to check that out. Who doesn't love pinball?! Well, their pinball machines ares mostly pretty lame. The only machine worthy of your time or money is the Star Trek machine, which is pretty awesome. The others aren't so great. The Addams Family machine looks awesome, but man does it cheat!\n\nSo we did quickly glance at Yelp regarding their food, and we thought it was probably going to be mediocre...but we were hungry.  And it was indeed mediocre. My chicken sandwich was pretty basic California Chicken. It came smothered in some sort of spread. If you are going to use a cheap bun, you can't just smother both sides! My sandwich felt apart immediately. Ugh. The chicken was a little underdone as well, verging on pink. I didn't get sick from eating it, so that's a plus. I gave half of it to my roommate and he didn't get sick either. So the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived. People seem to like their pizza, so maybe go with that.\n\nThe crowd was also interesting. A bunch of bros and bottle blondes. That sums it up pretty accurately, actually. I felt some hard glares from across the bar from some sketchy looking dudes. With limited physical strength, I would absolutely not feel safe going to Pooley's alone on a Saturday night. Absolutely not. Maybe the daytime crowd doesn't look so threatening. \n\nThe bartenders were friendly, and did a great job. They should migrate somewhere else, because I'd gladly order from them again. But, I will not return to Pooley's. No way. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think Calamari F. pretty much summed it up. OSF serves absolutely inedible \""Italian\"" food that is far worse than the usual Americanized Italian fare you get at chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. I would have rather had seafood alfredo from Red Lobster. The prices were also very high. The only good thing about our experience was the \""free\"" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. Avoid at all costs. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visited Juan's after reading the numerous complementary reviews. Unfortunately, our experience did not come close to that of more enthusiastic reviewers. The service left something to be desired, primarily because we had to wait over thirty minutes for our food to arrive, even though the restaurant was not packed until after we received our food. Additionally, I was not impressed by the tamale on my plate and found the cheese enchilada cold. My husband was also less than impressed by his chile relleno, but found it more edible than my food. Overall, we have had much better Mexican food at numerous other establishments in the Phoenix area and will not be returning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.  \n\nWhen we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there. \n\nI clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst service I've ever experienced. Called my order in 20min ahead and had to wait another 30min after I got there till my fries and pita were ready and there was no one else in the restaurant not a single person. It happened once and I thought it was a fluke but this is now the second time. Staff is incompetent and rude. The cooks just seemed to be hanging out and flirting with the server. I ordered pesto fries and they were out of pesto which they should have told me when I placed my order by phone instead of making me drive there to find out. Terrible I will never go there again which is sad because they're pesto fries are great but their service is so terrible I can't imagine going back and dealing with them. Service is everything and cypress grill is a prime example of losing business over service alone. I'm telling everyone I know and they have already stopped going because they are experiencing the same lack of professionalism and service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Oh my good god this place is amazing. Thank GOD we had a reservation because the place was freaking packed (Friday, dinner). \n\nThe service was on point - our server even took the time to write all the specials (and their descriptions, and there are a LOT) down on a piece of paper because we were sitting right in front of them and thus couldn't really see. We didn't ask him to do that - he just took it up on himself. Totally unnecessary, but it's that extra mile, folks. \n\nI got the Rokerij Benedict - all I can say is holy orgasm in my mouth. Forreals. Basically it's two little beef tenderloins on two english muffin halves, topped with CRAB and jalepe\u00f1o hollandaise.\n\nProbably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Ever. \n\nTheir green chile potato is their signature item and I found it rather unremarkable for something that they promote so heavily. But it was fine. \n\nDrinks were strong, atmosphere cozy, staff amazing. Loves. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You can't put lipstick on a pig to make her pretty. Same goes for this Walmart. It might have been remodeled but the people they employ has not changed. What a bunch of slackers! My son and I stood at the bakery for a good 10 mins while the ladies working there were looking through a book. I said, \""excuse me\"" several times but was ignored. We finally gave up.\n\nWent to the electronics department looking for printer ink and was completely ignored. I was told by several associates they would be right back....never came back.\n\nMade my way over to the clearance on Christmas paper etc.. It was busy (duh!), but there were associates pushing through people to stock merchandise on the shelves. I get they need to restock, but the shelves were full! Not to mention packed with people. Then they would sit there and huff and puff that they couldn't get their job done. \n\nFinally get to the register (there were 3 open, the day after xmas). Was able to pay fairly quickly considering the cashier was also a manager that was getting called away every 5 seconds.\n\nI HATE this Walmart and I would rather pay double somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hubby and I really enjoyed this place. We will definately be going back. The menu looks rather limited, but everything we ordered was amazing.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yesterday I was downtown & hungry, so I dropped in here, my first dining experience at a Scholtzsky's, & I ordered a medium Pastrami & Swiss on rye.  The bread looked like a big round chocolate cookie, but had a rather normal taste, not even particularly \""rye\"",  The pastrami was lean, tender, & didn't have any gristle, but it was smallish, & the sandwich alone was over $7 with the tax.  I'm a soup lover, & they had some soup there, but it was around $3.50 for a small bowl, so I passed.  The restaurant itself was comfortable & appropriate... built up to take you back to the 1950s.\n\nIn my view, with these reviews, it's all about comparison.  I don't usually review non-buffet restaurants, but there was such a contrast between Schlotzsky's yesterday & the place where I ate today, I just had to write!\n\nI was over at Wal*Mart in Laveen for a few things.  You could smell the fresh bread baking at the Subway right there inside & it made me hungry, so I dropped in & I ordered a sandwich there comparable to the one I ate yesterday at Schlotzsky's, plus a bowl of Cream of Broccoli soup.  My 6\"" sub, plus the fairly good-sized bowl of soup cost about half as much as the competitive sandwich alone at Schlotzsky's!  BOTH were $4.33 TOTAL!  (I'm not mistaken;  I have the receipt right in front of me as I'm typing!)  Not only that, the Subway sandwich beat Schlotzsky's hands down even without the soup!  It had much more on it, & was really good.  Then, there was ALSO the Cream of Broccoli soup, nice & hot, & delicious!\n\nBottom line:  Subway amounts to the same kind of restaurant, but is genuinely better than Schlotzski's, where nothing about it is bad, just not as good...  2-Stars not as good!\n\n10/18/09 Update - Today I tried Scott's Generations.

Now this review isn't about the show we saw, but more on the venue. \n\nI have lived in the valley for 13 years and never knew this place existed, crazy right?\n\nWe arrived an hour early so we went down into the club area and son in law & I had some drinks, this is a cool little waiting spot, it did fill up quickly, but didn't feel over crowded. \n\nThen the doors opened, and I have to say, I enjoyed the set up, we were only 6 rows back from the stage, but after looking around I can't honestly say there isn't a bad seat in the house, and this is a smaller more intimate venue where the stage turns, so everyone can get a great view.  \n\nThe seats were comfortable, the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Fate, and have been there dozens of times. I agree with a lot of reviewers about the attitudes from the girls who work there. They act as though you are a bother. I can't understand why someone would work a job they hate. The food though, is incredibly tasty, and has plenty of options for vegitarians and carnivores. I like the hipster atmosphere and the food a ton. The drinks are weak, and overpriced, but the food reasonable. This translates over to next door where they charge 9 bucks for a well drink. They also treat you like scum. I'm only giving this restaurant a 4 because I pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than I do service. I also love the fact they are open late. I work til 10pm most nights so its good to have an option that isn't fast food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They close at 8 but will serve the person in front of you if they know them and the doors are unlocked at 8:30. Oh, and while the place is packed and you're not the only on in live willing to pay. A+ customer service. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Impossible to park. (Small lot and a helluva walk from non-permit streets. No meters: it's Phoenix.)\n\nDecent food and drinks.\n\nService can be OK...or towards the rude/don't care side. Depends on who is serving. A very young staff will often yield this result.\n\nToo many employees behind the main counter not doing anything. Not a manager-heavy environment.\n\nONE employee at the coffee bar making espresso-based drinks; a counter which is usually backlogged.\n\nToo much crap/displays littering the register/order area. Confusing layout, no signage and no line ropes to help form orderly queues.\n\nSeating area tables and chairs (in the big room with the grills) often not properly wiped down; crumby.\n\nAn expensive-ish modern American/gastro-pizza pub-ish menu.\n\nDessert case = a step above Fry's/store-bought.\n\nMostly a scene. Not about a quality dining experience.\n\nPeople go here mainly to say \""Let's go to LGO!\"" I'm convinced if it wasn't for the snappy acronym, business would drop 39%.\n\nSuper-fancy building exterior and interior decorating though!\n\nNo thanks. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  $200 after a 50% off sale for a plastic pair of glasses without nosepieces! How times have changed. \n\nI'm not trendy or fashionable, so I really had no clue what I was looking for when I walked in this store. That all changed when I found out I only had 5 choices under $110 for the frames alone (buried on the last display case facing away from the door). Nonetheless, I have a fat face. Let's be honest - most days it looks like an overgrown apple growing from my body. Apparently, there are frame shapes meant for fat faces (i.e., rectangular). I spent a good 15 minutes looking at all of the glasses and, of course, did not get a rectangular frame -- primarily because in that entire 15 minutes, not one of the ten employees in the room offered assistance or guidance or anything. I was then told to \""have a seat\"" on an ungodly uncomfortable backless bench to be fitted by a worker. This wait was 30 minutes - and there was only 1 person in front of me. Not a happy girl here. The chick worker (very nice) was not clear about their offers, prices, lens benefits, or frame choices/differences. In fact, I felt like I was forcing her to give secret information when I asked about scratch resistance, UV ray blockage, and price, etc.\n\nIf you know what you're looking for and you memorize their website, this would be a fine store to shop, but you will not find a decent frame for under $170, and the 4 lenses on the website are apparently not available with all frames, because I only had 2 choices ($120 featherwates or $180 featherwates plus). Employees are not helpful, but there is a receipt book that they give you at the end of the purchase that tells you about  frame choices (i.e., after you buy your non-rectangular frames for your fat face, they tell you not to do that). You could ask for this up-front because there's nothing but posters of pretty people with pro-youth slogans all over the store.\n\nWould not do again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I almost gave this place 1 star, but hey the owners were very nice and cute so I can't do that reason as ratings need to be holistic. My friend was really craving Caribbean food so I did research on yelp and decided on this place because of the high rating. I was SOOO very disappointed. First of all, LACK OF selections, maybe this is an American thing to want to have a couple more options, but to be fair, you can see the menu that is listed under the photos section here, you get like 3 choices. I got the vegetarian platter as well, maybe that's why it's not very good. But I always prefer vegetarian and I've had MUCH MUCH better food elsewhere. I got some kidney beans mixed in with my rice...I feel like I could have cooked myself this with a can of beans dumped into my rice? On top of the kidney beans the veggie platter also comes with string beans...ok they are the best on the my plate. And then it was another selection of veggie that I am not quite sure what it is but this place kinda just reminds me of badly cooked southern food to be honest. But hey, I am going to go back and maybe give it another try on the meat product. As far as veggies goes, not tasty is for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  At the CLT location counter we were offered an upgrade (we had reserved a premium car, which was going to be a Ford Taurus, not sure that this is considered \""premium\"")however, we took the upgrade for a week rental to an Infiniti SUV (there were 4 of us).  My rental costs were almost $1000 for the week and the car was the biggest disappointment piece of junk for the price.  The interior was dirty, there were knobs broken off for accessories (such as heated seats that didn't work) and the vehicle itself had no power and was awful (not National's fault, it's the Manufacturer).  I always rent from this location and spend quite a bit however this time I was very disappointed and may rethink where we get our rentals. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was expecting nothing special from this place, but I will say that the sandwiches were far better than that and the mashed potatoes and fries were wonderful! Mixed with a bit of horseradish, the mashed potatoes were among the best I've had (aside from my own). The fries were fresh, golden, and crispy.\n\nMy only gripe is that the sandwich I ordered wasn't as requested, but still tasty. The cheese used was lower quality, so it didn't sit very well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've ordered their pad thai for take out a couple of times from this place, but last night was the first night that my husband and I decided to go dine in at this place. It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The service here is HORRIBLE!! \n\nWe went there around 9pm and was the only couple there besides another group at the place. The other group left shortly after we came, but we never got service after we received our food. We never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill. They had 6 staff walking around working and doing their own thing and NOT ONE of them ever even stop to come check on us especially our waitress. When we finally got up to leave she was talking out loud from the far back asking us if everything was okay. I wanted to throw a fit and say.. \""no, everything is not okay we got no service!\"" \n\nAside from the poor customer service; we ordered my favorite dish which was the pad thai. I asked for no onions and bean sprouts, but we still got it with LOTS of big onions and bean sprouts. My husband told me to say something about it; but I figure I would deal w/ it because I'm always iffy about what people do with my food after they take it back and have to fix it for me. It already took about 15 minutes or so for them to bring out the dish and I didn't want to have to wait another 15 minutes. \n\nWe also ordered sticky rice..and I LOVE sticky rice. It took them longer to bring us the sticky rice than the other three dishes that we ordered. The sticky rice was not moist and sticky at all. It was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long. I guess they were trying to microwave or steam it before they brought it out, but didn't do a very good job.\n\nWe also ordered the green curry dish; that dish cost $13.95 and came in such a small size plate that should have been worth $7 at the most! Big disappointment on that dish. \n\nSo base on my experience last night; I have concluded that I will NEVER go here again nor will I even bother to order take out from this place. Bangkok Ocha down the street is so much better! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent service and food.   Black ink pasta with seafood is delicious.  Try the mozzarella with tomatoes.  Parking can be a little challenging but there are valet options close. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My daughter and I frequent this place.  I am addicted to their veggie burrito and E is addicted to their cheese crisp.  It really is fresh and simple meixcan food.  I also like their chips and salsa.  Good price, good food, good service...this is what keeps us going back <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is nasty, the spring roll tasted liked it had been frozen for 50 years.  The  beef broccoli tasted like  dead cats.  The shrimp was stinky, like it was not washed, the chicken strips were tiny and had no flavor at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I work nearby so I was hoping for the best. \n\nUncomfortable bench seating.\n\nBizarre order at the front protocol.\n\nThe place smelled like old people and looked dirty and unkempt so I knew off the bat that I wouldn't order any raw fish.\n\nIf I could give zero stars, I would. \n\nThe shrimp tempura roll was somehow gross due to the rice not being cooked right and the crab tasting fishy. Yech \n\nThe Pad Thai was downright DISGUSTING.\n\nI'm\nNot sure why. Too much fish sauce? COLD TOFU on top that exploded with cold water when you take a bite. (SO freaking gross.). The shrimp tasted freezer burned. I didn't eat it and they didn't charge me thank god.\n\nOh boy. This place is bad. I feel bad for the nice guy who took my order. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We live by MOTO so we are kinda stuck when it comes to sushi establishments. The sushi blows. You can tell it isn't fresh fish and never taste super. The Mojo & beers are the only good things. I don't really trust a sushi place that hides the sushi makers in the kitchen...stuff probably looks like week old shit which it is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love, love, love this place! If I had lots of money to spend I would have my whole house done in world market products! All their products are so unique! The layout is very nice and the people are super friendly and helpful! I just have to say it once more I love this place and could spend hours here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have a dream. A dream that some day the North Shore will have a ton of amazing food options. I hope one day it will become a reality. For now, I think there's a smattering of okay-ish places and a lot of mediocrity. \n\nMaybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. \n\nI stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...\n\nThe menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my \""main course.\"" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.\n\nThe pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked, but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service, small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I get really annoyed with these \""fancy\"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  \n\nAlso, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThere's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.\n\nThe room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Loved it!\n\nI know NOTHING about go karting, cars, engines but my boyfriend who loves stuff like that brought me here for date night. We came around 10:45pm on Friday night. They had a running special so the boyfriend paid full price and my cost of entry was only $5. The workers were EXTREMELY helpful. Since we came so late, we were the only people there (excluding the group at the food area) so we had the track for ourselves. \n\nOne thing I really like is that you sign up and register upon entry and they automatically send you your race times and place number to your email along with giving you a print out. \n\nI had the best date night ever coming here. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Coventry Motors is the real deal. If you have a problem with any british and/or german make cars (especially vintage models) this is the place to go! Tim & Co. are very friendly, inviting, and honest. Whether you want to drop it off and not think about it or hang out and see the guts of your car you will be in good hands. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had the worst Italian food ever....... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The best thing about this meal was the view.  Because we had a voucher, we (along with many others) were put in a separate room with the tables and chairs they use for their events (weddings, etc).  It was a very limited menu and small portions.  The food was average at best, not super flavorful.  Our waiter was nice and the service was good....maybe a tad too quick.  We were thinking it was like the food was prepared like it was for catering and plates were made it advance.  The atmosphere was nice but I'm pretty sure we are not going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\n\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\n\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\n\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \n\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So you're with a bunch of people who like chicken fried steak, and they say, hey theres this steak house you should try with us. This should be your first warning. If a steak house is known for its chicken fried steak, something is not right.\n\nMaybe you're different, maybe you think, sure, they like chicken fried steak, and I like fried asshole. Then this is your place!\n\nNow, you go in, and ahh the ambiance, shit on the walls as far as the eye can see, oh and not just the walls, the ceiling as well! Its jam packed, you can't hear the person in front of you, you're thinking, when's the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans. \n\nIts hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that true texas experience?\n\nSo you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you're at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.\n\nThe okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.\n\nHey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.\n\nNow your entree comes, but the waitress, if you're lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!\n\nOh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!\n\nSo you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink. And those extra plates, well if they're really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them, though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe (or eat what you just did). \n\nNow you're full, you've paid, and because of its \""prime\"" location, you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street. \n\nMight as well just wait to get home to pee too, its sweltering in there, more crap on the walls and ceiling, and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dont' mind me... I'm just practicing for when I don't remember stuff. Like two weeks ago when I stayed here for three days? I was surfing the Pittsburgh yelp pages, and knowing I had to return to Pittsburgh next week for software training, decided to \""check out the hotel\"" that we'd be staying at for four days. When I got to the review page for this Radisson, it hit me....... \""Been there, done that.\""\n\nShort opinion here. Being a native SoCal person, I benefit from a great choice of hotels, throughout the Western states. So for years, when I've had to go back East, I prepare myself for older properties, musty rooms, and usually....... older bathroom fixtures, accompanied by really aged tile grout! If any of the above rings a bell...... you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt's really not that bad, but we West coasters are a bit spoiled. They do have a decent bar-restaurant. But as others have mentioned, this property exists on multiple levels. For instance...... the parking lot in the back? You get off the elevator on the 5th floor. If you're going to the bar, THEN you hit \""Lobby\"" and end up at the bottom of the hillside, which is still elevated above the access road. Sounds a bit convuluted, but it's not that bad. I think I just like to complain a bit....... you get that way after your 39th birthday.   :-) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money, this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I only gave them one star because it may look like I just didn't rate them if I left it at 0. WORST PLACE EVER!! I was told by a rude salesperson and an even more rude manager that I did not qualify for the 04 ford expedition I went to see before I was even given an opportunity to test drive. After leaving highly upset I stopped down the road at City Chevrolet where I was greeted by a courteous sales professional by the name of Avon Spann \""THE CHEVY MANN\"". Not only did he get me in a 2014 vehicle which I didn't qualify for as far as ford was concerned. But he treated me so well I don't want to buy cars from anyone or anywhere else. Even if you want a Ford still go see The CHEVY MANN @ City Chevrolet. He'll get you anything you ask for. My brother is working with him to buy a BMW that is in Tallahassee, FL <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of my favorite coffee places in Pittsburgh. THey also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food. Otherwise, they have plenty of pasteries/cookies to eat that are pretty good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food and service.  Thanks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After reading some less than flattering reviews of Carolina's, I thought I would come to the defense of this iconic Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix, named after the kind owner. You see, I was craving some good Mexican after this bowl of cheap ice cream I just had for dinner (don't ask), and harkened back to a time when I'd frequent Carolina's while working in Phoenix in the 90's. \n\nI think I have the bad reviews figured out, save for the gal whose rear end turned into a fire hose: The people were SCARED of the place, the area, everything. Yes, Carolina's is what you would call a dive, with a capital D. And, it is in the HOOD. I mean no disrespect by that, it's just what it is. When you consider the whole package- the neighborhood, the building, signage, interior, etc. it could definitely put some people off who are not used to such a thing. I mean, I understand, because I'm a guy, I'm not small, and the first time I went there I thought I'd be gunned down or kidnapped by MS-13 or something. Seriously, driving there I was aghast as I had never seen people in the US living in 40 year old, busted up cabover campers sitting on the dirt, with plywood shacks surrounding them. Not kidding.\n\nBut the food, the handmade flour tortillas, it's divine. When somebody cries that their soft taco just didn't hit the spot, I wonder WTF they were expecting. Maybe Taco Bell? How about get an imagination and order the Machaca Beef and Bean Burro and turn into an absolute wild animal because you can't eat it fast enough? That's what I'm talking about. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered the dumplings and pineapple fried rice.I've never had fried rice that was so white-It lacked flavor. The dumplings were just okay. I don't think I will come back here for Chinese food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place reminds me of my Grandma's cooking...and my grandma can't cook.  We had the beef steak, fried chicken, and ham and beans.  It was all pretty mediocre and not worth repeating.  Even the apple dumplings were just okay.  Too bad...guess if I want a decent home style meal I will have to do it myself.  \n\nWe are also a mixed family and didn't feel uncomfortable eating at this place as others have mentioned. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pane Bianco is a refreshing breath of air.\n\nAfter having a bad experience at Pizzeria Bianco, I was pretty hesitant to try Pane. My husband talked me into going, and I'm really glad that he did. Restaurant is located next to Lux, so parking is shared (either the small lot next to/behind the building or along the street).\n\nI really like the decor. The seating is mostly large tables with chairs and benches. It's dimly lit, with a small bar and a separate to-go section. Menu is small but sufficient and good. I like that you can order a pizza in addition to trying something a little different from Pizzeria.\n\nEggplant parmigiana is lovely. It's small but rich, with a wonderfully crisp topping and rich eggplant inside. I like that it isn't bogged down in marinara and cheese. The honey lemon chicken is amazing. The chicken is extremely tender, and the accompanying apple slaw and potato salad are refreshing and delicious. The plating is very rustic, which I like.\n\nService was good. We had a great time. I can't wait to stop in and try lunch sometime. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In the time I've been living on the road I have never had a worse experience.  Bad service, rude desk clerks, terrible management!  Waiting outside our doors at 9 am to get out when checkout is 11.  I would not suggest this hotel to anyone staying in the Charlotte area! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is by far one of my favorite live music venues in the Queen City.\nWhat I love most is you can sit or stand and see the entire stage even being short like myself.  The drinks are priced right and the service is friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wonderful. My girlfriend had to pick up her new glasses from them and they were really great. They greeted us as soon as we walked in and were very polite. The woman behind the counter was helpful and made sure the glasses fit exactly right. She even complimented my girlfriend on her selection which really made me smile. All in all, great experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The hubby and I are currently in the process of moving to Phoenix so trying to find some of the things that we love back home pizzas one of them we are both in the service industry husband is a restaurant manager we both believe that good service is just as important as good food. NYPD pizza has both I looked at a few other pizza restaurants before ordering from here. The other places got good food marks but bad service reviews we are currently staying in a hotel in unfamiliar with the area in the process of ordering online by the way very convenient and easy I called the restaurant to ask a question about an item Leo answered the phone very friendly great service after placing my order within a few minutes the manager from the restaurant called me because he was unsure about an ad on that I had and wanted to confirm he had it correct. to me that goes above and beyond instead of just assuming you called me to check it out the food was delivered within the 60 minute time frame I was given the driver was very friendly and most importantly had change we ordered pizza salad zucchini sticks and cannolis all in all after tip $42 yes a little pricey but great service and amazing food. you definitely get what you pay for here very much pleased and looking forward to ordering again thank you in YPD pizza for a great experience in Phoenix <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Insanity!  Overcrowding!  Being on one side of the Southwest terminal and then to run your ass to the otherside to make your connecting flight in what seems like a mile away at the otherside of the terminal.  (It is set up like a giant U.  So it is quite the jog).\n\nThe food places in here stink, the bathrooms are cramped and there are not enough seats for everyone waiting for their flight.  \n\nIn short, this airport stinks.  The only saving grace is the quality customer service from the employees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't know what it is about this place. It smells like my Grandma's closet, the clientele are questionable and none of it makes a bit of damned sense why I keep returning. Besides their beer selection putting a twinkle in my eye and the menu making my heart stop. I find it endearing to post up and get crunk on the patio overlooking Central Ave.\n\nI took a first date here, she enjoyed herself and I got a goodnight kiss that night. He shoots, he scores! Maybe it was just the booze talking.\n\nNevertheless, it's definitely my default. Since its within walking distance, \""G&D\"" is sent in a mass text message on any of the 6 nights I drink. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A very meh airport. I recently had to make two layovers here and I've got to say, it's not a great layover airport. Horrible food options and very few of them within reasonable walking distance so if you don't have alot of time, you're screwed. One of the most miserable things here was the lack of seating and overall cramped atmosphere in the gate areas. They cramp a dozen gates in a small area and it's a mess. Lines for different flights intertwining and the like. \n\nThe disorganization mixed with flight delays just made for a very stressful flight. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've only been here once, but thought I'd share after reading some other reviews. \n\nFirst off, this is NOT TexMex. I'm not sure what I would classify it as, maybe AmeriMex, but definitely NOT TexMex. \n\nNow that I have that out of the way, I'll say that I like El Cancun. \n\nI do not like this El Cancun. \n\nWhile it looks decent on the outside and the inside, the food and service were simply terrible. Chicken was very watered down, the salsa was flavorless, and the service make a fast food chain look really good. Just a poor, poor experience at this location overall. If this was the only El Cancun in Charlotte, I would feel the same way many posters do and just never come back. \n\nLuckily for me, I live in Rock Hill. There's an El Cancun here. And it's pretty awesome. I won't give it a full on review because this isn't really the place for it, but suffice it to say that if you're in RH and you see the El Cancun and you go \""ugh, no way that place is terrible\"" don't put your experience with the really shitty location on to the one in Rock Hill and give the other one a chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio, which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as \""all you can eat\"".  The staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  If I wanted \""all you can eat\"" I would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  The pasta was cold when served.  The frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  I would not recommend nor would I ever return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was my first time going to this salon. I found a groupon for it and decided to try it out. When I first arrived I didn't really think much of it. The outside was just a normal looking store. However, once I entered I was instantly impressed. Everything was so chic and clean. I loved the atmosphere. Katie cut my hair and she was fantastic! She made me feel totally comfortable and was super kind. I totally recommend everyone to go here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I visited the Arizona Science Center two weeks ago on a Saturday to use a Groupon for the DaVinci exhibit. We like museums. So why only two stars? \n\nParking was confusing. Apparently you can get parking validated if you park in a specific lot, but there weren't signs or directions to let us know that. We parked across the street next to the Diamondbacks stadium for not an obscene amount of money, but considering we are in Phoenix and not San Francisco, it was excessive. Plus there was some other event going on so we had to drive up several floors and there were annoying cones blocking off most of the available parking. WTF! \n\nThen we got to the lobby. The line was waaayyyy worse than the MVD. And the lobby is also pure concrete (think bomb shelter), so if you're trying to pull up a Groupon or something on your phone... give up. The cashier was kind enough to pull up our Groupons on her computer. The line was also complete with more than its fair share of impatient, screaming children who needed their naps. \n\nThe actual exhibit was interesting. The only way to get from the ticket counter to the exhibit was a small, slow, in-the-corner elevator. We looked through a few of the permanent exhibits, and it was ok, but nothing special. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 200th review!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nFriend and I were headed out to paint the town red and run amuck and we met up with some other friends in north phoenix down at the Whisky River, now I have never been and let's just say I'm more of an RNB kinda girl but with that said, I did find myself having fun, no cover charge before 9 and well drinks 50cents till 11, now this place is alright with me! haha\n\nPeople were friendly, bartenders & staff were nice, and dance floor was wooden and round had folks dancing and having a good time. \n\nI'm going to be honest, I dug the 50cent drinks, drank me some whiskey and coke all night long, well at least to 11. Had a great group of girlfriends and just a great time! \n\nIsn't it funny how once you start drinking someone in the group says Hey lets go somewhere else and see what's up!  I know the DD's that night got some miles on their car LOL,,,so we went off to our next spot! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Yeah, I know that everyone has wrote a review about this place\n\nIt took me a while to get up to try this quaint little gem out, but it was well worth the wait. I went up on Sunday afternoon (12/1/08) for brunch with my friend Jamie. Both of us we pleasantly surprised on the nice little location on the corner and little picnic style table outside. \n\nFirst we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks. \n\nFor how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!) \n\nWhile we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more. After grabbing the sandwiches and taking them outside to share a picnic table with some strangers, we devoured our orders and sipped out coffees. \n\nI was very impressed with the style and uniqueness of this quaint little gem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Over a year later I still give this place 5 stars.  Their crab cakes are amazing!  My boss took me to lunch and I suggested this place.  He's from Maryland so he loved that they use Maryland crab.  \n\nOne bit of warning - the bowl of clam chowder is HUGE!  It could be a meal by itself.  I recommend sharing with a friend or order a cup instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I feel bad for this place, I just ate a chicken bowl and my stomach is gurgling, not a good sign. When i was here 5 years ago, the food was great. Now its basically teriyaki bowls and sushi. Things are more expensive now, rivalling Stingray, which is worth the price. The atmosphere is cluttered with obnoxious signs everywhere in bright colors, the menu is glued to the counter with plastic covering it. I felt like i was in Tijuana! The counter help even called my order to the kitchen in Spanish! Not a good sign. There were also three TV's with three different things playing...At least they have China Mist tea. It is the only thing worth ordering, sorry to say. <|endoftext|>

Now I need to contact yelp find out what is happening to my reviews.\n\nDepending on what time of day you shop here, you will always be lucky enough to find day laborers loitering at the entrance. You'll know your shopping experience is complete when you return to your car to find someone begging for spare change \""to catch the bus\"". <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place! It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, definitely the best Italian in town I've had. Everything is so fresh, made from scratch and delicious; I love their homemade pasta! They also offer gluten-fee pasta, which I greatly appreciate. Yum! The service is also very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.\n\nI'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can! <|endoftext|>

I've been coming here for 5 years (which makes me a newbie) and while at first I thought the burros were a bit off in the red chile/tortilla ratio, you won't forget the flavor of the red chile. One morning, you'll wake up after a night of too much fun and CRAVE Rito's.\n\nFamily owned and operated this little gem is worth the weight (and wait) in gold. Just don't forget...cash only! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to be a huge huge fan of this place.  But, recently they seem to have quality control issues.  One issue has been the bread---which used to be nothing short of awesome.  One a couple of recent visits (off the lunch time rush) the bread tasted like it had been sitting around (in one case, the sandwich was inedible).  A second issue has been seasoning, which used to be perfect.  In one case, the sandwich lacked any taste and in another case, the moz was unevenly salted.  All of these are \""sins\"" that are excusable from an ordinary sandwich shop with ordinary prices.  (Well, the inedible sandwich isn't excusable...)  But, I expect much better from PB. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's not the end-all, be-all of awful...but it's sub-par.  Perhaps it's just the experiences I've had there (experiences unrelated to the bar itself) that make the bile rise in my throat when its name is mentioned.  In any case, it's a wood-paneled, dank bar with green and yellow Green Bay Packers curtains.  Do you really need to know any more about it? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK, update time.  Sushi we split was good.  Miso soup had an odd taste this visit.\nMy main course (Butaniku) was unforgettable, a real meh!  Not sure what happened this night.  \n\nOur waitress was MIA most of the night.  Could not even find her to try to get refills, desert or our check.  \n\nMust have been an off night for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ok... Let me lay it out straight first...  I can't justify spending the money on running shoes that I would spend to get shoes here... However, I will admit, having no clue what kind of shoes I needed I went in to gain some pointers. \n\nKnowing full well that I was not going to purchase anything, the staff here..especially one particularly handsome gent..was more than willing to help me try on a variety of shoes to see what was best for my feet and activity style.  This was exceptionally impressive for me.\n\nIf I knew that I was going to commit to running long enough to spend the money at Runner's Den then I Definitely would be back to this neighborhood staple.  Their customer service and know how has won me over! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The Jackie Evancho promotors should be strung up for putting her in this filthy dump of a theatre.  Got an email ahead of performance today reminding us to allow time to be searched.  Really.  The Pearl & ascot crowd being searched!  For Jackie Evancho!  Saw BB King here.    Everyone was smoking e cigs.  Place was filled with smoke.  Wonderful.  Obviously terribly managed ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My connecting flight back to San Francisco was at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport which was cool because my walk to the terminal was less than 2 minutes and the airport was really clean. I still prefer Texas connecting flights since flying across from East coast to West isn't fun. I hate sitting on a plane for more than a few hours but as long I reached my destination I'm good and on time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted. The best swordfish I have ever tasted. The chicken was incredibly juicy, the swordfish perfectly flakey. Get dressed up, the atmosphere is elegant with a massive patio that seamlessly melds into the dinning room. Bravo! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disclaimer: I had a terrible experience with a stylist here, but will make an attempt to keep my venom from poisoning the rest of the review. It has been about two months since my visit, and  I can now look in the mirror without seething so I thought it was time to put it on record. Here goes...\n\nThe Digs: Salon Boulevard is in a convenient spot for Phoenicians in the Moon Valley area, located in the LA Fitness complex right next to Half Moon Bar & Grill. The interior itself is on the smallish side and what you might typically expect from a strip-mall salon.\n\nThe Walk-in: Feeling a bit lackluster after a bout of Pilates, I decided a trim was just the thing to put some bounce back into my locks - lo and behold! There was Boulevard Salon and their\"" Walk-ins Welcome\"" sign. Serendipity.\n\nThe front desk person was very busy, but friendly, and said she could get me in with a stylist in 15 minutes whose price would be $35 for a trim. Sweet! She asked if she could bring me some coffee and invited me to have a seat. After about 10 minutes and no cafe au lait, I simply got up and served myself. Not a moment later, Ms. X fetched me for my cut.\n\nShe took my cup, set it at her station, and immediately led me to the sinks and began shampooing without even looking at my hair while it was dry or asking what I wanted. Back at her station, I told her I just wanted a trim and my side-swept bangs maintained, to which she replied \""Yes, yes, something plain. I see you are a plain girl.\"" Um...ok, lady.\n\nTo make a long story short, Ms. X spilled my coffee on me, dabbed ferociously at my crotch, yammered ceaselessly without ever waiting for a response, then gave me a whole new hairstyle of her choosing that was some sort of long bob with butchered bangs that ended up too uneven to do anything with but pin back. And the icing? She wanted $5 more to blow dry. \n\nSince I left \""wet\"" I didn't realize the extent of the devastation until I returned home to dry and style. I'm ashamed to say I even thanked her for the mutilation of my head. And tipped. *sigh*. \n\nThe other clientele seemed smiley and unaccosted. At the time of my visit, it was mostly older ladies getting their curls set under the dryers, though I believe they are a full-service salon and offer several waxing and nail treatments as well.\n\nThe Resolution: In the end, I did call Ms. X back that day on her cell and left a message explaining that I would not be returning to the salon and why. I regret not speaking to a manager to give the business a chance to make amends. As it is, I do not plan to return. I even park as far away from the place as possible when going to the gym. And I'm still waiting for one side of my bangs to grow back long enough to get them fixed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place was my favorite BBQ in the past. However, now all menu items are smaller, the prices are higher and the sauce is lower quality. I believe smokey Jon can make an award winning sauce but he's not bringing it here. The sides are always top notch the meat is alright but made to be drenched in BBQ, kind of plain alone. All around too expensive for the portion size and used to be a lot higher quality. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  On a unseasonably warm February evening, hubs and I ventured out for some eats. Since we both had fairly light lunches we were starvin' marvins. After attempting to stop by a handful of places (closed on Monday or an hour long wait) we settled on Snoop's, hopin' for a hot and fresh burger. \n\nInside, Snoop's leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not a dull knife in the drawer, and it took me a little while to figure out the, um, theme of the burger joint. Snoop's...as in detectives...snooping...i saw a Bond poster too. Ok, sure...I didn't really care about the overall ambiance as long as the food was solid. \n\nAnd how about the food? Well, it's pricier than other old school grilles - to the tune of $15+ for two 1/3 lb. burger combos and a corn dog. This wouldn't really bother me much if the food was better. The burger was fine - passable, but very well done (as in quite brown) and essentially flavorless. Onion rings were clunk-ily breaded and with little flavor and fries were \""meh\"" overall. I was looking for the salty little slivers of love with some crisp! \n\nService wasn't super inviting and the cash register attendant didn't even hint at a smile when we ordered. As soon as cash was in hand, she went back to her computer - adjacent to the counter. With a sanitation score barely above 90 and the flavorless eats, I have indeed experienced some better burger joints in the QC. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Oh @SouperSalad, for nearly $10, you can include a drink in the meal.\n\nI enjoy the food, and the selection. I will probably return from time to time, because it's close, and it's a decent price for the kids, who can have water.\n\nBut really, I don't think the soda should be an additional cost. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Saw Louis CK on Friday night. I got there an hour early as advised by people here and parked in the west lot right in front of the exit gate. The first thing I noticed is that there were at least two ways to enter the building, which was nice as the lines to get in were short. Once inside I noticed how small the venue was which was nice, as every seat in the house was good. Yes, the seats are fairly small and the legroom wasn't great, but that didn't really take much away from the experience. The stage didn't revolve as was mentioned but Louis walked around so he was facing me much of the time it seemed...maybe cause the HBO cameras were near where I was sitting. After the show I walked to my car and was out of the lot immediately. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Charles, thank you for staying with my girlfriend and I after closing when we ran in for a Sedona guidebook 5 minutes before closing because REI didn't have what we were looking for and we had to race across town to get to you before you closed and thank you for opening a few minutes early a few days later when we came back before opening to get more climbing guides for Queen Creek. \n\nThis is the go to shop for climbing 411, guides and gear in Phoenix. Forget REI the Arizona hiking shack has caring, engaged and knowledgeable employees(shout out to the other so cal dude that works there. I forgot his name) As for the depth of their climbing 411 this is THE place for the $5 local detailed climbing guides. They are a fantastic resource! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Absolutely the worst service I have even had in my entire life.  I recently moved here from out of state and was referred to Dr. O'Clair by a coworker.  On my way to the appointment, my GPS took me in a round about way and I knew I would be late so I called ahead. The staff told me that it was not a problem.  I finally got to the office at 4:15 and was asked to sit down. After waiting for another 10 minutes, I was called up to the desk and told that I was MORE than 15 minutes late and had to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was at 4:00, so apparently they cannot tell time.  I explained that I called ahead, got lost and that I was a student who also worked part time so it was very hard for me to reschedule and  the doctor actually refused to see me. The staff was incredibly rude and should have told me not to come in the first place. I left the office in tears out of frustration and embarrassment from the way I was treated. It is clear that Dr. O'Clair has no respect for her patients...as if we have never waited 15 minutes for a doctor before. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Are you the type of person that requires being seen in an expensive, overly pretentious restaurant so that you can wear it as a status symbol?  Or maybe you're a gansta who dresses like CiLo Green and wants to show the hunny's (yes, a group of them out with one man) a night on the town.  Or maybe you are a group of ladies who can't figure out why the Bravo TV Channel passed Charlotte over for the next cast of Real Housewives?  If you fall into any of these three categories, this is the joint for you.\n\nIn all honesty, I have seen all three scenarios mentioned above play out during each of the three times I've been to this restaurant (as for the third scenario, there must have been a Real Housewives convention or something in town...there were no fewer than 5 tables of cougars decked to the 9's trying to impress SOMEone....)\n\nThe food is good, not great.  Their steaks are great cuts of meat, but I can get their roasted chicken off the rotisserie at Harris Teeter, and their fish is always dry.  I won't harp on their oysters, as it was out-of-season when I got them, and that's not a fair shake, but still....No Bueno.  Go for the top tier steak...steer clear of apps. and other proteins.\n\nThe service, managers, and hostesses here are all as pretentious as the surroundings.  Funny story; my friends got turned away due to the places dress code.  They weren't given that reason, but come on...they walked into an empty restaurant, were given elevator eyes by the hostess, and were told that all the empty tables had \""reservations attached to them\"".  And we are not talking bums off the street here...this was a Brooks Brothers and TRCW wearin' couple!  Bottom line...leave the jeans at home for this place...may even want to throw on a jacket to improve your chances with St. Peter at the Pearly Gates...I mean, the hostess at the podium.\n\nOverall, if you feel the need to define your restaurant experience by how much you spend, and the number of \""important\"" people sitting next to you, go here.  If you want good food, and don't feel like taking out a second mortgage on your home to enjoy a nice meal, pass on this one.  As far as high-end steakhouses go, might I suggest Ruth's Chris (right down the street) or Del Friscos (South Park) as better alternatives to this place?  Del Frisco's is my personal choice, due to the fact that I always see Ric Flair here, and he entertains me...WOOOOO! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \n\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \n\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> How could someone walk in this place and not have a great experience. I value my expensive Italian shoes and when the leather starts to crack and they are in need of a pro job count on this place. I just reviewed a nightmare shoe shop about a month ago down the street. This place puts the other place to shame. This shoe shop is run by authentic Italians that work hard and deserve more than their underpriced work. Thank G-d I finally found a proper shoe repair and shine store that I can count on doing not only a fantastic job but not ripping me off. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to love this place. It all went down the past few weeks. The food quality was lacking compared to their norm. Usually I could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing. My wife was just cut from a long double. When we walked in I noticed three very young snickering girls at the bar. The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn't serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don't deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty. The biggest plus used to be fried pickles but now I just enjoy them at The Turf instead. Usually I'm not so easily offended but this was bit ridiculous. I will definitely update my review if this changes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I gave all smiles rave reviews initially but since then have had a horrible experience there.  First, they screwed up in scheduling my cleanings and much to my surprise, billed me $82.  What?  My cleanings are free!  If that is not so bad, I guess I'm just livid that I received a threatening letter in the mail saying that I had been disregarding my bills for months now and would have to pay in full.  IT WAS THE FIRST SUCH BILL I HAD RECEIVED! When I called the office they said they do the \""best they can\"" in scheduling appointments so that the insurance covers it but there are over 1100 insurance companies and they are \""not perfect\"".  Funny, I have been going to the dentist for years and have NEVER had to pay for a cleaning!  And for the nasty billing letter threatening to turn me over to collections ...  I MUST have received the other bills because they show they mailed them!   This place has gotten roughly $2000 from me in 1 year and $850 (+$82 now) out of my own pocket.  All Smiles, this is some \""thank you for your business\"".  I will never be back!  BEWARE! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Service was great. It seems like everything was marinated in oil then deep fried. Kinda turned my stomach. Then topping it all off with a chocolate and strawberry shake wasn't the smartest idea. I like how the waitresses dress in their cute 60's dresses and that the diner is in one big RV. I guess that made up for the mediocre food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After the Furniture Lounge in downtown Champaign closed, I decided to have a look at the one in Urbana last summer.  While the Champaign location had a basement full of clothing and a few furniture items, this one was almost entirely furniture and decorations, and seemed a bit more sparse in its inventory.\n\nWhile I can't complain about the quality of service or the workers here, I can say that it is entirely overpriced.  While there is a fair selection of interesting stuff, I don't feel that the prices they ask for on their furniture are reasonable, even factoring in the expensive nature of these \""vintage\"" stores.  While I went looking for paintings and other decorations for my apartment, I ended up leaving empty-handed since I couldn't stomach the prices. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Service is terrible at this location. We saw several people leave because their food was taking to long. Took forever for a server to take our order and had to wait to check out. Won't come back to this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am a longtime hooters fan, but this was the 1st. 1st and only time I've ever let a hooters place hungry. I've enclosed pictures. These were by far the smallest portions I've ever received in years. I'm dead serious 10 boneless wings (2 sauces) and 10 shrimp (Cajun) and these pictures are all I got. It feels like they cut the wings in half and then served them to me. These were appetizer portions for a full meal price? I'm extremely disappointed. So much so I asked the manager about it. All I'm getting is a shrug and a \""blame our distributor\"" reason for why the portions are so small. I'm seriously feeling like I've been cheated. For the record he offered me another order but I felt so ripped off I didn't take him up on it. I wish I had. This was really disappointing. My server was great, the beers were cold but I've never encountered such a small order masquerading as a full meal before. This wasn't okay. I think someone is cheating someone somewhere in regards to this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have gotten my nails done here a few times. Medocre work. Last time I went there they quoted me ten dollars less then what I paid. I asked for for an extra gel coat for white color and the nail girl charged me for both a full acrylic amd a gel manicure after quoting me a different price. I just paid the bill and vowed to never be back.\n I had received a reference for another nail salon and when the nails started to come off prematurely I made an apmnt.  The technician advised that I requested they use the type of nails that were actuallybused. It turns out they used the wrong size bc they were to lazy to adjust the nails correctly.  \n Extremely disappointed. I WILL NEVER be back <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you stop eating frozen custard for a while and then go back to it, you  wish you never tried it again.  After a few years frequenting this place, the Oreo malt is the only thing I consider ordering. And that is only if someone I'm with really wants to go and is paying for it. Prices are obscene. All of the food is greasy, bland, and expensive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If McDonalds is the Toyota Corolla of the fast food world, Chick-fil-A is the Rolls Royce or Range Rover.  Yes, you will pay a little bit more than the dollar menu options at McDonalds or Taco Bell, but the quality is also light years ahead.  Chick-fil-A has pioneered the chicken sandwich, and they do it better than anyone else in town... yes, even better than Bojangles.  And the Plaza location has their act together; every day, they get slammed with a hungry lunchtime crowd of bankers, Duke Energy-ers, etc, and they consistently manage to fill orders correctly, quickly, and tastily.  Their hours are a bit shortened compared to other locations, as they close at 4pm, but stop by for breakfast or lunch (or an afternoon ice dream or milkshake snack!), and you won't be disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seven fillings in three years...never before have I had my teeth drilled so much. To make matters worse, twice I had to get fillings redone because Dr. Jeffrey Collin didn't do it correctly the first time. I'm finding another place and hoping that there hasn't been irreparable damage done to my teeth. The dentist says I may need a root canal, because he's drilled down one of my teeth so far and now it's causing me pain...\n\nOn a better note, the hygienist, Mandi, is wonderful. However, for the sake of my teeth, I need to find a better dentist.\n\nOh, and the group that the other reviewer was talking about that is Heatland Dental Care, which runs a whole series of clinics, Champaign Dental included. I will avoid them all as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Do not go here. Horrible costumer service. Return policy from the dark ages...even on unopened nonpersonal item bought just hours before. Surprised they think that they can still treat people this way when there are so many other wonderful options. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wouldn't eat here if it were the last food place in Charlotte. They have burnt broccoli. They also have a lack of good customer service. Oh not to mention how slow they are when you are waiting for your order. Don't waste your time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This little place adjoins the main restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, by Chef Vincent Gerithault (sp?).  All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes.  I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is \""French country\"" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.    \n\nThe main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's true talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.\n\nOne last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I popped in one night with a date to have a drink and check the place out and was majorly underwhelmed...high drink prices ($5.00 for a coke) and the \""talent\"" left a lot top be desired. Save the time and trouble and go elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you want Mexican food this place is the perfection you're looking for. Take it from a Latina who knows even though I'm Hebrew too but my dad is from Mexico.  \n\nThis place has perfection on a plate. You don't have to be cheap here. I max out in this place because the quality is SUPREME EVERY TIME. They're very diligent in putting out the best in quality for your money EVERY TIME. I have never had a problem here but I'm very sure if you speak up they will fix it. If that should ever happen. \n\nThe beans and rice are AWESOMEEEEEE and to show you how awesome... I never go without an extra side order. YUM TO THE YUM on the beans and rice, I must be greedy here (Hahahahaha). One great thing that goes on here is the manager or owners are always visible if you know who they are. \n\nCome and eat and you will leave here happy because I always do. I love it so much I have to tell myself not to go so I won't undo my 50 pound weight loss. \n\nThe best servers in this place are Raul, Alejandra, and Favian. Please do not be afraid to mention you got their names from a food review and now you're giving them a shot personally. If you use that bit of information you will turn up the performance to enhance your experience. Trust me this stuff works. \n\nAnd if you are a humorous person choose Raul and add to your server 411 that you read he was a funny guy. And Raul will come alive in a very tasteful professional way. I say these things because I am about the experience and the food comes second to the experience. I am a service queen first and the food is second because I will not spend my money on people who are rude, unappreciative, and obscene in the food world. Why should I, there is much competition and someone else would love to take my money and give me what I pay for and what I come in for. SERVICE, SERVICE, AND THEN FOOD, but by no means does that take away the quality I expect on my plate.  \n\nThese servers give you true American service with polite and respectful smiles especially if you're nice and not a grouchy / bossy patron. They demonstrate customer service that you just do not see in Mexican places usually. Believe me because some of these places out there make me HEATED!   :-( \nSo pick based on male or female depending on what you want and they will not disappoint. Keeping in mind every great server is entitled to a mistake. They are human not God. You just ask for them by name when you ask for a table. And depending on who's working hopefully you will get one of these three. \n\nThey do have happy hour food and drinks too from 3 pm to 6 pm, Wednesday thru Friday. They are closed on Mondays and they close early Tuesday at 3pm... and the rest of the week is until about 8pm or 9pm. I'm not sure of the later hours because I do not eat that late. Any business that can pick a schedule like this proves they make money and they're putting quality on the plate or how would they survive with this kind of schedule! THINK ABOUT IT! Enjoy and if you come for the first time and leave full and happy think of me saying... \nI TOLD YOU SO.... LOL\nTHX for listening....\n\nNIA <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just went in to look for a bike to ride to school, and work, and there were about 6 or 7 guys there doing nothing; didn't offer to help me, or asked if I had any questions about the bikes. They just completely and outright ignored me like I wasn't there. Don't suggest going there if you're a woman because a guy walked in behind me and he was helped right away. If I could give 0 stars I would. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. \n\nThen you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. \n\nIf they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \""with it.\"" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mixed experience here. Had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine. We bought dessert and a coffee and headed into the wine bar. A server told us to wait for the hostess and the hostess said we made a grave error by attempting to get a table while already having food. They would have to plate the food and pour the coffee into mug since they were a full service side. And that's fine, it's just the tone she used that really set us off. She suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market. We passed and went into the market to eat and got more coffee. It worked out fine and the dessert was great. There are a lot of great items in the market that are hard to find elsewhere. <|endoftext|>

I've experienced better\"" fits perfectly. I was so excited to come eat here :( Like Los Compadres it had been on the list for a long time. A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet. This place also showed up on Chow Bella a few days ago. I was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured I was in for meh service based on what I read. Seems like I received the complete 180 of an experience.\n\nGot there about 7:30 Saturday night. The place was 65% capacity at most. This surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup. Figured I was doomed for a night of waiting. We were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5. She quickly returned with some HUGE glasses of water an a basket of chips. I was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips I had read so much about. What I got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them. I'm a good sport so I tried one of the greasy ones and all I could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way.. Blech :(\n\nThe salsa however was very tasty. The red was far from burning hot that I had read so much about. It was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things I would eat all evening. The green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well.\n\nWe ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly. We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up.\n\nFood Details:\n\nGuacamole:\nVery simple prep here. Avocado, Onion, Salt and 800lbs of tomatoes. I absolutely HATE fresh tomatoes but that's just a personal preference. The quac was fresh and tasty. There was nothing \""wrong\"" with it there's just much better at countless places.\n\nRice:\nSo far from exciting I don't specifically recall. I just remember having a bite and moving on. Was a little greasy and bland :/\n\nBeans:\nJust went I thought dinner was a complete waste I took a few bites of these and WOW! some of the best beans I've ever had. Pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares. The texture was perfect.. the flavor was perfect.. I could have been satisfied with a side of quac, couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans. Half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans. I'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean.\n\nCheese Crisp:\nNo real crisp at all. Just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease.\n\nGreen Chili Tamale:\nThe texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy. This was another \""not bad but far from great\"" items.\n\nGround Beef Taco:\nThe shell was nice and crispy and didn't taco fail. The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor.\n\nChili Relleno:\nOh man.. I've been trying to figure this one out. Terrible is the only word I have for it. There were two of them on the table and they were both the same. The batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that. They weren't greasy.. they were watery. I'm nearly positive these were made in house, frozen, and heated to order. There's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way.\n\nEnchilada:\nSuffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce. Don't get me wrong.. I like cheese but it was 10% red sauce and 90% cheese. I couldn't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good. The enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside. It was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that's how skimpy the filling was.\n\nRed Sauce:\nDon't know.. there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it.\n\n\nCould this have been an off night? I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night. Is this the worst Mexican in town? Far from it.. But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving. They are missing out on some real good food out there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is amazing. Been going to them for years! Always great food, could use some extra cleaning here and there for faster seating especially on busy nights but overall a great bang for your buck <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Previously liked this place a lot, but the last few visits have really bombed. Most recently, a couple days ago. \n\nHere's the thing, this place is currently undergoing some major construction. There are no signs indicating the place is even open, let alone where to go since the front door is basically a disaster area of blasted asphalt and bare bones concrete blocks.\n\nThat said, these folks should be thanking the HEAVENS anyone is walking into their establishment.\n\nSo my recent visit went like this: Me, my Dad and my Aunt came in for lunch. Jesus was our server. Dad asked for the mini-chimi appetizer. I order a chicken burrito with fundido and verde sauce. No beans, just rice please.\n\nDad gets a full sized chimichanga, whilst my order is not only missing verde, but the rice. My order goes back once they realize the mistake...they bring it back, only now with rice still missing. Dad meanwhile realizes he's got the wrong item too.\n\nBrought the issue up with Jesus, who is clearly irritated and has the audacity to argue that my Dad ordered from the lunch menu. Thing is, I saw him point to the chimi on the appetizer section when he ordered. Wrong answer, Jesus.\n\nService was so rude, I'd be reluctant to return to this place ever again.\n\nWord to the wise: Get the attitude in check, Jesus. Don't blame the customer for your ordering errors... especially when people like us are willing to dine in your very dusty dining room as your establishment undergoes construction. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been to this location a number of times, but I have to admit that this last visit was the best.  I was immediately greeted and brought to the appropriate section, where a friendly blue-shirted employee helped me figure out whether the \""one-size-fits-all\"" laptop power adaptor would work for my netbook.  We sadly determined it wouldn't work, and I walked towards the exit, only to be met by the same greeter.  She helpfully told me about Best Buy's parts program, expressing regret that the all-in-one solution wasn't going to work for me.  \n\nWhatever they've done here, color me impressed.  Figure out how to hang on to the management staff at this location, Best Buy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.\n\nI love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.\n\nI'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I came tonight 12/19 for fish fry, it was our first time... The service we got was the worst we both have ever experienced. It took us 30 mins to even get a menu or drink! We finally got a menu and ordered water, 5 min later a different waiter brought us water and took our order. I got salad from the salad bar it was fine, but my boyfriend got the soup which we were guessing it was clamchowder. After 15-20 min our fish arrived it took us probably 5-10 min to eat the fish we were given, we ordered all you can eat, 15 min after we finished our food a different waitress came with our bill... We were never asked if we wanted more. We told them we were not going to pay for all you can eat when we got the same amount as a regular order. After the whole experience taking over an hour and a half my boyfriend is now sick from the food, I don't think we will ever be coming back for food here again. Which is unfortunate because the fish was actually decent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had a similar experience as the previous poster except that my hygienist was very nice (Kimber).  She did have some unorthodox procedures compared to other hygienist, but I am certain they are all required by the attending dentist/group.  She was always polite and very conscious of any discomfort. \n\nDr. 'Mo' ( NKUTU-KIRUNDA, MOHAMMED ) on the other hand should be avoided when possible.  He was very unusual in his interactions and within minutes of meeting me he started a sales pitch stating that I would certainly need dentures later in life if I did not undergo his Invisalign treatment in addition to other things.  Having had braces just a few years prior he definitely was looking to sell other services.  Having been to dentists in several locations I can say that he was probably one of the worst I have encountered.  \n\nThis group specializes in cosmetic dentistry so I was not overly surprised with the sales pitches for new cancer screenings, Invisalign, and Sonicare specific tooth brushes, but was surprised at the nickle-dime approach used on some basic cleaning issues and attempting to use scare tactics like dentures to have people have additional work done.  \n\nAlso, they will charge you $15 out of pocket to apply fluoride after polishing!?  Never heard or experienced any thing like that before.  If you do go make sure you ask the hygienist or desk staff what will and will not be covered.  \n\nWill not be going back... <|endoftext|>

One of the best lunch places downtown. I love the quirkiness of the restaurant. The only reason it is not five stars is the bread is usually hard around the edges.  But don't let that keep you away..... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.  They make you show a receipt that the apartment has been \""professionally cleaned\"" when move out.  I had my neighbor clean the place as she did an exceptional job.  Because she is not a registered cleaning company, they charged me $130 for not having a registered company clean the apartment.  Also, make sure that you pay rent before the first of the month if it falls on a holiday.  They charged me $75 for not paying them on time because they were closed on the first of the month.  Because they decided to close on the first, they charged other tenants and I $75 for supposedly paying late.  Be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've rented here since 2011. When it changed from being a BRE-owned property to the current owners, nearly every aspect of living here went downhill. \n\nHere are some of the most important things you should know prior to renting here: \n\n1.) The water billing is done so that you're essentially a proportionate portion of everyone's use. So even if you're good about conserving water, you'll probably be paying more than you should be. When the new company switched to this billing system, it increased our water bill about $12-17/month, even though we're not using more water.   \n\n2.) You'll pay for gas you may or may not use. The company installed gas grills that are always in use except for during the day and when the pool is about to close. Doesn't matter if you use the barbecues or not; you're paying for them.   \n\n3.) DO NOT RENT HERE IF YOU PLAN TO TRY TO BUY A HOUSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. The lease notice has to be given 60 days in advance (not 30, as in most places). So if you get don't pre-qualified until after that point, too bad, you're paying for an empty apartment for a month if you do get a house. If you put in notice to be on the safe side and your home sale falls through, I guess you're screwed. They are totally uncompromising and unwilling to work out any kind of accommodation on this, either through pro-rating a couple of weeks or anything.   \n\nAlso, that gas bill I mentioned in #2? Prepare to pay to that until you turn in your keys.   Oddly, this policy does not apply to garage rental (which is a staggering $85/month).  \n\n4.) The billing system is inefficient and tedious. The water bill is lumped in with your rent, but you can't just make one payment online. You have to wait until you get an email from Conservice to find out how much the final balance of your rent will be...and even then, you can't just log in to the apartment's portal and see what the total rent will be; you have to add it in yourself when you set the amount to be withdrawn. Also, the new calculation increased our water bill about $13/month. Oh, and to pay online there's a \""convenience fee\"" of $2, ridiculous. We used to pay on a no-hassle auto-debit, now it's  a three-step process.   \n\n5.) Recently, the condensation pan for our air conditioner was dripping a puddle into our master bathroom. We called at around 4:30 p.m. on Friday to report this and were told it was not an emergency (so what is?) and it would be handled Monday. Well, we woke up the following night at 3 a.m. to water literally running down in a stream into the three bowls we had to put down to catch the leak. Called the emergency maintenance number and received a call back from the maintenance technician, who said he'd be there....Monday morning.   Which he was. With a temporary fix, that basically caused the leaking to continue. It wasn't fixed until Wednesday and there is still dripping.   \n\n6.) The \""renovation.\"" We looked at the \""renovated\"" apartments because they offered to move us into one. Basically, it's a stainless steel version of the cheapest appliances possible and a flimsy, paper sticker that looks like wood plastered over the already-existing cabinetry. There is a new \""granite\"" counter top and breakfast bar, but the cabinet facings, not the cabinets, are the only thing replaced. So the cabinets are still cheap press board and very shallow. And forget about being able to put so much as a spatula inside the drawers.   \n\n7.) Maintenance work begins obnoxiously at 6 or 7 a.m. Also, it took over a week to get a new kitchen light and we have been waiting more than two weeks to get a kitchen cabinet fixed, despite putting in a request several weeks ago.\n\nFinally, know that if you move here you will be a cog in a machine and not a person. My husband and I never missed the rent once for three years. When my husband got a new job, the pay schedule meant we would be five days late. We called them ahead of time to let them know, bringing a leave and earnings statement showing when his first paycheck would get deposited. Did they care? Nope. Just had us served, beginning the eviction process, and tacked on $80 of fees.  \n\nI understand they have a corporate process in place, but if your renter is telling you ahead of time they'll miss the rent and hasn't had a problem for three years, maybe some flexibility and customer satisfaction should take precedence. So much for acting in good faith. <|endoftext|>

The exhibits were fairly interesting & informative and the building was very attractive, with some nice sculptures in front and in the courtyard area.

Today I went in to open a small business account and was serviced by Phillip who has worked for BofA for over 10 years. He was very knowledgeable about the products which helped me and my business partner make the best decisions. His level of professionalism was top 10. I now know more about the services BofA has to offer and a new friend. Thank you BofA for hiring such wonderful people to represent your organization. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The filet here is awesome at only $22 (with fries, a salad, and biscuits and bread). Additionally, there is great Texas stuff all over the walls, with a definite focus on the Big Bend (Marfa, Terlingua, etc.) and Gulf Coast regions. Good weeknight specials, but I have not tried weekend brunch yet. I've been here about 3 times. It's a real chicken fried steak kind of place, so don't bring a woman here unless she's into that kind of thing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was looking for a Chinese food cater for a small group party. Lotus catered a couple of friends' wedding so I called them to give it a try, though I had not been there before. Linda was super nice and she definitely knows how to do catering business and make her customers happy. I ordered fan fried dumplings and chicken wings. They were delicious. My guests were happy with the food too. Linda not only asked if I needed extra paper products and dipping sauces also followed up and asked how the food was. Linda was also very flexible with order amount and offered great prices for my orders. Great experience, also cater! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i was excited about trying Carolina's as the reviews were great but I have to say I was really disappointed.  First, it is not a restaurant per se but a fast food place where one orders from the counter.  Oh well, that is OK if the food is good but the menu was much like a Taco Bell with very little variation (tacos, burritos, chimichangas, etc.).  I ordered the beef enchiladas but to begin with I was really put off by all the styrofoam, everything was on styrofoam, the drinks, and the meal even if you were eating inside and then plastic forks.  No chips and salsa to start with just styrofoam!!  Then I had to take it back as they gave me chicken enchiladas even though it was marked correctly.  With that, I was looking forward to the meal but it was just 'blah', it was OK, nothing was wrong with it just not very flavorful (maybe it was the styrofoam! JK).  On the pro side, they were busy but got the order out quickly and they were nice enough.  However, if you are looking for a 'restaurant', this is not it, and you can pick up something on your lunch hour quickly and take it wherever but certainly not a dining experience so go with that in mind but there are too many good flavorful Mexican restaurants to go to than to hit Carolina's except for quickness and grab and go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  ever been to dick's last resort? you know, the restaurant we're the servers are intentionally angry and mean because its funny (kinda) and its the theme? well, this should be majerles theme cuz the service is horrid, horrid, horrid. ive never had even mediocre service there. in fact, most of their \""servers\"" seem to lack a pulse...something that should be manditory for the position. how these people survive on tips is beyond me...americans are just generous people i guess. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This school is a terrible deal for what you pay.  I got my math degree here, and I feel my educations was average at best, so why did I pay twice as much? They don't have rigorous science programs here, and even their beloved pharmacy school seems to be self-serving to artificially inflate graduation rates.\n\n The money does not go to the professors -- many of them are part-time adjuncts who do not earn much, so despite small classrooms, they are burnt out and don't have time to devote to their lesson plans.  I do not support this unethical business practice.  \n\nThe campus itself is garbage, there were cockroaches all through the dorms and food quarters when I was there 2006-2010, the dorms are old and falling apart, there is no campus life to speak of.  \n\nIn general there is just really no reason to come here and pay twice as much money for this garbage school.  I left this school 60k in debt and could have gotten the same or better education elsewhere - I DO NOT recommend this school. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> On a whim while missing home, I did a Yelp search for Texas Kolaches and Rainbow Donuts is what I got.  It's not close to my house, being in Phoenix, but luckily, it is close to my new job.  I don't make it up here nearly often enough, but when I do, it's always worth it!  \nNot only are they the only place in Phoenix with Texas Kolaches (that sign isn't lying...I can't find them anywhere else), they also have a huge selection of donuts!  \nMy personal favorites are the spicy sausage kolache and chocolate frosted buttermilk donuts.  I've tried the bacon maple donut, and it was good, but it really needed more bacon (is there such a thing as ever enough bacon?).  Other winners are of course, the sprinkle donut, the cake donuts, and some kind of chocolate cake donut with a honey glaze.  Really, I don't think I've ever had a bad donut here.  \nThe woman behind the counter is always friendly and patient with me as I take forever deciding what I want (I always go in for 1 or 2 and come out with 6 or 7).  \nThere are a few Rainbow Donuts sprinkled around town, but they're all independently owned.  I've never tried the others, so just to be safe, you better just come to this one.  :) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok, the service can ruin the meal and experience! \n\nThat being said my coworker and I stopped into Applebee's for the Pick n' Pair lunch special. The hostess sat us at our table with no greeting and lucky for us she was our waitress as well...sarcasm intended and required. \n\nShe took our drink order walked away several minutes later she returned with our drinks...asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we placed our ordered. I chose the Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup. \n\nNow, I don't know how long it takes to put soup in the bowl and throw some salad on a plate but with maybe two other tables occupied and it being late in the afternoon it certainly doesn't take half my lunch hour. And for those of us who try to leave the office for some peace of mind and freedom during the workday...when you are on your lunch hour every moment counts.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived with the few moments we had left on a lunch break. I scarfed it down I think it tasted ok. From what I remember, the salad was spicy and the jalapeno dressing was yummy! The chicken tortilla soup was just ok. It could have used a few more pieces of chicken and spice to take it up a notch. \n\nOverall, the experience was horrible. The service was horrible. The food was ok. I won't be running back to this location any time soon. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good.  I got the barbecue burger with mild sauce.  Would probably go for hot sauce next time since mild was not spicy at all.  The toppings are nothing special, but the meat itself was cooked well and, for lack of a better term, meaty.  I was hungry and this really hit the spot.  I don't normally go for potato salad, but ordered it based off another review.  It was great!  I even could've eaten a little more than was on the plate.  I also liked the decor/environment -- very homey. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not the best I have had mediocre and generic for that matter. I ordered the carnitas(fried porks pieces) and what I got was like five chunks of dry flavorless pork. Not good kinda left feeling sick. The rest of the food ordered by the rest of my party was none to appetizing either. I recommend going to find a place on or by south blvd in Charlotte  like Azteca it's well worth the extra five minute drive. The only plus to this place was the super sized sodas. Haha <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start by saying, I have not had a problem with the staff. I have seen Dr. Deem and really liked him. He is very down to earth, understanding, knowledgeable, and comforting. I would highly recommend him as a primary care provider. I have also seen a few nurse practioners here in other departments that I have liked. Unfortunately, my biggest problem is with billing. What I have learned by working in the health field is that most people do not understand billing and health insurance and therefore often times get overcharged. I have only been to Christie Clinic a few times, but I seem to have a billing issue every time I go.  My first appointment I had was a preventative annual physical which should be billed as such in order to have the appointment paid at 100%. There also should not be a co-pay for preventative physicals according to my insurance. However, instead of billing it as an annual physical, Christie Clinic seems to only bill as medical office visits. There is a big difference between the two especially when it comes to payment. I have tried to call to resolve this problem, and all they told me is  \""you probably said something during the visit that made it an office visit instead of a physical.\"" Something I said? Really? Even the labs that the doctor ordered for me were labeled as \""preventative screening.\"" Even when the doctor entered the room, he said \""You're here for an annual physical right?\"" Yet, apparently I \""must have\"" said the wrong thing during that visit. \n\nThe other separate issue I had is I went in for an annual pap smear last year. Which was also supposed to be paid 100% because it is preventative screening. Well first of all, the doctor billed the reading of the specimen on a separate day from the actual visit. Therefore, (according to my insurance) it looked as if I made two visits in the same week and therefore my insurance only paid for the first date that they used for billing. If they were billed on the same day like they should have been, I would not have had a bill. \n\nOn another visit, I had some lab work that came back abnormal. I did not get a phone call, a letter, or any type of response from the clinic, letting me know of my abnormal results. I did not call them myself because they told me that I would not hear back from them unless there was a problem. Therefore, I thought everything was fine. Not only did I not know of a problem in the first place, but they decided to do further testing without even notifying me first. They did further testing on the specimen without my consent. The only way I found out about this further testing and initial abnormal result is from the bill I received 9 months later. Yes, 9 months later. When trying to discuss the bill, they told me that the bill was final and there was nothing that they could do.\n\nNot to mention, if you ever ask for paperwork with the diagnosis codes on them, a good majority of the time Christie Clinic uses diagnosis codes for what they are trying to rule out. For example, when trying to rule out multiple sclerosis, they actually DIAGNOSE you with multiple sclerosis even when it has not been confirmed by testing. That's a pretty serious diagnosis if you ask me. I have seen it done with other things too such as myasthenia gravis, pneumonia, seizures, etc. Good thing insurances are not allowed to deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions anymore... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation. The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming. The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.\n\nOur second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.\n\nIf you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you can ignore the interior (which smells like tobacco pipe smoke and is a little run down), the restaurant owner's crazy friends, crazy Ethiopian tv shows, and the location, you'll be in for a treat. Very authentic and balanced Eritrean/Ethiopian food.\n\nMostly meat dishes on the menu with a three vegetarian options. The proportions are HUGE and they give you more than enough injera to finish your dish (and someone else's!).\n\nFriendly, hole in the wall place. I'll definitely return (for take out only). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good food. Very good prices. And the staff are very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family and I are regulars at Wally's because at Wally's, regulars are family.\n\nBeyond the deep, deep personal connection I have with the restaurant I can tell you that the food is unquestionably great and the service is always top-notch. (There are a few servers and bartenders who have been there since the place opened 10 years ago.) \n\nMy favorite menu items are as follows: 1) Cuban Panini 2) Frisco Burger 3) Meatloaf 4) Pot Roast 5) Spaghetti. The fact that Wally's can do all five of those things extremely well should tell you all you need to know.\n\nThere is something old school cool about a joint where the Proprietor is almost always present and Wally's is that place. He's the guy with the grey hair and beard who probably handed you your menu. Tell him I said hello and that the Price family loves him like their own. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.\n\nMy dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since, fried pickles don't exist in CA, I loved eating them while I was out in Charlotte.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would eat at this place again.   ;o) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointing deli. The place just seemed dirty. Has the menu been replaced in a decade? No Kreplach. The chicken broth in the matzoh ball soup was of poor flavor and dilute. My daughter wouldn't even eat it.\n\nThe tuna and egg salads were pretty good but we did not get the sides that were advertised with the dishes and the tomato in which the tuna was stuffed was hard and flavor-less. The waitress must have made 20 trips to get us everything in our order and we didn't request any substitutions.\n\nThis is not a kosher-style deli either. Plenty of bacon and ham on the menu.\n\nI would have given this a 1-star but other ratings indicated that some of the meatier items were satisfactory and I did not get a chance to try those. Unfortunately, I won't since I'm unlikely to return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Since I'm from\nChicago we have the best pizza, my boyfriend swears by their chicken BBQ pizza, well done., it was really amazing! Their salad list is the most unique salad array I have ever seen at a pizza place, we got the Pablo Picasso and some kind of loaded Ceaser! Yum! Drinks are huge. Service is good for a pizza place, the half baked cookie with icecream is a must! This is the first oreganos in az, and we went back on our way home to Chicago. My boyfriend wanted to bring one back for his friends but we couldn't figure out how to bring it back <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh. Dirty. Long lines. Walked out without making purchase . <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Oh my god, oh my god. Where have you been for my entire pizza eating life?  Spinatos is great!  I love the spicy Italian pizza and the ... Mamas spinach is what I think the pizza is called. I have not dined in, but I will be making up for that soon... I promise. The quality of the food and the friendly family feeling service is great. Although not an artisan pizza place like the Parlor or Bianco, this is my go to place for pizza.  Who needs Pizza Hut or any other delivery chain when you have a great pizza place right around the corner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me first say how delicious the cornbread was!\n\nThe catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.\n\nSeems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.\n\nI can at least say that I tried this place :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm disappointed nearly every time I go here. Store is just too small. Variety sucks, prices suck. Why does it have to be so close?? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For downtown phx, this place was once pretty cool.  But the 'bigger' it got, the portions got smaller, the food got worse and the service got snottier and it's pretty much a skip now.\nI do love a few of the menu items.  But I think its mostly due to the large amount of MSG used in the them and the excellent tofu preparation.  The sauces are one step from the grocery store otherwise, and hugely overpriced for what they are.\nThe concept of making people wait even when the restaurant is empty is ridiculous.  It doesn't make you look cool, Fate, it makes you look like you don't give a shit about your customers.  Also, the hiring practice there seems to be 'no serving experience, vapid, hipster, 'hot' girl?'  PERFECT!  and thus, the service often blows.  (save for a few servers that have been there forever, and are awesome)\n\nI used to love this place when the food was better and it was less pretentious years ago.  Now its just overrated and overhyped.  A true sign of how a lack of competition allows even the worst to survive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is where everyone knows your name. The food is fantastic and the servers have all been working there for years. I've been coming here for 30+ years and go at least once a week. \n\nWhat you need to know:\nService: is it the fastest? No, but if you get to know the servers and owner they become family. They are all so nice and friendly.\n\nSalsa: sure there main salsa might look like tomato paste but it is so good and made fresh. If you want chunky salsa the just ask for it, but beware sometimes it is really spicy. \n\nThis is a family owned business so support them and other locally owned businesses. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hot diggity dang this place is just of the hook tasty.  The big unit is this huge amazing hot dog, with chili, relish, tomato, jalapenos, and cheese.  Also tried the brownie dessert and oh mylanta....it was orgasmically delicious! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They have all their roses in now. We got the Cecille Brunner Climbing Rose bush and the Jean La Joie. They look healthy and are already starting to leaf out. Can't wait to see the show of roses in a year. They have a huge selection available right now but are selling out like crazy. So go fast if you want roses for your garden. Ideal time to get them in the ground is now. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really enjoy birthday cakes and I have to say that Fry's can make a good cake. In fact, when put in front of me next to a similar cake from AJ's, I cannot tell a difference (since I am not a spring chicken anymore, I have had many cakes from both places, although I do love AJ's).  \n\nMy mother recently purchased two cakes from Fry's: a black forest cake and a Napoleon cake in honor of my birthday.  During the birthday song, I plucked off some blackberries from one of the cakes (hush, it was my birthday!). When the lights came on, I was a bit horrified to see that the remaining berries were covered in white fuzz.  I am very very certain that this fuzz was not sugar, but MOLD.\n\nIf you are going to sell a cake topped with fruit, it is very important to use FRESH fruit, or just abandon the concept and put chocolate on the cake instead. I mean, it is a cake, not a tart, and everyone likes chocolate. Or, how about a fruit-shaped cookie or fondant molded into the shape of a strawberry?   \n\nNeedless to say, I survived eating the moldy berries, and apparently the taste was well-masked by super sweet frosting. But Fry's Bakery, please take note of this because putting moldy fruit on your otherwise pretty cake is sinful, disgusting, sad and offensive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible staff! Terrible attitude and we could tell didn't want to be there.  Screwed up our bill and was visible aggravated and angry when we questioned charges.  This awful service makes us never want to return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In response to the people asking why anyone would rate this place less than 5 stars... we don't all have the same taste, thats why.\n\nI like Pane Bianco quite a bit, but I have to admit that I have only had one sandwich of the menu, and that is the Soppresata. The first few times I had it, it was covered in roasted red peppers, and oh so delicious. One day they started using carmelized onions, killed the sandwich, and that is why I stopped going. I like the concept, and I like the deal they have worked out with Lux next door which allows you to eat there as long as you buy something from them. They don't have to do that, so it's nice they do. I have always liked Chris, and praised his use of high quality ingredients, and his sandwich shop is no exception. Only thing I don't like is sitting on the side of Central Avenue listening to cars whistle by. I always wish they would move the patio dining to the other parking lot on the south side of the restaurant, and then use the current patio for more parking. At least this way you wouldn't have to listen to the cars as much. Don't think they own that lot though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The  petco near me was out of my boys favorite off the rawhide bar so, I called this store and asked if they had a rawhide bar. Yes we do--  Hoped in the car to make the six mile drive\n\nExcuse me?  Where is your rawhide bar?  Oh I'm sorry we font have that anymore.  There are a few on the endcap over there.\n\nReally?  Excuse me, do you have a water bowl where my dog can get a drink?  Yes, in the back of the store by the restrooms.  Uh, theres no bowl back there.  Well, maybe thats because the water fountain is broke.  I will tell the mgr tomorrow. How does that help me now?\n\nHow much  did those rawhides weigh?  .93lbs.  Over on the other scale, it was less than .75.  Let me weigh it again--oops now its .95. Really?\n\nHere's a review you can do over the phone to get a 2 dollar discount.\n\nI REALLY DON'T think you want me to do a review and I wont be coming back anyway\n\nOk, have a great day, sir <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Took my in-laws, step-daughter and husband. Was really irked about the prices, felt that we could have done something better for that amount of money. Will one one child in our group we were done in about an hour, but had purchased tickets for the cosmic coasters show at the planetarium. So we went to the Lab Cafe and spent $10 on a sandwich and soda. I think that we would have had more fun if all the \""cool\"" stuff wasn't extra. If you want to do all this be prepared to spend an extra $40 and that is with out getting anything to eat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I defy anyone to find a civil, knowledgeable human being who works in this place. I'd rather be stuck in Newark Airport than shop here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I go to this place a lot for the buffet which is ok. Not really that big of a buffet and if you don't get there when it is fresh you might get some pretty cold food. However this review is about their take-out service. I give them a C- for this experience. They do not give a good portion size to take home and the food was a little bland. I expected more from them. I ordered the pan fried dumpling and the sauce that came with it was very gross it was like they didn't know how to make the proper sauce so they just gave me soy sauce and some spices to go a long with it. It was not good at all. I will probably be going back but only for the buffet would not recommend take out and i will not be doing that again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just read a good portion of the previous reviews and they seem consistent with my experience. Place was empty on a Thursday night . We ordered the ziti, lasagna and tilapia and the quality of the food was good. Touching on the other reviews I think the issue with spot is how disconnected the staff is and owner trying to do too much. Bartender, waiter, entertainer, etc... I don't think they know what they want to be yet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fellow Yelp reviews and close proximity lead us to choose the restaurant for dinner a few nights back. The service was phenomenal, the food was delicious and the overall experience was incredible. I will definitely be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fast, efficient and honest service. A bit pricey, but the shop nearby would have taken three hours minimum and cost more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.\n\nI'm done shopping at this store. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Harmony hours listed are dead wrong and they are open, not closed. Makes me wonder about the fact-checkers at yelp... do they have any? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate giving bad reviews. Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given. I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible. Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight. Awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The sandwiches are giant, the atmosphere is good. I was there while the Steelers were on, so it was festive.\nI agree they are a little dry...so get hot sauce, or ask for some mayo or ranch, ect...\nAnd it was quite warm in there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went to Capital Grille for resturant week Pre Fix menu. I guess I was expecting more. The atmosphere was plesant and the service was not all that bad (waiter was at our table a little too much, interrupting conversation).\nThe salad was ok. I could have had better elsewhere....lettuce was wilted.\nThe filet was ok. My steak was not cooked very evenly and for a five star steak house I was expecting a perfect steak. It also had very little flavor itself. The port wine reduction helped with the flavor.\nThe side was nice a truffle mac and cheese...but again nothing to write home about.\nDessert was good. Pumkin cheesecake, my husband had the apple crisp.\nWould I go back and pay full price. NO. This is not a place for something new or different and the quality was below par. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the best Japanese steakhouse I've ever been to in a long time. The food is outstanding, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating, and the seating doesn't make you feel like you have to rub elbows with your neighbor. \n\nThe place is divided into 2 sections. The hibachi grills and the sushi bar. You have a choice of sitting in chairs at the hibachi grills or going into 1 of their rooms where you have to take your shoes off and sit down on the floor (they provide pillows). I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.\n\nYou make your selections off the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect (whether you get sweet or not), and your glass is always full. \n\nThe 1st items to come out are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love their ginger salad. It's not over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.\n\nNext comes the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) and for the sushi, try the one that has \""Pacific or Pacifica\"" in the name (sorry, I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh and tastes wonderful. \n\nThe entertainment begins when the chef comes out to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great for kids. They cut the tails off of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal portions are reasonable and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! Of course, everything is nice and hot when it hits your plate and fresh because it's cooked right there in front of you. On my first trip there, I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't hot from the grill (yes, I've been to some places where I was sweating when the cooking was finished).\n\nIf you have a birthday, this is a great place to go! You get your meal like always and they give you a cake (that is so sweet, your teeth will rot with 1 bite), they sing to you in Japanese, and you get your picture taken and it is framed (a paper frame, but hey it's still cool lookin).\n\nI can keep going on and on about how great this place is. I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not careful, the bill can get a bit high if you keep adding all the goodies they offer. If you want a good comparison, go to Kabuto's and then Nakato's and you'll see a huge difference. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been here alot love the food.Cummin beef and water boiled beef and jalape\u00f1o beef are my favorite the waiters don't know a lot of english my seem rude at time but I'm sure it's a language thing I remember one time I ordered and the waiter was no help had to ask for everything but I didn't mind because the food is worth it and when I was leaving I did not leave a TIP because I feel she didn't deserve it and the lady at the register saw I didn't leave a tip on my receipt and she goes to the table to see if I left a tip haha and she looks at me and says no TIP? Haha I was shocked I looked her right in the eye and said Yes No Tip!!!  haha she got mad and talked to the other Chinese lady in chineses probley talking shit haha but the food is worth it <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If ever a great neighborhood bar existed, this is the place.  The dedication to an atmosphere that stays hip, knows its customers, and evolves to capture your heart and palette remains the core of this perennial hit year after year.  \n\nFrom the great happyhour, to the ribs on sundays, to the new addition of vietnamese cusine there is nothing on the menu that isn't ready to bring a smile to your face.  Every time my friends can't decide where to go, I respond, Moto!  Everyone finds a dish or sushi roll that fits their mood and a brew that compliments the moment.\n\nThat alone gets them 4 stars, the 5th star is reserved for having one of the best desserts in town, the Mojo....ice cream sushi..... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst customer service EVER.  This is a repeat offense with the car audio install bay.  \n\nThe rep Anthony has a really offensive sales tactic of treating customers like idiots.  He must have some kind of super power because he told me (over the phone) that what I had in my car currently sounded \""okay\"" but not as good as it could if I bought some new speakers in addition to the deck I was inquiring about having installed.  \n\nYou know what Anthony, I'll go to Fry's or better yet order from Crutchfield. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So, my fellow yelpers who love happy hours...I have discovered a new happy hour destination! Phoenix City Grill, which sports happy hour from 3pm-close. Yes, til close!!! Sweet baby Jesus, finally someone answered my wishes! \n\nFirst off, the decor was lovely, as was the ambiance. Happy hour is only available in the bar area, where I quickly ventured to. Some of the happy hour items are: Beef sliders with yummy Tillamook cheese (whaddup Oregon!!!), grilled fish tacos, hummus, Green chile cheese dip, beef and chicken skewers, etc. All in all, a great selection with wonderful execution. \n\nThe liquor selection is also solid. Any bar that has items, such as Plum Vodka, gets a thumbs up in my book. The wine selection is also good. \n\nPCG is right off the 51 and also closely located to my dive (yes, my personal dive) the Swizzle. \n\nMy only gripe: The bar area was serviced by one waiter - the bartender. So, being that he was making drinks for the restaurant side as well as serving the bar area, the service suffered. He was not nice, inattentive, and at times rude. \n\nI was able to ignore him as the food made its way to my belly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There may be equals but not better restaurants than the Wild Thaiger. (Have no idea what a Thaiger is...is there a tame one?)  Anyway, went there today for lunch for thefirst time and was super impressed.  Service by a drop dead georgeous Thai waitress was excellent.  Food was superb...don't see how it could have been better.  Wife had chicke curry which was excellent.  I had pad tai which could not have been better.  Food came immediately.  Steaming hot.  Lovely!!\nHardest part of visit was finding the parking lot.  Once you know where it is, you'll always know.  I parked on right side of the building.  Fortunately there's a sign saying it's on othe other side.  From then on.....a piece of cake.\nI'm no stranger to Thai food and Wild Thaiger is one of the best. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have never posted a negative review before but felt the need to do so this time.  I always hesitate to go into Lonnie's because their staff is not the friendliest but I knew they had an item that I wanted so I bit the bullet and went in.  Unfortunately, I had my two kids with me.  I strongly dislike unruly kids in shops (or anywhere else) so I demand that my boys be respectful and not touch anything in places like Lonnie's.  \n\nI was looking at something in the case and my children were meandering around the shop - which is very small so they were never more than 20 feet from me.  The woman in the back room starts calling to them in her fake-nice voice, \""Kids, go stand with your mom!  There are dangerous chemicals out there.\""  Ohhhkay - I see her point but her tone was pretty aggressive.  Once my kids were next to me, she goes back to her post and says to her boss, loudly and clearly, \""I'm allergic to kids.\""  He didn't hear her so she said it again!  She thought she was being funny.\n\nNow, I could sound like some mom who thinks her kids can do no wrong.  I am NOT that kind of parent.  My kids were being quiet and unobtrusive.  She was just rude.\n\nI've also witnessed her being downright mean to her coworkers.  I guess I won't have to see that anymore because, even though Lonnie's is fairly close to my house, I won't be back.\n\nTrust me on this one - go to SJ Jewelry Supply.  Mario will be courteous and helpful, unlike these people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped in and was greeted by hostess who was polite and friendly. Service from waiter, Gavin, who explained the food and recommended plates. Very professional and friendly. Ordered calamari as appetizer and it was delicious. Ordered the salmon and it was good. The Tiramasu I ordered for dessert was ok.  The place is small and there is an outdoor eating area . Place was busy but wasn't very noisy, which is good. This place does stay open late, like past 2am. I did like the atmosphere and would go back again. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Waited 45 minutes to get in at 8pm on Friday, that wasn't the bad part though..\nWaited 30 minutes for our drinks (our waitress didn't even show up, the host had to bring them) and after that, 2 hours for our food. By time it got to us we were so sick of waiting and so tired since it was 11pm that we could barely eat. \n\n\nThe food wasn't particularly good, I ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans. Chicken was dry, green beans under seasoned and bland. The macaroni was good, they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay. They got two orders wrong in our party of 4 though.\n\nThe waitress apologized profusely and we received a discount for our wait but I will not return to this place again. \n\n\nTL;DR\n\nOver three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We got a groupon and was not impressed. Overall rating 5 out of 10.  Food was ok. Waitress was bothered by us.  It was hot in there.  I did like their pasta alfredo Primavera.   The other thing I didn't like is they only have one bathroom for everyone. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place. Not fancy, just a great place to hang out with friends. TVs everywhere so it's perfect for game day. There are a couple of pool tables, dart boards, and video games. It reminds me of a place my father goes to back home. The staff are great and they make you feel like a regular. Great people and good times. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I use Volvo Am I for my 2007 XC 70 and I am very happy with their service and prices.  \n\nThe shop is clean and doesn't make me uncomfortable when I visit (sometimes with my kids in tow)...no nude centerfold pictures hanging in the work bays, or leering grease covered weirdos wielding wrenches and blasting death metal on their radio.  And they always get my car in quickly, tell me what it's going to cost me BEFORE starting the work, the prices are always fair and the work is well done.   \n\nAnother big plus for me is that I never feel like I'm being lied to.  Some unethical mechanics think they can take advantage of a woman because it's automatically assumed that we're all ignorant about cars, and some of us are, but I'm not.  I like that they've never told me something outrageous like my turn signal fluid is low, or something that just seemed like they thought I didn't know any better.  I appreciate that I can expect that if they say I need it, I really do need it.  \n\nAnyway, I wouldn't hesitate to take your Volvo here, it's a nice shop and they really know their way around a Volvo. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I understand the hassles.\n\nIts annoying when all you want is a $10 car wash and every time they want to charge you for any number of sealants and crap.  And \""no thank you\"" isn't good enough.  They have to give you their situational anecdotes and keep hassling.  Go to Danny's, they understand that no means no. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm pretty sure this is now called Let-it-Roll Bowl.  I've been here twice in the last few months and it is a really fun place to have a party. The bowling is cheap as dirt, the drinks are cheap as dirt, and the restaurants food is VERY good. \n\nI was here just last Friday night for a girlfriend's birthday and we had a blast.  It was during cosmic bowling and I think EVERYONE had a great time.  Cedric Ceballos was the DJ (yep, you read that right). He was OK. I've heard better, but for sort of a \""low rent\"" part of town, it was wonderful. And very inexpensive.  I will keep visiting as long as they keep their prices right and the atmosphere light. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Other than the convenient location to the Diamondbacks stadium I was not impressed. It's continental breakfast consisted of two types of cereal, bagels and coffee with juices. They put me on the backside in the corner closest room to all the construction. Parking was very limited due to the construction. The window in my room looked into the backyard of someone's home. The AC only covered one part of the room and isn't strong enough to cover outside the bathroom and inside of it. Seeing as it's Arizona it was 110 degrees and the AC is highly needed.\n\nThe customer service was good. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Today was my second time at a Pamela's. During my first trip I made the mistake of 1)not ordering hot cakes 2) dining alone 3)not ordering hotcakes! \n\nI was worried about a wait for a Sunday morning but it was surprisingly only 15minutes. We were seated & greeted promptly. Both of us ordered the morning after breakfast with the strawberry pancakes. The potatoes /home fries were awesome & as another reviewer mentioned it feels as if every bite is different (&fabulous). \n\nSpeaking of fabulous, I'm thankful to have finally experienced the Pamelas hotcake. It was filled with fresh strawberries, sour cream, brown sugar bits.. & every bite was better than the last. Don't let that trio scare or fool you-.it's delicious \n\nNext weekend can't come fast enough to stop back\n\n...forgot to mention it took no time at all for 4 giant plates of food to reach our table. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was the most pleasant dining experience I had on my business trip to Charlotte, and of course it occurred the afternoon I was leaving. After spending a week in suburbia hell, I wanted to see if Charlotte actually had a downtown, and happily I found it, along with affordable parking. We were super hungry, so we literally stepped into the first place that served food once we got out of the car. Luckily it was Ri Ra. I hear this is a rocking place on the weekend, but on a cold Tuesday afternoon, we pretty much had the place to ourselves (except for the loudmouth \""screenwriter\"" at the bar). We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed Harp on tap and sandwiches. My pastrami was delicious, but if I could do it again I would have the full serving of the magnificent mac n' cheese. The lunch menu was extensive with very reasonable prices. The best thing about this place however was our waiter, who is getting married in Jackson Square down here in NOLA this August, bless his heart. He was super nice and attentive with zero fakiness. Best of luck to you, kind sir! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I celebrated a friends birthday today at Postino.  It is a really busy place!  We decided that we would order a little of this and a little of that.  So we started with the NYC Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  I like it, it came with three dipping options, pesto, ketchup, and some sort of mustard.  We had several different bruschetta: tomato jam, arugula and bacon, apple and brie and mozzarella and basil.  All really good.  Italian food is not really my thing, but this was pretty good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please business owner, stay away from Muzak , I had a really bad e experience with this company, first is very expensive , second when u have a problem you have to wait 40 minutes or more for somebody respond , after you wait so long their customer services is horrible , they cant help you,  and they told you somebody going to call u back because we don't know how to help you, after that no body call you back after they told you.  I called another company and I find the same service for 56.00 a month and I was paying to Muzak 250.00 a month the is a big difference , after that a traying to cancel my contract with muzak, And the was very rude with me, And after that they send me a email, that said they i have to pay them 6900.00 for the next 38 month , they loose their mind , they want me to pay for nothing , they service is horrible and rude people, and very expensive they only reason they a stay with them because the prior owner have a contract with the but I can keep paying so much for a poor service and very expensive month fee , I have to send my case to my lawyer ..\nPlease , please stay away from Muzak you can find a better company and service for a LESS  money.  One start because I don't have choice, I would give them cero start if a could.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In case you don't know, Louisianne's has started serving lunch, The good news is that it is inexpensive and delicious. I had a cup of shrimp bisque that was outstanding, and the grilled chicken po'boy tasted very fresh (the shredded romaine lettuce was much appreciated). The only bad news is the general ambience of the upstairs lunch area . . . rather dark and uninviting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I had originally started coming here because I bought a groupon and was looking for a new stylist.\n\nMy total experience here includes 3 haircuts, eye brow wax, and a full head of highlights. The highlights were the icing on the cake and definitely are what made me not want to go back for good.\n\nMy stylist was a very personable woman, but in the end she wasn't very good on listening to what I wanted. 3 seperate times I did not get what I asked for.\n\nThe absolute worst part about this place though is that every single time I've been here I've been rushed in and out and felt very unappreciated. Whoever is running the books and appointments there really needs to get their act together. If you can't handle high traffic then do not OVER BOOK yourselves. I've schedueled all of my appointments well in advance, so it's not like they were squeezing me in.\n\nAtmosphere is also stuffy and unwelcoming. \n\nI decided to give it 2 stars since my stylist was a very nice lady. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Looking for Cajun? Look no further. My favorites are the etufee and gumbo. I stopped in on a Friday night and had the pork chop special, it had to be the biggest and most tender chop I've had! For those of you looking for a classic dirty rice they took me back to a LA coonass swap party. The live guitar sole was a great addition for back ground music. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't stand Castle Boutique.\n\nJust rename it \""TRASH\"" and it would fit it just right.\n\nThis type of place totally makes experimenting with sex look extremely bad and I can't stand that.\n\nI should NEVER walk into a \""fantasy toy\"" store and feel like a pervert. NEVER.\n\nAnd every time I have walked into this one (which is like twice), I have and ended up not buying a thing because you feel so weird.  The bright flourescent lights, the absolute lack of decor... it's just this huge warehouse of sex toys and books.  I can't stand going into grocery stores without decor, much less a place to get a toy to be turned on by.\n\nI don't know if this specific location is like that... I've been to the one on I-17 and Deer Valley... yeah, the one with all the controversy.  It's TERRIBLE. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just not all that impressive from our POV..... ambiance was cozy, comfortable and welcoming but service and food ... meh .  The prime rib was good... halibut was not that fresh tasting (disappointing since the \""knowledgeable\"" server suggested it). The green chili potato .... hmmm.  Well, if you think an uncooked, crunchy pepper the size of a jalapeno filled with a couple of tablespoons of paprika laden mashed potatoes is divine ... then you would be in the right place .  Me? Not so much.\n\nThe salad was fine - but then again, you really have to suck to screw up a salad.  The kicker was when I ordered a glass of Chardonnay... then the server returned with a Pinot Noir ....  \n\nWe took a couple from out of town who were here on their anniversary.  I told the host when I called to check on the reservation (I made it thru Open Table) and then told the host again when we arrived.  They did absolutely nothing with this information but yet I saw some other table get the special acknowledgement.  What a disappointment, all around.  \n\nWould I go back?  Dunno.... There are many other places here in the valley that we need to experience prior to ever giving these folks our hard-earned casheroo.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Recently moved to Phoenix, and this place is in my neighborhood.  El Pollo Loco is overpriced food with very small proportions.  I spent like $10 on some quesadilla's and they came with a small packet of tortillas and mushy salsa.  I'm a skinny guy, but was still hungry after eating this. The staff at this location seemed uninterested in their jobs both times I tried out them out.  Not worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Let's say you're going to an important event such as a black-tie affair. \nThis is your big chance to impress the boss, showing him how you really are executive material... deserving of that Senior VP spot he's been holding open since Smithers moved back to Ohio. \n\nBut you're not going to do this alone. You need your wife with you and she's a far cry from the executive wife's look after having that fifth child a few months back.\n\nWhat do you do?\nSimple.\nSIgn her up for a day of pampering at the Red Door Spa where they'll turn your lactating little housefrau into Cinderella and in only a day! Go figure. \n\nI recommend the Signature Escape package. You're probably going to want to toss in a massage, body tan, facial and make-up too.\nIt's going to cost you a bundle, but it beats the alternative when she shows up with her long unkempt toenails, trying to pull it off as a French pedicure. \n\nOr her generous application of  sky-blue eye makeup, making her look like a rodeo clown. \n\nAnd that gown... two sizes two small..squeezing her tits into oblivion so that by the time dessert is served, she's managed a one-woman parody of the BP spill.  \n\nJust do it man.\nShell out the five hundred or so bucks to make her feel like a woman again, and not the sweat-wearing, baby-vomit smelling inmate she's become. \n\nNot only will she thank you, your boss just may sign you up for that corner office after he sees your little hottie...secretly hoping to get a piece of that someday after he fires you. \n\nSeriously?\nDo this for her at least once in your married life together even if she's become a size sixteen after number five.\nJust think of it as dating a Lane Bryant model for the evening. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For the price and area this place was a huge disappointment. \n\n1.  We ordered a king size bed with our suite - got 2 doubles. My wife and I had to sleep separately. \n2.  The bathroom ceiling was all pealed\n3.  Would take until late afternoon until our room would be made up - one day was 5pm. \n4. Pool was filthy - needed to be vacuumed. Also missing tile all around the pool and on the decking. \n5. We were part of a wedding party and it wasn't booked that way - so we lost the rate, and were charged for parking.  I was willing to eat the rate but they wouldn't budge on the parking.\n\nOn the bright side: The staff is very friendly - Edith the breakfast cook makes a breakfast to die for and the rest of the help is also kind.  \n\nSimply put: This place needs some TLC and more caring management.\n\nOne more thing, during the trip my son woke up with a big red welt on his leg. Thought it was a mosquito bite, but after looking at the reviews and a picture, no question a bed bug. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I moved from L.A. to Phoenix a few years ago and missed the little cool small shop restaurant places with character.  Le Grande Orange made me feel at home, and now that I'm back in L.A. I'm super psyched to find out there seems to be a new one opening in Pasadena.  Does anyone know if this is the same owners?  Looks like it.  I HOPE SO!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  People at front desk are not friendly, borderline rude. Its a \""historic hotel\"" but mostly just no attention to detail as far as cleanliness and finesse. Rope-esk shower head mount (not the piping) is at a whooping 5'5 (could be relocated with no plumbing cost). Exhaust fan in restroom has no removalable top and had about 3\"" of dust. \n\nGave 2 stars because the pool deck (level 3) and Thai restaurant downstairs are great, otherwise would be a 1 star. For $189/night x 10 nights I was disappointed, if Palomar would have been available this would have never even occurred, needed something within walking distance of work for the week (2 blocks away). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If it were possible to give a restaurant a negative rating, this establishment would receive it.  My family and I have frequented Kabuto for years, but it has deteriorated so significantly we will never return.  The restaurant is run down, and not cleaned thoroughly.  On our trip tonight my four year old asked why it smelled bad when walking in the door.  The quality of the food has substantially gone down while the prices have increased.  The vegetables on the hibachi were not done at all, while the steak I ordered had a rancid taste.  When I complained the \""owner\"" started raising her voice at me in front of my young daughter and three other family members screaming that she would not allow me to say the steak I had been served was spoiled.  There is a reason this restaurant is having to run specials on a large plastic sign out front, and why the last time we visited there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.  It is very sad to watch a once good local establishment run into the ground. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The \""help\"" I received at this Apple store was laughable. I arrived for an intro class with a fully functional machine, took the \""class\"" which was pretty lame (most of what you learn can be done at home with simple exploration) and then wanted to get some quesstions answered about getting old e-mail from my previous machine. Our instructor told us to snag a guy on the floor to answer our questions (three of them). The advanced class is no longer offered, so much of what we had hoped to learn about using i-cloud and transmission from other devices, we will have to figure out on our own. We found a guy, but he was hostile and rude. He eventually walked away from us after giving us the incorrect information about e-mail retrieval and password resetting, leaving us with a machine that no longer functioned properly. We sought out the guy with the clipboard and he said there were no appointments available at the genius bar for 4 hours and that was at another store across town. We had traveled 50 minutes to get to this store from our home. We pointed out to him that is was HIS employee who screwed up the device. They REALLY didn't care about serving their customers. When a young woman arrived without an appointment, the clip board guy told her to wait a minute and they would see what they could do to help!! My husband and I are in our 60's and use computers and smart phones every day, but there seems to be an arrogance in this store if you are not the young, hip, techie person. My husband spent an hour or so on the phone with Apple tech support and got things straightened out. THEY were very helpful. This store does not have the \""Nordstrom\"" customer service ethic and  is not a place to go for help. Their focus is to demo, sell their devices and act like customer service is beneath them. Their \""coolness\"" is a turn-off and they act like they are doing you a great favor if they answer a question. It seems to us that Apple is selling more devices than they have the manpower to support in their stores. I will avoid these stores like the plague. All of this makes me wonder why I bought an Apple product in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped by for my first visit.  Ordered the club sandwich and DELICIOUS !  Bread was soft and a little chewy, right balance of meat and veggies.  Very fresh and the condiments were perfect.   Not your typical sandwich shop.   Will repeat....! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I brought my car & was conned into getting the \""express detail\"" for 29.99(on sale from 39.99)..they didn't explain that didn't include the wSh so when I went to pay it was $53...ok fine....sign says it takes 15 minutes... 45 minutes later I knew something was up & went to see... Upon seeing me coming they told me it was finished... I noticed a film on front 1/4panel & door....I asked them to wipe down but it wouldn't come off.. Manager comes out says it must have been on there when I brought it in...I told him the car is a month old & the film  wasn't there when I came in...  Then a detailer comes over & tries some wax on it & it seemed to do the trick but they told me I would have to pay extra AND make an appointment for the wax job as they didn't cause the film... Bottom line is the manager is a meathead & this place blows.\n\nUpdate.... Now I notice there are 20-30 nats or maybe fleas on the inside of windshield... This place is terrible... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was pretty disappointed in my experience at DV. I made an appointment for 3 pedicures for 11:15, it was 11:45 before we were all in a chair. Strike one. They started on my friends before coming to me again throwing off the point of making an appointment for 3. Strike two. I opted for the $5 callus remover and she did an extremely poor job my feet are still rough and I can feel all the spots she missed. None of the techs were in the least bit friendly or personable. \n\nThere are so many nail joints in the area I won't be returning to this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is for the Maternity/Labor and Delivery/Post Partum Care. We would not come back here or encourage people to come here. There are hospitals that provide better service in our opinion. \n\nPros\n1 Nice Labor and Delivery Room. \n2. Nice Attentive nurses in Labor and Delivery\n3. Registration/Checking in is simple\n4. Parking is convenient\n\nCons\n(1) Post-Partum Rooms are old, small and run down. The bed was not comfortable. \n\n(2) During my stay, the post partum nurses were friendly but spent must time chatting/gossiping instead of being attentive to patients IMHO. \n\n(3) Resident Physicians were not a positive experience. We didn't feel comfortable in their care. Would have preferred not to have dealt with residents.  A Resident also delayed our discharge by hours by not dropping off a written prescription\n\n(4) Billing Office was difficult. They tried to make us pay for our newborn's charges which were different from the mother's charges. Newborn babies are not yet on insurance plans. And since they are not yet on your insurance, the charges are very high as you could imagine. We were not required to pay them before leaving the hospital but they certainly pressured us into paying. We went home and put our baby on our insurance plan which reduced the charges by 2/3. \n\n(5) Discharge was significantly delayed.  An ultrasound and hearing screen was ordered the previous day in the morning. They didn't do the ultrasound and hearing screen until the following day in the afternoon. These are routine tests that are usually done a few hours after they are ordered. Instead of going home that morning, we didn't leave until 4 PM. What contributed to the delay was a Resident failing to leave a prescription that our doctor ordered. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had two waitresses for our table of 8, each only did a section of the table but service was very bad. From our three drinks ordered, we only got two. It was pricey. We won't be coming back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i just finished a two year lease at the Heritage. honestly the only reason we stayed so long is that we were on the 3rd floor!!!! moving was a b---ch. the kitchen photo is the same as our units exactly. the dishwasher sucks big time! the pigeons overtake your balcony too.\n\nthis place is not built very well, they are constantly having blackouts and they do not compensate for lost food or anything (however one time they did put us up at a hotel). there is no bike rack and you cannot leave your bikes chained anywhere outside your apartment. the security gates are always stuck open, so anyone can come in. several of the residents are continual beggars and bummers of cigarettes and coins who loiter around the mail boxes.\n\nhowever i loved the pool area; as hardly anyone ever used it while i was there. i did have some great pool parties, but there isn't a restroom by the pool, so it was a constant hike upstairs for the loo. \n\nthe windows are so thin, that you hear each passing wind, bird and rattle from your neighbors doors closing shut. i would not recommend this place unless you can deal with the blackouts, beggars and continual shake of the window. if your an east coaster, this might be the place for you; because you can hear everything your neighbor is doing in their place too! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice, despite its small size.  However, the location had a poor beer selection when we visited and appeared to be out of at least 3 of their draft selections. For well drinks, my girlfriend typically drinks vodka and cranberry and noted that their pour was very weak on vodka. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible food, service always rushed.  I've waited longer at Taco Bell, and had better tacos.  The food is greasy and tasteless.  \nZapata's has a few small positives.  Their outside patio looking over the man-made pond is nice.  Their margaritas are good, chips and salsa decent.  When I'm just meeting a friend for drinks, not a meal, this place is fine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped by this place for a drink and ended up staying for a couple more! Had a blast talking to the bar tender and playing video games while sipping on my PBR. We ordered up some fried mushrooms and another round.\n\nSeems to be a great place to hang out with a group and have a good time.\n\nI'll be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really want to like this place because it is right across the street from where I work and we really have no other lunch options that are very close by.  However, it is very incosistent.  The past 3 times I have gone for lunch they have been out of something for the chicken cesear salad, but have not told me until I receive my order.  The first time they were out of parmesean cheese, the second time they were out of the usual sliced white meat chicken and replaced it with what appeared to be shredded leg meat and finally today they only had half a small to go cup of dressing.  All three of these items seem to be very important to making a salad that only has 4 ingredients.  If I would have known this upfront I would not order the cesear salad.  I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition, it seems a little pricey for what they offer.  I can pay $9 and get a better salad at many other places uptown, I guess they are able to charge for convienence. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to Pittsburgh.\n\nFirst, all of the food was extremely overpriced. The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack. \n\nThe service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her \""second day on the job,\"" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).\n\nRoland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Leave lots of time if you are using a rental car!  The rental car center is quite far from the airport and you have to wait for the shuttle.  No tram or alternate routes means at least 20 minute process. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is an amazing way to spend a fall afternoon. You will get your daily dose of exercise and more. My preteen daughter who normally only likes to brood in her room even enjoyed it. Great thing to do with your middle school aged kids. There were quite a few people there toting toddler age kids around on their backs. I thought they must have been crazy. Last place I would want to be is stuck in a maze with a cranky 2 year old. \n\nIt took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to get out and we promptly rewarded ourselves with some fried oreos from the food tent outside the maze. There are other things to do such as a hayride and corn hole. Plus they have soccer goals set up. Will be returning next year! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was feeling the need for a snack the other day and happened to be in the area of this little gem.  So I popped over to see what they had to offer, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The smell of fresh baked bread and other goodies meets you at the door, which is always fun.\n\nBesides the inviting smells, the employees are super nice.  Even though all I bought was a cookie they offered me a free taste of one of their other products (btw the pecan sweet bread is awesome).  Plus I liked the open layout of the place.  You can watch as they pull the bread out of the oven and wrap it up for you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For a sports bar located blocks from Chase Field and US Airways Arena, I don't know how they get away with having so much non-Phoenix sports memorabilia on the walls.  Only in this city!\n\ni was in here *after* a DBacks game and it was practically empty.  They have a decent enough draught selection.  But the place itself is kind of skeevey.  The bathroom was gross and there's a window at eye level across the wall with the urinals so you can look out into the bar (maybe to keep your eye on the game?).  But it means other people can look in.  Strange.\n\nThey were showing the ASU game at the time and the TV I was seated in front of had a terrible fisheyed picture, it almost made me nauseous.\n\nFeh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I decided to go see a movie this past Sunday & wanted to grab a few appetizers before heading that way. We walked over to Upstream to check out the menu and immediately loved their options! \nWe headed straight for the bar where we were greeted immediately and requested two waters and two menus. About 5 minutes later we were still without waters or menus & our bartender was nowhere to be seen (there were only about 3 or 4 other people sitting at the bar)...so I had to go to the host stand to look for some. \nWe each ordered the lobster bisque and decided to share the sweet and sour calamari. The lobster bisque came out lukewarm which made it completely unappetizing and had one small piece of lobster in the middle that turned out to be rubbery when we went to eat it!!!\nWe moved on to the calamari which was AMAZING and delicious!!!! Unfortunately, it was a pretty small serving for what we were paying so again we were disappointed but this time with the quantity.\nWhile dining our waters actually sat empty for pretty much the entire time the food was in front of us...very frustrating! We finally flagged down a server who was passing by to fill us up, which she did, BUT was not happy about it which she made very obvious with the annoyed long loud sigh she let out as she walked away. \nThroughout our meal not a single person stopped to check and see if our food was good or if we wanted to order anything else. We were never spoken to after our order was taken and had to flag someone down to request our bill. \nMy boyfriend and I eat out ALL the time and usually spend somewhere between $100 - $400 for dinner each time we go out (which is at least once a week). This time we were in and out diners who were excited to test a new place for a potential new date spot...they failed completely! We can forgive soup being lukewarm or even overpaying here and there....BUT not being completely ignored like we had no place dining there because we were only ordering a few quick appetizers and water. Best of luck to other diners, we unfortunately must have come on a bad night... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Maybe it's because I was drinking heavily (which is NOT a usual occurance!) but I really liked this little hole in the wall!  The server was fantastic!  She kept our glasses filled at just the right times (which was way too many!)  I don't think most people tip well here because she was shocked with a good cash tip. (So when you go...be nice and tip well!)   The bathroom was clean, the music was great!  The band was ReGroove, and it was just a fun night!  The clientele was interesting ;o) Drinks were pretty strong and cheap!  We'll be back for sure! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a pricey Japanese grocery store with a wide variety of goods.  I know it better as our Saturday go-to place for BENTO BOXES.  Oh yes, they are so good.  They are made fresh daily by the nice Japanese mom and pop that own the place.  They make sushi as well and it is expensive but it really does taste a million times better than the Giant Eagle stuff.  They also sell SASHIMI grade fish so we tried our hand at sashimi cutting one afternoon as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is a legit bubble bath for your ride, there isn't anything worse than pushy salesman at a car wash.  My little car needed a scrubbing and they did great! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Fletcher's is a joke.... I went there for and oil change and they convinced me to buy 2 get one free. So my total out the door was $40. Well making this next appointment was the worst!!!!! I called everyday at 8am for there stupid same day app. crap and somehow they were already booked for the WHOLE day or didn't answer. I went in to get the refund for my other one I purchase and they would only give me 8$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I should have gotten $20. The guy gave me so much attitude when I said fine I'll take the eight buck. But I have obviously can't get any help from them so it's 8$ or nothing! They also did nothing to try and accommodate the annoying situation they put me in . <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two, as our dinner entree. The Calamari was uneatable and the Ravioli was just down right nasty. The wedding soup was the worst I have ever had. The meat balls had absolute no taste, kind of like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted no different than Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce, you had to search for any meat or cheese. Our garlic bread came out literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We will not be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This used to be on my very short list of \""favorite\"" restaurants. Everything was perfect - except the Pad Thai (I am a traditionalist when it comes to Pad Thai and it's not realy Pad Thai at fate, the noodles and the sauce are wholly different).  \n\nThe crab puffs were amazing, the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm.  I even enjoyed the loud music next door, the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty.,  Loved it.  \n\nI am sad to see this place die out. I have NOT visited FATE since SENS opened up - I was hoping SENS and FATE would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas, FATE moved on without Jonny and that was a huge mistake.\n\nSee my review of SENS.  That place just keeps getting better and better.  I am addicted.  We go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Most of this airport seems really nice. The security wasn't bad, but it was late afternoon, so I think we caught a good time.\n\nI, however, got stuck in the Delta terminal, and it was the worst airport experience of my life. First of all, there was a Starbucks that closed at six pm, y'all. SIX. There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.\n\nThe lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside. It was tiny, old, and definitely not built for the 21st century. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hallelujah! This is the type of Italian I have been looking for. It's almost like sitting in  a kitchen.\nSmall place, maybe 10 tables, plastic chairs, paper table coverings, menu written in chalk on boards in front. Fresh pasta on Fridays and BYOB with a $3 cork fee. Hot damn! I got the lobster ravioli (holy garlic it was good). Also tried the mozzarella so fresh and spongy, drizzled in evoo and balsamic... Yum.. Had to try the tiramisu disappointed by the small portion but little miss piggy had eaten enough so it was probably a good thing. If you don't like this place go to Olive Garden, it may be better suited for your taste duds. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> By far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Its not a weekly stop because frankly I need a place to live and a car to drive (and eating here all the time would make me poor) so its reserved for special occasions, or a once every few months becasue I miss it so much and have to go back, type of place.\n\nThe menu changes seasonally, except for some standards like the mussels and the roast chicken entree.  I like that it changes except for when I've had something so delicious I want it the next time I go and its gone =(\n\nFavorites have been the monkfish with lobster tempura and bok choy, a mixed greens salad with sweet potato fries, the pea soup, the corn soup, the lemon mascarpone cake (I dream about this), striped bass, flounder, the grouper with \""clam chowder,\"" the cosmos, I swear they make them the best I've ever had.  I could go on and on but I honestly can't remember every dish I've ever had what I do know is not once have I left and felt like my meal was medicore.\n\nService is professional but also not pretentious.  I love when a server jokes around with the table but is not so intrusive that they act like we're all new BFF's.  And that is exactly how they deliver at Barrington's.\n\nYes its small and yes its pricey but like I said its not a daily/weekly type place to eat out at.  I went in May and June and now that I am talking about it my stomach started growling and I want to go now!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Possibly the worse service ever. I love their wings but for this simple experience, I will never go to Hooters again. Went there for the zombie walk and ordered wings and food. \nMy party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.\n\nOrdered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. \n\nThe pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. \n\nOk so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! \n\n* A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.\n\n* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! \n\n* The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! \n\n* Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. \n\nPrice range in Yelp language is $$\n\nI definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Perfect Day, Perfect Brunch, Perfect Place. \nYes that would be at the Coronado Cafe. \n\nStopped by on a Saturday afternoon and was pleased to see that they offered brunch as well as lunch. \n\nEvery thing sounded so goo it was hard to decide but I ended up getting a brunch item, the Crabby Benedict (see pics) which was two poached eggs over toasted focaccia, topped with blue crab, avocado, & hollandaise, served with caf\u00e9 potatoes & fresh fruit. \n\nOur food arrived fresh and on HOT Plates, I Seriously LOVED every bite and my daughter had The Biscuits and Gravy (see pics) and she cleaned her plate as well. \n\nWe sat outside and really enjoyed the patio, I'll have to go back to check out the inside on another Perfect Day! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ideal small, intimate resort with stellar service!  They earned my repeat business.  If you're looking for a large, 5 start Ritz Carlton, go to the Ritz.  If you're looking for a gorgeous setting with a Tuscan vibe, gardens, fountains, nooks crannies and one-on-one service it's ideal.  It's not perfect, but as a frequent traveler it wins in my book!\n\nResort fee covers all tips - not a usual perk!  Employees still go above and beyond.  Michael S. In valet, Robert and Matt at pool all extraordinary.  We didn't want for anything.  Parking is $15 for one vehicle but only a one time fee and you can go in and out.  This is also a deal for resorts.\n\nWe had a travel zoo voucher and were on a tight budget so we used food credits in Mix up Bar.  Great wine, good food but very limited and neither Mix Up or TJ Cooks good for vegans.  TJ Cooks well known and smelled delicious and I'll eat there next time when not on budget travel.\n\nPool great, but smaller so reserve chairs early.  We never waited for service or water or towels!  These are the perks of smaller property!  Water was very cold but would be good in hotter weather.  Hot tub was too hot to use.\n\nSince we were on a budget we didn't get to use our $40 spa credits because it was limited to massage or body work for 50min or more.  We did get to do free yoga class which was awesome!  Will be better outside when bugs aren't biting.  We also got to use steam room (even though we didn't get services - another perk of smaller property.)  Spa smaller but luxurious with amenities, steam room, showers, small private hot tub women only, and good lotions.\n\nMy only complaints were room service dishes all over property and not picked up despite employees out and about.  And better vegan food options.  That sent us off property to close restaurants.  Either way I'll be back.  Rooms were great, romantic, big beds, robes, big bathroom, dressing room, separate bag area and nice showers.  Check for tub if you want to take a bath.  Don't hesitate... great place! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I like CLT. I flew through here on my way from Philadelphia (my least favorite airport) to Fort Myers, FL, because it was cheaper. And I'm glad I did.\n\nThe way the airport is laid out in general is cool. Plenty of moving walkways too. Lots of good food options, and there's no lack in Starbucks. I did, however, get in the longest line, but it moved quickly and the workers were very happy and were even singing. :D\n\nThe Charlotte hub has to be my favorite for US Airways, since I hate PHL and I haven't been to PHX. Other than that, I'll be back! :D <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Bought custom suit and shirt here for my wedding... Peter took care of me. Very happy with product. Phenomenal service.   I returned and exchanged some products with no problems... Better quality and better prices than their bigger competitions like men's warehouse and Macys.   Trust me I looked everywhere.   Stop in and give them chance <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not impressed at all <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here with several friends after a Happy Hour across the street in The Biltmore. I ordered one of their daily specials, a grilled fish sandwich with a side of curried corn and white beans. The meal was tasty, but then one of the other Happy Hour participants started raving about their chocolate sundae. So I split one with my friend across the table. He didn't lie. That sundae was PHENOMENAL! And OH so very decadent and (most likely) bad for you. It comes with a carafe of extra hot fudge (PURE EVIL!)...absolutely delectable! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm not really sure if this is the right ROLBERTO'S that we ate at but it was really really good so if they are a chain and all related you really can't go wrong. It was funny because I really like a place called ROBERTO'S  and one of our friends we were with was a local and she said oh we have ROBERTO'S here and I was sold right then and there, and then when we pulled up I said \""hey this isn't ROBERTO'S it's ROLBERTO'S\""  this was entirely too funny to us and I hope you can appreciate the humor. \nThe story aside the food delivered and we enjoyed it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have ordered hot subs and for some reason they don't understand that not everyone wants white american. I gave them two chances and they haven't gotten it right yet! I will go to Sub Station across the street from now on! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've heard they officially changed their name to Big Pile of Crap. \n\nI'm sorry. I know this is a discount store. I'm not expecting cappuccino and Evian while shopping, though it would be a lovely touch.  But could you sweep the floor? I mean you sell brooms for God's sake. \n\nI did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles. \n\nReally? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen, if I ever stop by again, I'll bring my Swiffer. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I used to go to Churchhill's all the time for my smokes, but this place is closer and upon first glance, cheaper.  My inaugural experience was with my stogie-smokin' buddy Dave R.  We went right after the gym (natch) to get our supplies for that evening's drink fest.  Dave's been getting us our Ghurka Grand Reserve (amazing smoke) here for a while but I'd never been to the shop before.  They had a great selection of stogies and I picked up a new kind of Ghurka (for me anyway), a Ghurka Evil Torpedo.  Damn, it was good!\n\nThe proprietor was helpful and very friendly. I loathe connoisseur snobs of any kind and I feel like I often get that sideways, supercilious glance when entering cigar shops or wine stores -- not here.  100% helpful.  I did confound the poor guy as he was ringing us up when I was explaining to him that Dave was the Mayor of the shop on Foursquare.  Oh wells...\n\nGonna hit this joint again today for some Labor Day refills. Happy Smokin'! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it, I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.\n\nThe menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.  \n\nThey have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I thought this place was kind of a ripoff and the food was mediocre at best.  I got the arroz con pollo and a large drink for just over ten bucks which I personally thought was a lot, but I got a couple salsa cups and took a seat.  The salsas were okay I guess, one is called casera and it sure tasted like the Herdez Salsa Casera you get at the grocery store.\nMy lunch arrived and it wasn't quite the arroz con pollo I'm used to.  The rice was completely devoid of flavor, the chicken was a very small portion of thigh meat simply grilled which tasted okay but certainly nothing to write home about. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well it is the best. For me that is. It just came to me that I have never seen a male working here, do they? The women are very friendly and beyond patient, they have to be if you ever watched some people pick out a box of candy. I would be slapping them up against the wall. It is a nice open store with an abundance of product all of which I have eaten much too much over the years. I love the chocolate but I crave the peanut brittle it has to be taken away from me in order not to eat until I puke. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible service!!! Don't ask for them to quote you a price before your grooming service. They will quote you low and then give you the \""but once you get here the groomer will let you know what it will be for sure\"".... Once I arrived they originally quoted me $47 and the groomer said NO its going to be $83.... ? Never will I take my pets here again!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BEWARE!  Had a full detail done inside and out. Then go back about a month later for just a wash. The guy was annoyed that I wouldn't buy extra services (even though I explained it was all done the previous month) \n\nLeft my car, went in to pay and wait on other side for my car. Since my car was second in line for the wash I thought it strange that I had seen a minimum of eight cars come out and mine not one of them. \n\nI walk back to the beginning to see what they did with my car and sure thing there were another four cars in front of it! \n\nThey must have had to do a lot of car jockeying to get it behind the next dozen or so that came in after me.\n\nWhen brought to their attention they totally don't care or listen to what is going on. Very defensive and unbelieving this could ever happen. \n\nAs we all know (should know) what goes around comes around and Karma will get you every time. \n\nThey made the headlines tonight.  They are being served warrants for search and arrest of many with the business by the FEDS. \n\nGOT TO LOVE IT !!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible service! We were overcharged thanks to the waiters inability to split a bill - each couple on a separate tab - a normal thing to do in a restaurant - NOT HERE! They tally up the whole table and divide by the number of credit cards given and charge each one the same amount regardless of what each couple ordered. Do not make the mistake of going with friends and expecting the restaurant to be able to give separate tickets seems you have to sit across the room from each other and pretend not to know each other in order for that to be possible. Food was not what it used to be. Will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK, so there's nothing horribly bad or incredibly wonderful about this airport, but the restroom attendants are totally creepy.  They're also unnecessary--there are plenty of airports that don't have creepy attendants and which have pristine restrooms.  The last thing I want in a public bathroom is some overly enthusiastic dude getting all up in my grill wishing me a wonderful day and trying to push paper towels into my hand.  The obnoxious obviousness for tips is annoying as well.  Why should I help subsidize the salary of an airport employee just because I took a whiz?  Get rid of these dookie denizens so people can do their business in peace and not get hit up for cash. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would not recommend staying at the Ritz. \n\nWith all of the great resorts and hotels in the valley, there are better options for the money. \n\nI purchased a two night stay as part of a charity package in the expectation that what I was to receive was something special. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the lobby and the bar are extremely classy and ooze Victorian elegance. \n\nThen we got to our room...\n\nFirst red flag that this wasn't going to be a Ritz experience, and a sign that you are generally getting shafted is when they stick you in the room that is right next to the elevators (723 to be exact). \n\nAside from marble in the bathroom, you couldn't tell you were at a luxury hotel. That said, the bed was very comfortable. \n\nRed flag number two were the little cards around the room that asked us to participate in their environmental program and expect the room to be turned over once every other day and to reuse towels/etc. So, no fresh towels the following day. \n\nI thought this wasn't a big deal as they had a locker room off of the fitness center. However, to call this a \""center\"" is laughable. I'd call it a fitness boutique. Two showers, two sinks, a sauna and by far the cheapest complimentary products to use. $1 White Rain on a marble counter top isn't classy. \n\nNo spa, no salon (I was told I could leave the property and go across the street if I were looking these types of services). Not very helpful if you are traveling and need to get ready for a wedding or other formal event. \n\nThe over-the-top moment occurred when I reviewed my bill to find that they were going to charge $27 per night for overnight parking. When I asked how in the world they could charge such a fee I was told it was because we were in a highly congested area in Phoenix. Give me a break! It once again smelled of cheap. \n\nOverall, I thought the Ritz is largely capitalizing on its name and short-changing its guests where ever it could. With all of the other luxury options in the city, don't bother staying here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I give the 2 stars because my therapist is the one that deserves the stars. I was very disappointed in the way my appointment was handled. I requested the apt online first and in that request I mentioned I had just ran a half marathon. They called to make the apt, but had to leave me a message. I called them back explained I had ran a marathon again and scheduled the apt. Turns out, when I checked in, they told me why didn't I schedule a hour and half apointment instead of just the hour. I didn't know why they asked this, but it turns out, the extra half is comped for those that ran the pf chang marathon.  They missed telling me this information 2 x's prior. They asked if I wanted to re-schedule my appointment so I could take advantage of that promo......NO I am sore today!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Perhaps I was possessed.  Perhaps I was having a moment of Hellenic pride.  Maybe I wanted to feel like I was on the island of Chios smelling the marina and humming along with all the traditional anthems.  Perhaps I was hoping to break a few plates after toasting a wonderful plate of desperately sought out seafood in the desert.  I am not sure what it was that night I simply had to have Greek food. I had a dream is more than an ABBA greek tribute.  But here is my reality...\n\nHaving recieved awesome directions not thanks to my Garmin which placed the restuarant to the right versus the left off 19th and Camelback, but from the owner's wife, I pulled into an empty Tuesday night parking lot about an hour and a half before closing.  Perhaps this was my very first mistake but with this economy, I realized that the place might have been hurting more than my yearning for horiatiki and tzatziki.  Still, the women's voice was alluring and authentic and promising.\n\nEnter stage left, a host.  Truly, I thought  that I was part of an elaborate prop set for what would be a Greek tragedy.  The place is certainly capable visually of transporting you to Ellada.  The place was also as barren as an off season tourist trap near Plakka.  The two other people there seemed to be regulars.\n\nI admit that I was VERY impressed with the menu.  Again promising.  I went ahead and ordered Ktopodi traditional and kalamarakia.  Homemade bread that was made the last time the restaurant was full appeared at the table with sweet butter that was also frozen at that same time.  A wine list featuring more Greek wines than anyplace else was also promising, but I knew I would have a long drive back and well, you know me and that speeding thing on Interstate 17...I digress...\n\nAfter waiting for almost 25 minutes, I got one tentacle of  what must have been the world's smallest octopus and that octopus was suffering from anorexia.  It was camoflauged in a sea of fava bean paste to give it a fuller appearance.  It was dry and not tasty.  To be more clear... imagine a child's finger being grilled and placed in front of you after being dehydrated.  Yea.  That is what it was like.\n\nThe salad was fair.Meek, but fair.  Nothing to really yelp about.  The kalamarakia were horrid.  I think they were anything but fresh as they were laden in overly fried onions and sopping in oil with the breading stripping away.  I must have been desperate for the fruit of Poseiden to be enticed in any way to put a forkfull of this stuff in my mouth.  It was the absolute worse that I have ever experienced.  Hands down.  \n\nI am certain from the many posted accolades all over the walls of the place, that the GreekFest was indeed great.  But its day has come and gone and its legendary service and cuisine is all but a page of mythology.  I was extremely disappointed.  I am only giving two stars because the server was ok and the setting and music was so authentic.  I can only beg the Marvrides to consider a return themselves to their heritage of excellence that seems now so far away. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The food was amazing, good prices, service, and music. Plan on going back there very often. It's a great place to have breakfast or brunch. They do close at 230, so make sure you wake up early and get some food (: <|endoftext|>

I couldn't even begin to count the number of times that I have been to this place. I mean it when I say everything is delicious.  I have had multiple curries, noodles, and apps, and none have disappointed.\nA few of my favorites, Chicken Dumplings (steamed or fried), Thai Spring Rolls, Pad Thai (naturally), Thai Cuisine Bird Nest, and Spicy Basil Noodles.  \nService here is always on point, even when they're busy.  This place is BYOB, so bring your favorite adult bevie and enjoy. While a smaller restaurant, they happily can accommodate larger parties. \nWhile they don't deliver, you can get take out, so you can bring home a yummy Thai treat.\n\nI need to go here again asap!!! :) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Carl's cakes really should have more than 3.5 stars. I think partially the problem is a lot of reviews from bridezillas who didn't get their crazy expectations met. They admit to the great flavor of the cakes but then downgrade the stars because the shade of pink was wrong.\n\nAnyways someone had brought leftover wedding cake into my work lounge. I tried a small bite was amazed! Spent the course of the day trying to find out who brought this amazing cake and where it is from!  Turns out Carl's cakes and the flavor I tried was hazelnut apricot.\n\nI went to see what they offered at the market street diner in terms of variety. I was please that they have 4 or 5 cakes that you can get individual slices from but also a cooler with ready to go full cakes in a variety of flavors. I ended up getting a hazelnut apricot cake good for about 8 to 10 people for only 16 bucks. What a steal! Where can you get a awesome cake for that price nowadays. \n\nThey also do cheesecakes which I know will lure me back at some point. <|endoftext|>

One word: Forensics. They had a \""CSI\"" type of exhibit, and although I'm not a fan of the show, I thought it'd be cool to go since I'm so enthusiastic about forensic science.  I was quite disappointed perhaps because they had everything that I already knew (life cycle of a blow fly), stages of decay, etc. But also because it was quite small in size.  For the kids it was pretty awesome with all the maggots and bugs, and if you're a fan of the show, maybe. *It's gone now though. i didn't join Yelp until recently*\n\nI must say that they utilized as much space as they could with 3 stories.  My bf and I had a blast at the different exhibits, especially the Physics themed one with pulleys and puzzles.  Other than that, I think I wouldn't go back unless they had some cool new exhibit.\n\nGiven its location, I think the residents of Phoenix might enjoy one visit to the Science Center just to see what it's about...\n\nFor tourists, I'd suggest going to a different museum.\n\nPROS: Fun exhibits, good for kids/teens\nCONS: Small, once you go, you've seen it all, not worth going again unless something spectacular is happening. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just bought a latte and child's hot chocolate, and both were good and the smell of the place is awesome... I coffee beans! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seriously terrible work. I have never reviewed a place before but feel so strongly that people shouldn't waste their money here. The staff is rude and the nail I went in to have repaired looks absolutely terrible. Thought since they were closer than my normal nail place I would just go there since I just needed one repair, never again!! The one nail looks so horrible! Don't waste your time or money! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible food. It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich...so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It has taken me tooooo long to come here.  That may be a good thing because now I am hooked.  Having been told early on that it is their soda fountain that shines and the food is just *meh*, I have only ever tried their ice cream and sodas.  Currently I am hooked on their floats and ice cream sodas.  So many soda flavors to choose from and a list of favorite flavor combos, it can be the nightmare of someone as indecisive as myself. \nTo date I really have only had their \""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\"" ice cream soda which is butterscotch soda with pecan praline ice cream.  Honestly the quality pecan praline ice cream makes this drink, with generous ribbons of caramel and toasted candied pecans mixed into creamy vanilla ice cream (thank you Thrifty!).\nMix all that goodness with the butterscotch soda and YUMMM!!  I went back to try it with butterbeer flavor and didn't find it much different but still as tasty.  \n\nHaving asked a few servers what their favorites were  I now look forward to trying the \""James Dean \"" and a \""Chocolate Egg Cream\"".... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks. \n\nThe first time I dined here, I was unimpressed with their lobster roll (which is simply a hollowed-out white roll filled with lobster.  bread and seafood, that's IT).  Today, I was unimpressed with everything.\n\nExcept the woman two tables over who laughed like cigar-smoking circus clown and looked like Patrick Swayze in drag.  That was pretty awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For the past 15 years or so, I have been a satisfied and happy customer of KKL.  I absolutely love everything about Knock Kneed.  The fish is among the best that you will find in the Phoenix area.  I am also a big fan of the okra.  \n\nThe ambiance here is also quite enjoyable.  There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kind.\n\nYou can't go wrong here! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stopped in this morning at Paddy Cake Bakery to sample some donuts/treats/whatever caught our fancy. It wasn't the nicest place on the inside, and the ordering process seemed kind of chaotic. It looked like they did have a \""take a number\"" kind of system, but weren't using it when we were there. I ended up getting a cinnamon roll and a cake donut, as I couldn't decide and we were heading to the gym anyway, so I didn't feel guilty. Wife got a chocolate frosted longhorn style donut that was covered in sprinkles. I feel like a good measure of a place that claims to have amazing donuts is their plain cake donut. If you can do this properly, then good things are to come when you order other things. This was probably the worst plain cake donut I've ever had. It was dry, not at all crispy, and had no flavor. I couldn't even finish it. And I love pastry. I would have rather had a cake donut from Giant Eagle or Dunkin Donuts, and that's a sad statement. Those are honestly better. The cinnamon roll was just ok, until I bit into the center, where the dough was almost raw. I understand not wanting to over cook your cinnamon rolls, but this was not a fun surprise. I sampled my wife's donut as I wanted to be able to comment on it, and I found the chocolate icing to be artificial tasting. This is the first time I've eaten donuts and thrown pieces of everything away.\n\nThis place was...well, edible. I didn't find it to be anything special. We didn't sample the cookies or cakes, but if the donuts are any indication, I don't want to try them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Over all the food was good. I ordered chicken and 2 sides. Collard greens and mashed potato.  I went on a thursday night and had to wait about 35min for food I ordered to go. The place was packed so that normally says that the place is good. And I don't have any complaints besides the wait. Good news was they had a bar next door so I went and had a beer then came back to get food. But had to wait another 15min. Well I actually did not like the greens it was very plain no flavor. The mashed potato was very good though. I would deff go here again for a cheap light meal. Oh yes I also ordered banana pudding. That was ok nothing I would order again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First time here and they locked the keys in the car.  Instead of calling a locksmith they spent 30 minutes trying to open the door. I finally tell them to not touch the car and to call someone. They asked me to call triple a, which I don't have and I was irritated cause this was their fault so they should call. Two hours later, I got in my car and left, never to return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Only gave them a star because there is no option for \""0\"" or negative stars! I have been going here for about a yr but this last time i had the WORST \""oil change\"" experience OF MY LIFE! I will NEVER be back and would advise everyone to reconsider before trusting them with your vehicle!\n\n I recently took my vehicle in for an oil change, and they talked me into doing a 3 point fuel injection cleaning saying that it would help my car run better and give me better gas mileage. I agreed to this service thinking it would help my car, but after they were finished they said they were only able to do part of the service because one of the parts had mesh over it. (So they didn't even do the full 3 point service) \n\nMy car was running perfectly fine and had not given me ANY problems before this service. However, before I even left the parking lot my car was shaking when my foot was on the brake and the check engine light was flashing and beeping. I had to go pick my son up as I could not leave him at school and then immediately proceeded to go back and ask them what they did and if they could fix it... by this time the car's heat gage was beginning to rise. \n\nThey spent about 5 minutes trying to see what was wrong and then told me that they couldn't figure out the issue. They said I should take it next door to Big O tires and if they did something wrong then they would pay for it because they \""stand behind their service 100%.\"" \n\nBig O tires took and entire day to run a diagnostics on it and then called to tell me it was a blown head gasket and a misfire in Cylinder 4 and that although it may have been caused by the work they did there's no way to prove it.  I then got a call from Valvoline to let me know that they would not be paying for ANY of my repairs (which total $1,800.00!!!!) because there's no proof they messed up. So what was originally supposed to be a $40 oil change actually ended up costing me over $2,000.00 when you add in the price of the rental car I had to get, the cost of the service and the cost of the repairs... And they never once even offered to refund the money for the botched service they performed.\n\n I would advise everyone to stay far away from this facility!!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My most favorite Sushi Restraunt ever!  The freshest sushi in the valley! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here several times and just finally got the time to tell everyone about the delicious food this place has to offer. \n\nI have eaten a variety of their plates and everything has been amazing. Their cocktail shrimp is great. Shrimp and Pescado ceviche is clutch! I enjoyed every bite. Camarones a la crema de broccoli is amazing. I thought it sounded weird at first, but once I digged in I wanted more after each bite. I really want to try every plate!\n\nMy 5 year old nephew is a VERY picky eater. I don't think he's ever tried seafood and liked it, but I somehow got him (okay forced him) to have camarones a la plancha once. Whabam! He LOVED the camarones a la plancha. He refuses to eat any other shrimp if it isn't like how playa hermosa prepares them.\n\nWent during happy hour and got SUPER CHEAP Negra Modelo. They have soccer games playing, so enjoy a nice michelada or beer watching your favorite team. \n\nThe service is great too. The owners are super nice. They really care about their customers. \n\nThe place is in shady looking area, but don't let that frighten you. The place is a diamond in the rough. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Edit: New ownership noticed 2008. \n\nTasty Indian cuisine with a British influence. Pub side has mostly British ales and are served in traditional, Imperial pint glasses.\n\nFood is average and in line with most Indian Cuisine in the Phoenix area. Chana Masala with garlic naan is an exceptional combination at this location. Appetizers are high quality as well. \n\nPrices/portions are on par for most restaurants.\n\nService is about average as well - sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes poor. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm sad to say that after a really great first experience over one year ago, Friday night's dinner at Monty's was very disappointing and I probably won't come back any time soon.  The host at the counter was not friendly.  My sandwich came on bread that was literally hard as a rock and then my husband was done eating before I even started my dinner because I sent it back and waited for new bread. The bread the second time around was greasy and the sandwich itself was dripping in grease.  GROSS.  My husband ordered the fish fry and they forgot part of his order.  It was just a bad day for Monty's....I might be back for dessert someday. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I consider Monterrey the standard for really good 'dive' Mexican food.  There is nothing gourmet about it and you can order by number.  The menu comes with pictures and you get a side of refried beans with almost everything.  The waitstaff is friendly and actually speaks Spanish. And the salsa - oooh how I crave the salsa.  Whenever I'm in town, I require a trip here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here hankering for a real deli experience (e.g. chompies/ east coast style), but I was willing to settle for just a decent sandwich.   I ordered a turkey sandwich and got dry bird on a tasteless, tacky bun that induced grade school cafeteria flashbacks. I consoled myself with the fact that I at least had a pickle to munch on.  but alas! I bit into a revoltingly limp, fetid-smelling, gag-inducing gherkin not fit for consumption.   I had to spit it out in my napkin like some priss---a sorry thing for a woman who likes to chow down.   well at least I had some water....\n\nmy advice: go an extra mile to steer clear of this glorified cafeteria. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \""Best Burger in Pittsburgh\"" lists than not, and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.\n\nThe ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \""medium rare\"" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.\n\nThough shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger, try Burgatory.) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was one of the few times Yelp has led us wrong. Came here because it was close by & had 4 stars. \n\nI will say the service was perfectly fine. Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. \n\nUnfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.\n\nThe sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. \n\nThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.\n\nThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!\n\nA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a good value.  For about the same money as my medium sized mint oreo blizzard, I can get a scoop of real mint ice cream at Sweet Republic with cookies mixed in.  And it will be top quality, too.  Unlike the blizzard I got that was mostly melted yet still wasn't mixed well, so it had this nasty green mint slime swirled in it.  What really ticked me off was the lack of oreos.  I counted 5 (five!) little chunks of oreo.  The store was clean and the guys behind the counter seemed nice, but I'm still sorry about the purchase. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I took my parents out to celebrate the Christmas season.  My mother ordered the petite filet mignon, which she thought was very good.  The sides we ordered - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, were also good.  However, my father and I shared the porterhouse for two.  For $90, I would have expected a much better piece of meat.  Flavor was good, but It was tough.  There were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife.  In addition, the presentation was poor.  They put a big plate in the center of the table, then cut up the steak into 10 or 12 cubes.  These cubes were then cooked.  I could have done better at home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place..... cheap quality chinese food... everything i've had there is good. When they label an item as spicy, it is actually spicy! \n\n\nThere lunch specials are an awesome deal. 5 or 6 bucks for a plate of food, soup and fried wonton chips.\n\nlove it! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been to quite a few amusement parks...and this was by far the worst.\n\nI purchased my tickets, dining plan and parking ticket online thinking it would be the best way to go. We had no problems using our admission ticket or parking ticket. They actually eliminated a lot of waiting time.\n\nWhen we got into the park we grabbed a park map and got moving. This park is set up so strange. The map didn't even help. There was no rhyme or reason to where things are located. The rides were decent, bring Advil and a neck brace...you will need them after going on the coasters...\n\nHere's all the negatives:\n\n- Lines: No wait times are displaced. The \""rat cages\"" are not big enough to accommodate the lines, leaving people hanging out in the \""roads.\"" It's just one big cluster f*ck.\n\n- Dining Plan: We purchased this for $15.99 thinking we were going to save money. We had no problem using the passes for our meal...we each got a burger or sandwich, drink and fries. The snack was another problem. Even though it says \""restriction may apply\"" we were very disappointed in the signage letting us know what's allowed. You CAN get Dipping Dots...but only at a certain cart. Try finding that cart...I dare you. No one ended up with the snack they wanted, we wandered around the parking trying to find places we could use it. It turned out to be a bigger pain than anything. SKIP THIS.\n\n- Workers: Rude, rude, rude. I only encountered ONE nice worker that day. Take a hint from Disney...those people actually seem to enjoy their jobs.\n\n- 3D glasses: They make you pay for parking, food and tickets....and now they want $1 for 3D glasses. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\nThis was supposed to be a fun family day and it turned into a bigger headache than anything. We will not be returning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went in on a Tuesday evening. Place was pretty empty but that left plenty of parking so I wasn't deterred. Service was also pretty slow for it being empty. The older woman - owner? - who was waiting on some tables took awhile to get to us, though we were greeted at the door.\nPrices were a little higher than I expected (I was thinking a smaller Manuel's but the prices were a few dollars more than what I typically get there) but my chimi covered in fresh guacamole, sour cream and cheese was delicious. It also had a side of beans covered in cheddar and they were really good. Split a basket of chips with my friend and while the chips were great, I wasn't too keen on the salsa - it was a little more watery and more like pico de gallo than I typically like. I got a water with lemon that was good, it didn't seem like tap. \nOverall, I typical Mexican local restraunt experience. Great food but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tasty appetizers and dishes. Pungent sauces. Quick delivery. Excellent choice for Chinese food in Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Bad Ass Cajun.  \nCame in on a Friday and sat at the bar to get some Cajun fare.  I got the seafood gumbo and the half shrimp Po Boy.  Both were delish! Shrimp in both dishes was plump, juicy and that special crunchy fresh you dream of at night.  Sitting down at the bar, I talked to the tender and the guests.  Everybody was friendly and the tender even was calling me by name when I left.  I explained how much I liked the gumbo and she let me try the sausage and chicken gumbo on the house and it too was also a tasty classic gumbo delight.\nAll in all this was a down home friendly, classically Cajun experience that is now one of my favorites. <|endoftext|>

Also, if you like black hair as a garnish in your chicken makhani, you'll really enjoy it here. \n\nDisgusting. Threw out a $10 plate of food after finding hair. Not to mention when brought to the attention of the staff, there was no apology or anything to fix it. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the absolute worst place in Downtown Champaign (other than Phoenix), and I mean that in the best way possible. On a Friday night, the place was near deserted after about 10:30pm, with a regular or two, a couple of drunks and a group of quiet students. Seating is in cramped booths unsuitable for people taller than 6', or at the bar. The interior is hideous: bugly, dated paneling, linoleum and illumination by neon promo signs. My kind of place.\n\nThey have 2 beers on tap as I recall, PBR and High Life. The special that night was Hamm's cans, which were had for (surprisingly, to me) more than a dollar each. The good news is that either Hamm's is a lot better than I remember, or I was drunker than I thought. I had been drinking 'good' beer at other downtown establishments known for the same, but the Hamm's were somehow better. Thinking about how well those Hamm's hit the spot makes me want one right now.\n\nThe Brass Rail has an internet juke box to kill the otherwise oppressive silence, and is a total ripoff if you put less than $5 in, but has an impressive selection. They have a soft-tip dartboard, a couple of tvs and a broken pinball machine. They also have frozen pizza that they can make for you for less than $5, but it is pretty crappy pizza. Huber's' pizza is way better. Ours got burnt black in places and was too salty but  was still promptly devoured. For two days I wondered how I burned my mouth.\n\nService is great, and friendly. The bartender has an excellent rapport with her patrons, a quick wit and a kindness that comes across right away. I can definitely see this as a place to go back to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointing cakes.  The \""buttercreams\"" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \""buttercream\"" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that \""buttercream\""! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Why, hello, 99 cent margaritas.  \n\nI used to go here with a friend when I lived in the Biltmore area a year or so ago, and I lived and breathed off the shrimp and scallops del mar.  Nowadays, another friend and I like to frequent Arriba for their happy hour margaritas.  The chips and salsa are excellent, and although the servers speak hardly a lick of English, service is generally pretty good.  The food leaves something to be desired, excepting the shrimp and scallops del mar, as well as the chips and dip, but the drinks and service are awesome.  It's just the right place to drop by after a crappy day at work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What a great lunch spot. A nice selection and great service. We enjoyed the turkey club, which included great crisp bacon, and the grilled cheese with tomato & bacon, and fries. The sandwiches were great , and the fries hot and cooked to order. The place was packed and now I know why. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Items don't have price tags. That's the only reason why I gave them such a poor mark. I hope that caught their attention. \n\nI try to buy produce and a lot of times many of the items I seem to select have no price tags, price stickers, barcode, name of produce and per/lb info. none of that. It's not listed anywhere and when I ask an associate they themselves don't know. Now please don't try retraining them because your associates are very kind and generous this is a corporate issue. \n\nSame goes for milk, cold cuts and breakfast meat products. \n\nEggs sometimes have poor labels placed in odd locations confusing the customer and forcing them to go on an Easter Egg hunt for the right price. \n\n\nThey also have fake sales. Placing price tags that are actually higher then the week before and claiming 'you are saving'.\n\nIt's close and convenient. \n\nPrices are a bit high. \n\nAssociates are so kind.

Voicemail said that clients that had purchased packages would be contacted for refunds by the end of November, but I haven't been contacted about my unfulfilled pedicure package.\n\nHowever, I have located the owner of Salon 3121, Michelle Davis and she is now doing business at:\n\nNails by Michelle D\n3240 East Camelback Road Studio #4\nPhoenix, Arizona 85018\n\nIf you are awaiting a refund from Salon 3121, you can try contacting Michelle and see if she'll make good on your prior purchase.  Not sure if she's selling any new packages, but I'd be careful about advanced purchases.  Good luck. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First of all, Everyone I have introduce this place (and this is quite a few people) continue coming back over and over again. Best place for happy hour sushi weekdays from 3-6pm. If you don't like sushi no worries this place has you covered. Italian pasta dishes available. Suggestion: Try the spicy Tan Tan Ramen or the Yakisoba Noodles. Dessert is a MUST here. All desserts are made daily at the restaurant. I always get the Flan its creamy and caramel delicious! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Its Cuban and fun.  Where else are you going to get Cuban food? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love it! Been living near this place for most of the last thirty years, and finally came tonight.\n\nThey had salad, with ranch, or Italian (go figure), or vinegar and oil.\n\nThe pasta choices were;\nspaghetti, with meatballs, and red sauce;\npasta Primavera;\nbow tie pasta, with sausage, and Alfredo sauce\n\nThe meatballs were good portions, , and the red sauce was delicious.\n\nThe Primavera was good, but it's not really my gig.\n\nThe bow tie, with Alfredo, was delicious!\n\nThe bread was soft, with a nice crust.\n\nGlad I finally came, after seeing it for thirty years.\n\nGonna have to come again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One afternoon, as the All Stars were about to take to Chase Field and play America's favorite pastime, we stopped into Marjele's for a bite to eat. First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy as we took the patio and we proceeded to order food. Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day. But on this particular day, Dan Marjele happened to walk into Marjeles. The irony cracked us up because we knew that the out of towners probably assumed this is a regular occurrence. And hey, maybe it is! \n\nAnyway, this is the perfect bar to grab a quick and decent bite to eat before a sporting event downtown. The buffalo chicken is delicious, as is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and any other wrap on the menu. It's one or two notches above generic bar food and the drinks also flow nicely. They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very expensive and quantity was quite less. I am an Indian and I love Indian food but their food gave me hard time in digestion; I suffered for 2 days. \n\nPrice-wise too, I wound't order again when I can have whole buffet at Tamarind at less than half price. I ordered chicken curry, the one at Coriander Restaurant on Murray Ave is yummy but this one was so-so in taste, mostly disappointing. I also ordered Samosa, I find the poorly fried samosas of Bombay Mart better than these ones. Then I ordered tikki (aloo patty), really disappointed, it looked several weeks old reheated in microwave. I know from 24 years of experience how fresh tikki tastes like. \n\nI like Indian restaurants in this order: Uddupi, Tamarind, Coriander, Indian Carts at Pitt, even Yuva India and All India more than this one. But definitely it's better than Prince of India, where food smells like 2 week old and there is absolutely no taste in the food. <|endoftext|>

It was my first visit, too, and I enjoyed the exhibits and seeing a cultural part of the city that I hadn't seen before. \n\nTheir permanent exhibit is \""Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers\"" about the history of North Carolina and the way its changed from its beginnings.  It was very informative and by far the best exhibit we saw that day.  I loved the lifesize stores and rooms you can walk through to really get a feel of what it was like to live in NC from the Civil War to the present.  It was also a great history lesson in civil rights and how its evolved over the past 150 years or so.  We easily spent the better part of an entire afternoon there and felt good about doing so. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I called ahead to make sure they were open. They were easy to find. I was a little disappointed in selection but what they had was all very nice stuff at good price. I really liked that they were very laid back. They HELPED, but didn't PUSH like happened at a different shop. The reason I bought there was they let me TRY out the vacuum! If I am going to spend good money I want to try it first. Overall I was happy and God forbid this vacuum breaks, I will take it here to fix. I learned my lesson, keep your vacuum you like, they are hard to replace! <|endoftext|>

Sauce on the side.  The breast is a nice piece of smoked meat that they put on the grill for a minute to heat up when served.  Discard the skin and enjoy only the end chunk off the wing and you've got a pretty good high-protein lunch for under $4 for the paleo-diet oriented crowd. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Old equipment that is usually broken. There is ALWAYS at least one broken machine, usually cardio. The place is very dirty and smelly. The AC never seems to be working. The front desk staff are usually to busy being on their cell phones or talking to other staff to acknowledge you.  I'm considering driving to 43 ave and bell. That is a nice one! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had.\nWe started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!!\nIt hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!!\nWe thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious.\nThe quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste.\nThe service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile.\nI wish I could have this meal more often.\nI know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!!  :-) :-). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bought a set of Titleist golf clubs here about 6 months ago.  They just didn't work for me so decided to sell them to a broker.  Turns out the clubs were COUNTERFEIT.  Attempted to bring them into the store to get a refund but was only offered store credit.  Employee informed me that he is also losing on the deal since he has to know dispose of them.  I don't see how that would be a customer's issue, but my protests didn't matter.   I realize that they aren't a Titleist retailer, but it seems pretty unfair not to refund someone's money on counterfeit merchandise.  If they can't identify authentic equipment, I'd be extra cautious about buying any golf equipment from them (even with a store credit). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was in the mood for chicken teriyaki so the BFF & I decided to give Blue Fin a try today before the Suns game. From the looks of it, one would expect a dingy little hole in the wall, but it's actually very clean inside. I secretly did a happy dance when I saw shakers of Japanese chili powder and black sesame seeds on each table.. two of my favorite condiments! \n\nAs we approached the counter, we were greeted by a cheerful and helpful lady, whom I later deduced is the owner's daughter. My friend asked which dishes were the most popular and she said, \""chicken teriyaki, panko chicken, pork katsu and chicken curry.\"" I ordered the (dark meat) chicken teriyaki combo (comes w/ rice & salad) since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo (it's not on the menu, but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request). \n\nOur heaping plates arrived a few minutes later and we hungrily dug in. After the first bite, I realized I was kind of disappointed by the chicken teriyaki because the meat was very dry and it was heavily marinated in sauce. I think they gave me white meat, but we were short on time and the lady was busy serving others so I didn't bother asking. The BFF enjoyed his beef & chicken combo which doesn't surprise me since he's very easy to please when it comes to food.  \n\nI ate a few more bites so I wouldn't starve during the game and packed up the rest for the BFF to take home. Oh yeah, the salad was OK. Nothing special about it, but I should have figured it wouldn't be since it was only an additional $.80 from a regular teriyaki bowl. \n\nThe lady working was not only very nice & helpful when we ordered, but she also went above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food type place. She asked us once or twice if we're doing OK, asked if we needed more rice and as we were about to toss our plates, she offered to do it for us. I also noticed she was just as friendly to the other patrons.. even offered a guy a sample of the chicken teriyaki because he didn't know what to order. \n\nI'd really rate the food at 3 stars, but added an extra for the super nice lady. I'd give something else a try the next time I'm in the area just because she was *that* nice. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hands down, this is the best ice cream parlor in Pittsburgh. The ice cream is rich and creamy-- it has a distinct texture from other ice creams places... and it's miles away from store bought ice cream.... yuck. Even the presentation of your dessert is outstanding! \n\nThe decor is dated. It stands a fine line between the \""vintage\"" feel and just plain old. And it was in a sketchy area. I walked over from Chinatown, and there were no other businesses (or people) around. It's a diamond in the rough type place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Extremely nice and helpful! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Have tried both eating in and take out, and the food was tasty, hot and well prepared.  Friendly staff and restaurant seemed well kept up inside (a bit cluttered but I think they do mostly take out and delivery so ambiance is not what you are looking for).  The lo mein noodles and dumplings were great.  Definitely recommended for a good basic American style chinese neighborhood place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I decided to give Browne's a try after reading the positive reviews on Yelp.  I was looking for an engagement ring and had some very good options online, but I am willing to pay a little more for good costumer service and to shop locally. The first time I went to Browne's I received very good costumer care, the attendant took her time to explain the different grades of diamonds and all the different options available.  I felt so comfortable that I felt convinced that I should buy a ring from Browne's.  \nThe second time I visited Browne's I was attended by a different person, and my experience was the total opposite from the previous one.  The attendant's demeanor was condescending and snobbish, I felt like I was wasting this person's time, so I took my money elsewhere.  I conclusion, Browne's could be a store depending on who is working that day. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I consider myself a good fan of Panda Express, but at this location in not going again, I order like always my regular rice  with teriyaki chicken n cream cheese, but this time, the chicken wasn't ready so they told me I had to wait n that was fine for me I wasn't on a hurry, but I guess they tough I didn't want to wait, by the time I started eating I find out my chicken wasn't good it was acceptable but far away from the regular quality I can expect from them, but to make worst my rice didn't had any trace of salt. I went to the counter n I let the lady know about my findings, but she tried n said \""you're right Sir. it's unsalted but that's the way it is.\"" I definitely didn't expect that answer, my meal cost me around $8 n I was really hungry, so I didn't want the situation to escalate for that amount, but for sure my last visit to this location... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Have been eating here for 25 years. It used to my favorite place for barbecue. I ordered a half rack of ribs and the bones were soft and tasted awful. The waitress took it back to the cook. The cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib. I won't be going back sad to say. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is small with an large patio area. They have some ok teriyaki white chicken(needs more sauce kind of dry) and terribly flavorless chicken fried rice. The service was quick and nice but I wouldn't recommend dining there as it seems to be heavy traffic for drunks and homeless people (unless people watching of sadness is your thing)so you would be best to pick up instead.\n\nI doubt I go back since the place is only so so at best for two of my favorite things. The crab puffs were nice though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Another strictly pinball review. \nAround thanksgiving the Ideal was had Simpsons Pinball Party. SPP is a lot of fun but never lasts long at any one stop in Madison (first played it at the Plaza this past summer) because it always has mechanical issues going on. \nStopped in the other night to find Walking Dead (which you can also find at the Up North currently). I haven't seen a lick of the TV series, Walking Dead so I admit I'm missing something but this game was just plain boring in my book. 4 stars for having a functioning (and new!) pinball machine - I bet Walking Dead fans will feel differently than I do about this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries, and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger!  A great place to be drunk in, not so great to be hung over in...  They have your typical greasy spoon fare, so don't go if you're concerned about your health.  Otherwise, eat on brave soul, eat on! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has to be one of the most overrated restaurants... ever.\n\nSo this review is for dinner and maybe that is why I was so utterly disappointed.\n\nFood:\nBrushcetta- We sampled the artichoke, pesto with salmon, roasted red peppers with goat cheese, and the fig spread with green apple.  I mean all of them were decent nothing was amazing.  In fact, i think I could easily put together a couple of them myself and have them taste just as good if not better.\n\nNine Iron-  Once again, it was OK.  Nothing special at all.  Just exactly as was described on the menu.\n\nItalian Picnic Salad-  Once again, nothing special at all.  Could have made it myself.\n\nService:\nSo on vacation we tend to eat out.  This was our 4th dinner out in a row and the first 3 had impeccable service.  This place did not.  I felt like it was a lot of waiting and waiting more.   We ordered something they did not bring and when we asked for that something we waited and waited....  Servers were nice enough though but they didn't seem that busy on a Sunday night so I would have expected service to be better.\n\nAmbiance:\nServers-Well, the servers I would classify as Arizona hipsterish.  Like not real hipsters.  They should go to SF to see those.  But definitely trying to be hipsters\n\nPeople there- 30- somethings at birthday dinners mixed with 20-somethings on date.  And yes, we did witness a couple making out.  Once again this was 7pm on a Sunday. Spare me please.\n\nThe Place- First, we asked to sit inside because it was slightly cold.  Well they sit us inside but right next to the open half of the restaurant so it basically was sitting outside but without the heater.  Other than that it was cute inside.\n\nMaybe this place was more like 2 1/2 -3 but I was so disappointed with the food and ambiance that I have to round down to 2.  This place is probably great during happy hour but when you're paying full price, it's just so not worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Im very confused about all these good reviews.\n\nLast night my girlfriend brought me to Jt's, her boss said the wings were great. So I figured I'll try it.\nWhen we get there, the lot is filled, I figured this is a good sign. But that where the optimism ended.\nWe had to sit near the back, the smell and temperature were almost unbearable, but I figured I wanted to try the food. My girlfriend ordered wings, she wanted ranch, I only eat wings with Blue Cheese, then I get a burger and onion rings... And a coke. \n\nAfter a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well. \nThe waitress comes back a little later to let us know, there's no more onion rings.\n\nAfter a long wait, we finally get the wings, as she sets them down, thats when she lets me know there's no more blue cheese. If I was by myself, I would have left at that point, I was also hungry. \n\nMy burger came, it was one of those pre made paddies you get at cosco, I lifted the bun and the whole patty fell apart. The cheese was some sort of burned shredded cheese. \n\nI counted the 'fries' I received with he burger, I counted 12 small pathetic fries. \n\nThese wings everyone talks about were burnt and dry, this confuses me the most. \nI mentioned to my girlfriend that I don't think her boss likes her, people must send patrons there when they dislike them. \n\nWith all the places in the valley to get really good wings, good service and other good dishes, I put this mystery of why people rave about this place up there with the mystery of the pyramids... \n\nUgh, I still cant get the image of that sorry burger out of my mind! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've decided that this is going to be my new Sunday football hangout.    Nothing fancy, kind of a dimly lit place but they show all the football games, have a solid, good-quality menu, the burgers are decent, the prices are low, the service is top-notch and I can sit back, enjoy whatever game I'm watching and not be bothered.     I've been to their location on Thunderbird as well and this one by FAR is a lot better.     Not sure why it is, but the service seems better and the food sure as heck tastes better.   They make some pretty good BBQ here as well.     Not a gourmet dining experience but they live up to the expectations of a sports bar and then some. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came here on a recommendation from my Mom's coworker. I made a reservation for two pedicures at 2:30 on a Friday. My Mom waited a half hour before anyone came over to start her pedicure. As for myself, it is almost 3:40 and I still have not had anyone start my pedicure. Oh wait someone did remove my old polish and then she walked away. So I am still sitting here. Oh did I mention two women came in after me and are almost done with their pedicures. Yes they came in well after I was here and are almost done. Hmm that doesn't seem right. I am almost inclined to get up and walk away. Then the owner came over to finish my pedicure. Ugh. This is the worst customer service I have experienced at a nail salon. Not only that but the worst pedicure experience. I left with not even having my feet massaged. My suggestion, don't come here ever. Worst experience ever. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> triple decker toasted cheese sandwiches are on the menu.  that should be enough to get you in there.  also, they make tater tots crispier than breaded-deep-fried bacon served on a bed of captain crunch.  on tuesday nights they have acoustic live music which is always good.  see you there. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went to Umi last night, and it was tough to get a reservation, which is usually a good sign. But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really.\nWe began with the miso soup, which was some of the\nbest we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there.\nThe salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty.\nWe then moved on to the \""good stuff,\"" or so we thought...\nWe began with the highly-recommended \""yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce\"" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \""sushi entree (assorted)\"", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day.\nI was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places).\nNext to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining.\nOur waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it.\nWe concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \""sister-restaurant,\"" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh).\nOverall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far.\nSo insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale.\nTo people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime.\nIt's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special.\nI can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \""essence\"" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A summary of the high points - Better quality than other consignment places, nice staff, decent cash and credit for what you consign, great prices, especially for the \""bridge\"" brands like Ellen Tracy, Jones NY, etc.  I got a spectacular Ellen Tracy blazer for $8.  A CAbi blouse for $7.  Ann Taylor blazer for $11.  The real designer duds are of course $100+, but still a tiny fraction of the retail price.\n\nLow points - the place is weirdly organized, and the selection of larger sizes is pretty small.  I still haven't  figured out why there are three or four racks of jeans and several racks of blouses in different locations, and no racks of dresses...  well I'm sure there is one, but it's not anywhere obvious.  Also, the clothes on the designer racks are jammed too closely together and not separated by size, which makes browsing that rack so difficult I usually give up.  Also, they don't notify you when your clothes have sold, so remember to check in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  You must remember you get what you pay for. It's like a tattoo artist say, a cheap tattoo is not good and a good tattoo is not cheap. \nCigarette burns on the sheet, pubic hair under the toilet seat, hair on the edge of the bath tub, ash trays all over the room (when I specifically asked for a non smoking room), the room smelled so badly of cigarette smoke, some one was smoking the medicinal cigarette around my room. The office smelled of cig smoke, the plug behind my lamp didn't work, my phone almost died, the bed is so close to the A/C unit and it was on full blast but didn't make the room cold at all. Slept ok, the bed was fine. My toe ended up poking through one of the cigarette burns in the comforter. No more again. I don't care about the price at this point. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had to take my to-go order back 3 times because they got it wrong and the 3rd time, I took 5 bites of my salad before realizing there were crispy noodles in there that I SPECIFICALLY asked them not to put in because I have Celiac Disease and can't tolerate gluten.  Needless to say, I got very sick and am now home in bed instead of at work because of it. The girl at the take out counter, Tina, had the audacity to tell me it was my fault because she didn't hear me say it the second time I had to call back in because my order was wrong.  The 3rd time I went in after I realized I was going to get sick, I just asked for a refund.  The tall guy working was very nice and apologized over and over saying he would buy my meal next time but I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'll be honest--this place is good for Americans... but not good enough for Chinese people.  The waiters were sort of rude to us, despite our being able to speak their language.\n\nFurthermore.. what kind of authentic Chinese restaurant serves dinner out of plates? Blasphemy! Our table to had to go out of our way to get bowls! I'm surprised they had chopsticks.\n\nOtherwise, their mock  food was salty and pasty, perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement.  Wait.. salty and pasty? It's supposed to be a (insert meat type) dish, consisting of subtle flavors and intense chili pepper action.\n\nNeeext... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everything is super fresh whenever we go. Easy to fill a plate with healthy, delicious salad, but hard not to overheat! Their chili is also very tasty. We always try to eat there when we are in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great lunch spot. To repeat other reviews, the service is fast; probably the quickest I have ever experienced. As with most other locations I have visited, the staff is genuine and friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Finally, we found a place that has everything we want! A relatively shallow pool so I can practice my not-so-good backstroke, a deep pool to swim laps and get that water cardio, a cool water pool with 6-8 lanes, a heated pool, and best of all, an adult-only HOT TUB!!\n\nThe pool itself is really clean and the water is very clear. There were plenty of lifeguards around, and a group practicing scuba diving on one side. The warm shallow pool had a couple instructors giving swim lessons. I particularly liked having so many windows through which I could watch the rain pour while I happily swam in my heated pool and some cool artwork around the big pool. The hot tub is really nice. At first, coming from the cool water pool it felt too hot, but as my body got used to it, it felt great. They also have a fitness center which we did not try.\n\nThe locker rooms are pretty decent for a public pool. They were clean, had plenty of lockers, hair dryers, and a tiny dryer for swim wear, which I absolutely LOVED.\nIt costs $5 for adults if you are a resident of CharMeck and a family membership is $53 a month, $48 if you choose to draft. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Do not go here.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I know it is to be expected that chain food is not going to blow my mind, but I truly am not a picky eater.  I love chain food but this place is awful.  I doubt I will ever go back to a TGI Fridays at any location.\n\nWe got the 2 for $10 deal.  The appetizers were large, but nothing special, clearly just frozen and thrown in a deep fryer. I ordered some sort of pasta Alfredo with chicken.  It was one of the smallest portions I've ever gotten in a  restaurant.  The pasta was so overcooked it was mushy.  The Alfredo was caked onto the bottom of the plate, to the point were most of it would not come off.  The chicken was so overcooked I could barely cut into it. Not the mention the place is constantly crawling with college kids, making ti so loud you can barely have a conversation.\n\nSave yourself the time and money and avoid this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.\n\nForever skeptical.\n\nThat's too bad, I don't mind paying extra for better produce or better brands. But, I KIND OF mind getting extremely sick, so sick that anything I ever would vouch for goes down the toilet, with my vomit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> i had a fantastic experience here. I got to the shop just before they weer about to close, but the owner was very gracious about creating an arrangement for me. The flowers were lovely. I would make a special trip just to purchase from this shop again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I may not be a truck driver, but I do appreciate the portion sizes.  If you are looking for big cookies and other bakery items, be sure to stop here!\n\nI love their chicken and dumpling soup.  It's always warm, and hits the spot! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at TGI Fridays on Harris Blvd. Bottom line- the manager would not remove a charge from our bill for food they told us was at a discount AND wouldn't remove a charge for food we did NOT get. He also told me that customers were liars and he wouldn't believe that one of his employees would tell us something wrong. So just FYI - if u are a customer here u might want to rethink as you are a liar! Please share so others liars are in the know. \nNow mind you- this manager treated me this way all over $6.00. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Incredibly depressing store.  I get the feeling that it preys on a 'food desert\"" mentality, taking advantage of people in the neighborhood who don't have a car to drive to Schnucks or Meijer.  I bought two items.  Both were overpriced to begin with and wound up ringing up for even higher amounts at the register.   I won't be back anytime soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a cute outdoor shopping center, I had some time to kill so I went to Marshalls, Loft, the chocolate store and a few other of the small stores before getting dinner at Johnny's. Not bad! I didn't hit up on section because I couldn't find it :P  I also took the trolley home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I took myself out on a date to celebrate the end of the semester teaching at ITT at Maharani last night. Before I switched teams to be a fan of Woodlands, Maharani was my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. \n\nI enjoyed Maharani last night again. I had the Vegetarian Thali, which kind of gives you the experience of eating buffet even when the buffet isn't open. The whole meal was a little pricey ($25 with tip), but it was more than I could eat. I had leftovers today!\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious (if not quite as fabulous as Woodlands). I prefer to go to Maharani when there's a buffet, so I wish it had been the afternoon. It's great for lunch! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What an absolute dive, and not in a good way. The day I was so lucky to have gone there was a show of some kind with twinks bouncing all around on the stage with small briefs on, not attractive at all.  Now when entering it be prepared, it reaks of BO, sewer and garbage. I had to push my way through just to get past the entrance, once standing there trying to get my surrounding's, I'm pushed and bumped into as if I am not there. I cannot stand packed places, especially with shirtless, sweaty, smelly guys rubbing into me...yuck. I be-lined it for the patio for escape and stayed there until my friends were ready to leave. Just a awkward mix of very \""interesting \""people, not the most nice to look at, or trust to leave your drink for any amount of time. It's definitely not worth the olfactory assault to ever go in there again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love going here with my friends, I still have to bring my boyfriend here one of these days so he can try some good Mexican ice cream, a diablito, or fresas con crema. All the desserts here are great, I haven't tried their food yet, but i'm sure that just like everything else it must be great. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Gobble-rito!\n\nI love Mad Mex and all the offerings.   My favorites are the Wing-o-rito and Gobble-rito(when offered).\n\nThe Wing-o-rito has your beloved wing sauce mixed in their hefty burrito.\n\nThe Gobble-rito is their seasonal Thanksgiving burrito with a side of cranberry.\n\nBoth are awesome!   Schedule your training appointments or your purge because these are high-calorie affairs but worth it.   Top it off with one of their signature drinks and you cannot go wrong :)\n\nEnjoy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place was amazing!! The cucumber dill sauce for the salmon was out of this world!!! I've also never had cinnamon butter for my rolls before I came here. A must try if you are near by <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Carowinds is a wonderful amusement park and water park.  It is small enough that you can ride every ride in one day and large enough so you are never bored. Buying a Gold Season Pass is the way to go.  After 2 visits you have gotten your money's worth. Parking is free with the season pass, otherwise it is $15 each trip.  Carowinds has many trees and flowering plants everywhere.  Very easy to be in the shade when the sun gets too hot.   It is wonderful to have such a nice park here in the Carolina's!  Living close allows us to go there anytime we want, like having a theme park in our backyard! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been coming here since I started teaching down the road 5 years ago.  My friend suggested we get a mani/pedi and this place ended up being GREAT!  The staff is very friendly and professional.  They are very up to date with all the new nail services such as gel, shellac, and metallic.  The atmosphere isn't the best (not new), but its still nice.  The prices are amazing and they give the best leg/arm massages ever!!  I come to this place almost every month and have always left very happy!  :-) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A Wonder smokey mesquite smell hits you as soon as you open the door and walk in. \n\nThe price is right and the food is delicious. I've been here 5 times and had food catered once. If you're in the mood for Mexican food... This place is for you. With a large menu you have many choices. \n\nYou owe it to your taste buds to stop here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I just want to comment that I wrote to Urban Ministries from the volunteer page that said \""Create your own volunteer opportunity\"" and offered to go to several Room at the Inn sites every Saturday night during the winter months and set up mobile barber shops and cut as many heads as needed for my volunteer job. \nI was sent a rude reply asking if I was trying to make a paid opportunity. \nI laughed at first because I have been in the beauty/barber business for 30 years and I own a salon here. \nClearly I would not troll the homeless shelters for my money making opportunities. \nBut then I just felt sick and sad that all those men who might have needed those cuts for possible jobs, boost in self esteem, or simply some much needed human touch and a few laughs will lose out because one rude woman misread my email offer and shot off a rude response. \nI'm running the mobile shop for 3 Room at the Inn locations that I contacted on my own but to this day, no one from there has even acknowledged my offer. I guess they don't need anything from the community after all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of my favorite Thai places, maybe ever.  Fresh, sweet, spicy and all around good.  Not super heavy or cloying sweet.  Friendly service and all at a fair price.  \n\nI hate hearing my neighbors, though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Carrie's should merit a good-humored 3 stars for being a pleasant assortment of kitsch and delight in downtown Champaign, but in reality, it really does deserve 1 star.\n\nWhy, may you ask?\n\nImagine being a person of color who has just moved to Champaign.  You're new, confused, slightly nervous about everything.  And you stumble upon cool stores like Furniture Lounge or Jane Addams.  Great, you think, I'll find something fun and silly at Carrie's, no doubt.\n\nI enjoyed perusing the store until I exited with a friend, turned and looked at what was on display in the \""Half Price\"" shelf.  In the middle of the shelf, plain for all to see?  A Mammy Doll, everyone's favourite piece of standard racist darky imagery.  Note the coal black skin, scarlet lips, turban, hoop earrings, prodigious humps and lumps, and of course an apron, for all your serving needs.\n\nThat's right.  A Mammy Doll.  For Sale.  In Front. Of the Store.\n\nRight here: http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/KlYiE0VpuP5Qz3ThJ_rWzQ/l\n\nThe look on my face should really sum it up.  Except for the fact that whenever I was in downtown Champaign for the last month while walking to a coffee shop, I would glance nervously over to the half off shelf, and see of course Mammy.  EVERY TIME.\n\nNot OK.  Not OK at all.\n\nFinally, five weeks after this first began, I flipped.  Perhaps it was all the coffee at Aroma.  Perhaps it was the fact that in an area with an already awkward racial tension I was just over it.  But I grabbed the doll and marched into the store filled with self-righteousness and anger.\n\nAnd I thought, \""What the hell am I gonna do now?  Stage a sit-in?\""\n\nSo like any disaffected post-Sixties, post-Gen X kid would do, I bought it.  I paid $6 for a piece of outdated, racist iconography.  I emancipated Mammy.  (The Emancipation of Mammy--there's a title that won't be a Mariah Carey album any time soon.)\n\nShe now angrily sits on my coffee table, making people feel uncomfortable.  And I'm happier it's there than on display on the sidewalk for all passers-by to think it's okay to take.\n\nDo I feel comfortable that I bought it?  No, but I'm glad it's not just chillin' out there any more.\n\n\nAnd I officially hate Carrie's now.\n\nBut at least Mammy is free. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place has awesome seafood!! The place is small and cute, with a beach theme. They make awesome Micheladas for curing a hang over. We had a dozen oysters, which were delish! I had some fried shrimp and fish  and a shrimp ceviche tostada. It was Scrumptious!! Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be sure to visit this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had the pleasure of spending my Friendaversary with the lovely Georgie S. this past Sunday at the Opera. Because we saw \""La Boheme\"" I felt it only right to get Italian food, so we headed over to The Old Spaghetti Factory in hopes of satisfying our pasta craving.\n\nIt was quite charming when our waiter came over with the bottle of wine that we ordered. It was the second most pricey bottle they sold (coming in at $34) and he told us in the four years he worked there he had never sold a bottle that expensive. Well, that's because you don't have high class broads like us patronizing this establishment, or so it would seem!\n\nThey have a good sized menu with a lot of delicious looking dishes. I was especially excited that they have gluten-free pasta! I was hoping I would be able to eat more than a salad. On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal. \n\nThat means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!\n\nThe place itself is pretty charming. They have a trolley car in the middle you can sit in. The one drawback is that this place is very \""family\"" oriented; something Miss G and I are not normally very \""fond\"" of. But we dealt. \n\nVery solid 4 stars.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After writing this review and the comment left by Joseph I got a call from a collection agence. They are claiming that they provided services that they did not.  Stay away from this guy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A friend proposed Club Tavern for fish fry.  None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \""real\"" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \""oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\""\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\""\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Once you navigate the madness known as \""Central Ave. Construction\"" and arrive at this Kinko's you are met with the most friendly and professional staff. It is worth the travel time for ya'll I promise. Other Kinko's, to me, seem less personable. Here, Raul, Rhonda and Cameron (and the other unsung heroes) treat you like a king. Or a queen. Depending. U get it. They really know their stuff here. UB. Link. FAX...all the lingo...they are in the ringo! I've had invitations, signs and all sorts of other \""paper\"" products produced here...all the best. \""Oh Kinko's you're so fine. You're so fine you blow my mind. Oh Kinko's\"". Darn, there's a song in there somewhere! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this place! It's huge, for one, has a great selection of new and used in addition to gifts, etc. Only prob is parking, but that's not really their fault -- it's the stupid  construction that's been going on since the beginning of time. And the staff is great. Recommended. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nice place to try a different kinda of sandwich if you're tired of chains like Subway. I love their Housemade Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil : food was fresh and the bread was excellent. I also tried the Tuna with Red Onion, Gaeta Olives, Lemon & Arugula and that was nice as well.\n\nService/seating was really quick (went on a Saturday for lunch). Only complaint is the parking, had to park on the street a couple blocks down because their lot was packed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst Indian in the entire phoenix valley, the lunch buffet had only one chicken dish, one meat, one daal, one vegetable, are you kidding me and nothing was exceptional, it was just average.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I just happened to go to the Shell gas station and my son said he wanted wendy's to eat. Now we dont normally eat out often but today I said ok. We got the gas, walked in wendys and instantly I saw how filthy the restaurant was. Then I walked in further towards the cash register and there was this aweful smell. We automatically turned around and walked out the restaurant. My first time there and this was an aweful experience and I will not eat there again. They need to work on keeping the place sanitary especially being a good place.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A nice little shop, not too busy, that sells Leftza, when in stock. The Blazer I had was good, nice bread with Boar's head Buffaloed chicken.  Yes, you could make it yourself if you want to,but this is quick, no mess place, family run. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I believe I was the first Yelper to give this place a 5 star review.  I used to love this place and came here every time I came back to Charlotte from the west coast.  However, the last time I ate here back in May, something happened that ensured that I'll never come back.\n\nI ordered calabash shrimp, turnip greens, and coleslaw.  About 5 minutes into my meal, I took a bite of greens and felt something really sharp in my mouth...and pulled out an ~1 inch-long razor sharp grarled piece of metal...I'm pretty sure it was from the can lid the greens came from.  Anyway, had I swallowed it, it would have ripped me up inside.\n\nI told my waitress and the owner.  \""Oh we're so sorry.  Can I bring you something else?\""  My stomach had turned at this point so I said \""no.\""  At this point the brain-dead owner handed me the check and went to the register so I could pay!  \n\nRather than argue, I figured here's a guy that has seen me in here for over a decade.  All the waitresses know me and stop by and talk.  If he's so freaking stupid to want to charge me for a meal I didn't eat and that was contaminated with a piece of metal that could have sent me to the hospital or worse, I'll pay for the meal and let you guys know to steer clear.\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been coming here for about 11 years (off and on) because the location is convenient for me.  Quality is standard, but the prices have gone up to the point where I do not think they are competitive anymore.  Mens dress shirts are at least 20% higher than most other places.  The last time I picked up my laundry they also up-charged me for 'lined' wool slacks. In fact, I had to point out that the pants were not lined. You need to carefully review your charges before you pay  otherwise you might get ripped off.     Probably won't be returning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My mom and I have been faithful clients for over 10 years, and I don't think that will ever change! I am guilty of bringing too many pictures that try to show what I want in my next haircut, and they always go above and beyond and give me more than what I expected. I've had a pixie cut, asymmetrical bob, bangs, and highlights done, and I loved each and every change I made, thanks to them.\n\nTheir massages before they work on your hair are AMAZING. I tend to doze off, and by the time I have to get up to walk to the sinks, I miss it already! Their tea is refreshing, and the salon itself is really hip and modern. It's quintessential Downtown.\n\nI always feel pampered when I go. They know what they're doing, and they're great at it. The price is definitely worth it, because unlike most salons, the work lasts and your hair leaves healthier than it did before. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had lunch at Mandarin Wok once again today, and I left with happy stomach.  I ordered my favorite dish \""Braised Fish\"" and 3 dim sum dishes.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In July 2013, I was staying at the Country Inn down the street, and figured I'd walk to dinner in the area. I had my heart set on another restaurant.\n\nTHEN I SMELLED BARBECUE.\n\nI literally followed my nose, and ended up at Fat Jack's. I was traveling alone, and the experience was phenomenal. Good food and great staff. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but once inside, they have a ton of memorabilia around. I've been there several times since (I'm from Chicago, so I'm not up that often), but it is my go-to if I'm riding I-90 through the area.\n\nIf you're feeling ambitious and/or want leftovers the next day, go for their sampler platter. It has all their barbecue and is more than enough for 2 meals. There's two different kinds of sauces on the table, mild and spicy. \n\nI went here last Friday, 8/1/14, with my boyfriend for lunch. As we got out of our car, an older gentleman told us how good it was. And right he was!\n\nI wish Fat Jack's was nearer so we could go more often! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \n\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Booo for the worst online florist I have ever used and I've used a lot based on the deisgns they have available. I picked a great contemporary bouquet for a friend's 30th birthday (Saturday) only to be told none of the florists in the state (Indiana) had the flowers I wanted. Then was told I'd have to wait until they could source the flowers from somewhere in the state. When I said  they would be late we went with an alternative, unseen by me, contemporary design. Then I was contacted again a few hours later to say it was too late in the day in Indiana so the flowers woud have to be delivered on Monday. So in short the wrong flowers, the wrong day and they weren't remotely contemporary! They were meant to depict California more like Georgia boo boo boo!!!! $115 wasted and apparently they sent an upgrade!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! <|endoftext|>

Also the cheese fries are amazing! Enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really don't like this terminal, I use it often as a layover on the way from San Francisco to Minneapolis.\n\nIt's too hot and the domestic gates are too far which makes you always have to walk a mile to switch gates.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had this for lunch today.  I had split a Spinach salad with 5 medium wings. I'm a wing person and love good wings; however these were far from great.  They were tiny wings and the sauce was just too watery and not great.  The salad had wilted spinach.  I picked pieces to eat, but threw much of it away.\n\nI wont be back.  \n\nI gave it two stars because a co-worker liked her sandwich. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThe quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.\n\nWe will not stay at this hotel again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The 1 Star was for the Mahi tacos that was the only thing that was great about this experience. Being from San Diego I am spoiled when it comes to great Mexican food and service. First off when you order a shot Put it in a small rocks glass not a plastic cup that you make jello shooters in! Serve real salsa and guacamole Please for goodness sake! If your going to call yourself a Mexican establishment then do it right! Please hire a waitress that has a brain and isn't slow! If it wasn't for the fact it was a go away party I would have never stepped foot in a such a dirty establishment.  WORST MANGO AND STRAWBERRY MARGARITAS EVER!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty, the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.\n\nThe chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.\n\nMaybe their regulars subs are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda, it definitely won't be here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everything looked wonderful, I wish I could have tried it all.  The atmosphere is wonderful, really nice bar area! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would give negative stars if I could. I went in last weekend to purchase/look for a helmet, jacket and gloves. I spent 45 minutes in there looking at various items and trying on helmets. No one that worked there ever looked in y direction or said \""hi\"". I left and bought a jacket online and a helmet gloves, tee shirt at the helmet store on 35th ave. I can walk to cycle gear from my house and drove out of my way and spent good $$$ at a place way more deserving than cycle gear. I'm not sure because I'm a female or because I didn't come in on my bike. Either way it's inexcusable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  mediocre Thai food. nothing bad but nothing special. ordered Tom Yum soup that lacked Thai basil, Keiffer lime leaves and barely contained Ginger. it was mostly broth with few veggies. the Pad Thai was decent. the green papaya salad was bland needing more lime juice. we ordered everything medium spice and it came out with no heat. disappointing experience. we came only due to the four star rating. the cheesy 80's radio station didn't help. not sure if I'll be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Won't come back here... These people are incompetent... Over two weeks for alterations that still haven't been done.. Made me wait Despite coming before a regular.... I'll give one star because at least the lady was nice <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The bar itself is good and the servers do a great job but man do the patrons suck! I went once and some guy decided to \""make it rain\"" and started flipping out because dudes were picking up the money. If you're dumb enough to throw a pile of money in to the air you better bet your ass that us broke college kids are going to pick it up! It's also predominantly African American (or at least it was when I went) which is totally fine but some of them looked like gang members. I'm sure I'll get called racist for that but it's the honest truth. I also saw a lot of people getting upset over the dumbest stuff...like getting their shoes stepped on, while standing in the middle of the dance floor! I will say they had a great deal on drinks when I went! $1 for anything! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this La Pomponnee wayyyyy more than the peters township one. It's less cluttered and everyone is really friendly.\n\nMy stylist is Jessica and I can't say enough good things about her. I think she is one of their junior stylists but she gives a great haircut! She actually listens and she doesn't push products on you. However I loved how she styled my hair so I ended up buying everything she used because I needed products and you know I have seen a huge difference in my hair. \nShe even told me some cute ways to style my hair which is great for me cause my hair is a pain! \n\nI spent around $100 on products and for a haircut, wash, blow dry and style was $30 which is a great price! But the haircut prices vary by stylist.\n\nNow this is why they lose a star .. I got my hair highlighted here last summer and no my girl Jess didnt do them! Since it was summer I asked for partial highlights and I didn't get my haircut cause I used a groupon at another salon to get it cut. I was charged $85 for my partial highlights which I thought was a little expensive just for that! They did look great and the stylist listened to what I wanted which was great but they faded really really fast. Yes I know it was summer but I also did buy the 2 products that are supposed to help prevent that. But oh it happens.\n\nAlso Mindy is great for waxing! She is quick, friendly and makes you feel really comfortable. Her prices are great too. \n\nTry it out and ask for Mindy or Jess you won't be disappointed! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good!  The dinning room is located in the back behind the bar.  You must get the fried zucchini!  Their breading is so light yet flavorful!  The portions for the entr\u00e9es were HUGE!  Service was great, and everyone was very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very cool venue for live music, mainly because it's small and you can easily interact with the artists. There's also seating, so if you get there early enough, you can get a seat. The pricing seems like it varies depending on who performs. I got to go for free so no complaints from me. They have a bar in the back and there is plenty of parking. When I was watching rehearsal, it seemed like the artists were having trouble adapting to the sound resonating back onto the stage, but once it went live, they sounded amazing. \n\nI saw a smoking area, which I didn't go out to, but I assume is where the patio seating is. I also didn't use the bathroom so I don't know how clean it is. \n\nOne of my favorite venues from Phoenix, since I haven't found many that I like <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We've been here 2.5 years.  At first, everything was great.  Then a few staffing changes, and things started going downhill.  Then the property was purchased by Fairfield.  Things went from okay to a little worse to absolutely horrible. Since the property was bought maybe 6 months ago, the whole place has been in a STEEP decline. The buildings are filthy, and the grounds are littered with trash and pet waste.  It's actually become embarrassing to live here, to the point where we don't invite people over any more.  The apartments are not worth half what they charge for rent, in fact, we're buying a brand-new, custom-built home in a much nicer area, and our monthly payment will be about the same as what we pay for this s***hole.  Do yourself a favor and stay away. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm a longtime fan of the Harris Grill so please note that my review is specific to brunch only.  My friends and I were lucky enough to get patio seating on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. That was the highlight of brunch- friends and the patio. \n\nThe only option for brunch is to get the buffet. They were packed and couldn't keep enough food out.  The Mac and Cheese, while cheesily delicious was cold. They kept running out of plates. They never had the salmon when I went up- yet I saw it on other patrons plates.  And, insult to injury, my Bloody Mary was watered down. My friend had a Bloody Mary and the olive in it tasted like chlorine. \n\nI will give props to the guy making the omelets.  He had all the ingredients, was quick, and friendly. \n\nLike I said, I'm a big Harris Grill fan and will be back again - just not for brunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The gluten-free pizza at this place is amazing. In fact, I'd say it's the best gluten-free pizza I've had since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease seven years ago. Unfortunately, I don't live in Arizona, but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be ordering the spinach special gluten-free pizza every time I come visit family. Bonus points: Redbridge gluten-free beer for only $3 a bottle! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite TJ. I love this TJ, bcs it is larger, has a better selection,  and looks cleaner. Love the hummus and wine collection they have here . <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to say, wow how bad can you get.  Yes the building is pretty, but everything else is of the poorest quality.  The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a \""Classic\"" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entr\u00e9e which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite nail salon in Phoenix.  I can't say enough good things about them.  They are great at customer service, all of their techs do a great job, and they are less expensive than any other place I've been to in 10 years.  If they aren't busy, one tech will do your mani while another does your pedi and you are in and out of there in no time.  The owner is really nice, too.  I was even in a pinch once and they let my two year old daughter run around while a got a quick manicure.  I'm a regular. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> THIS STARBUCK'S IS AWESOME! Amazing Cstr Service! ALWAYS Super friendly, always smiling with a positive attitude! HIGHLY recommend this location in particular, as well as this location being known as the Gay Starbuck's.  :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So far...not so good. We are waiting in the lobby with 20+ other renters. We've been here 30 min, and those finally getting cars have been waiting 2hrs. I use Yelp all the time, and this was the one time i didn't check a place out before paying for a rental...huge mistake! Look at other rental locations reviews, they are much better!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.\n\nOur reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.\n\nAround 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. \n\nWe were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table \""hopping\"", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.\n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. \n\nLobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this \""hydroponically infused\"" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were \""out\"" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.\n\nThe last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they \""were out of bags\"". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years, but these greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would have cost them nothing. Where has good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe me - theres nothing special abt this hotel. The William Penn, the Doubletree, and several other hotels are FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates on Priceline. Heck - i'll even give a shout out to the Renaissance downtown -- it's not owned by the Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Absolutely the best place to get a delicious Reuben and brew fries in town! My favorite dive on the Eastside of Madison. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of the best bars in campustown.... until friday and saturday nights.\n\nMost of the time its pretty relaxed and quiet. They have decent burgers and a fair selection of beers. Its close to anything on campus, so if you need a pint to commemorate the end of a project or test - its the place to go.\n\nThat said, they make their money on all the younger students going out partying on weekends.  I head to downtown champaign for the weekends. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was craving pizza. I wanted to try somewhere local and found this place across the street from hotel. I ordered to go, and the host was bubbly and cute. I didnt know what I wanted so I decided to try the \""recommended\"" pizza skins and the numero uno deep dish. \n\nThe skins came the size of a peresonal pizza and had the deep dish crust, looking like a pizza, but it was filled with mashed potatoes and topped with bacon bits. I do not recommend. It was too starchy, and not enough flavor. I only had one piece. \n\nThe pizza was good. It was basically a combination and the personal pizza was huge. The crust became a bit much after a few pieces, but the filling was great. I think the restaurant has better options, but rating purely on food I was not impressed.  \n\nIf I were ever to go back, id keep it simple... a pepperoni thin crust. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  No Bueno on the green corn tamales and the service was terrible for lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just went there for the first time today, very nice barbers and great price! Would recommend them to everyone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I LOVE stopping by LGO in the morning for coffee on the way to work. This is a charming little place where you can pick up coffee, or a good fresh breakfast. They also have great sandwiches and salads. And did I mention gelatto?\n\nMy favorite though HAS to be the French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookies. Sweet and savoury and just a little buttery all at the same time. There's only one other thing that can make my eyes roll back in my head they're THAT good! I now pop in here and pick up a dozen for any party because everyone LOVES them. \n\nYou can also pick up a nice bottle of wine, some artisan cheese or bread and some interesting knick knacks not at all related to food. Think of it as part high end market/deli/cafe/wine shop/bakery/coffee shop/etc.\n\nThe only thing that sucks is the parking but the valet guys can usually work something out for you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very comfortable hotel. The front desk staff is always so nice. I have hosted several meetings here and the complete experience has always been favorable. From in-room dining to restaurant options you will not go hungry. \nWalking distance to many great places through out downtown Charlotte. \nI always sleep like a a baby. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think this might be the only place in the area that consistently gets my order right.  I always get take out so I can't speak to the dine-in experience.  My food is always fresh, the proper temperature, nicely packaged and correct.  This location in particular has been very pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered. I ordered the chicken Primavera. Absolutely awful! No flavor, the chicken tasted old and was breaded horribly. No crispness. Overall just an awful dish. The noodles were undercooked, Mariana was very bland. I can't get over how horrible this dish is. It's so bad I'm writing this review while eating it and the only reason I'm eating it is because I have a football game tonight and I need the carbs. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love this restaurant, and come here for every Valentine's day and our anniversary. The steaks are amazing, melt-in-your-mouth and delicious! But most of all we come here for the service; I don't think we've ever had mediocre or bad service at this location. \n\nI just learned that they're closing this one because the stupid building owners won't renew their lease, lame! We are so so sad, but hope to see some of our favorite servers at the other location (shout out to Ken and Shay!) :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The sales staff must be paid on commission here because they will not leave you alone...EVER! I think if I told them I was contagious they would still fight over who got to \""help\"" me shop. I am an independent shopper..if I want help than I will ask, but usually I just want to shop on my own. To over-priced and annoying for me to come in again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Was less than impressed when we noticed a patron sitting behind us at the bar with a snake around her neck.  When we spoke to the mgr. all he could say was he didn't know that she brought it in.  And he was doing the best he could to accommodate them with a seat on their outdoor patio.  REALLY, because they should be in your restaurant at all.  We asked him if the board of health would shut them down for this and his response was, \""She says it's not venomous.\""  They were more considerate to the attention seeker with the snake than a paying party of 12.  I followed up with a call to their corporate office and spoke with their area manager.  He plans on coaching that store manager on ways of better handling situations like this.  His empty apologies and hardly gracious $20 gift card will not be getting me back as a customer! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to give this two stars, for my nails look fabulous (besides the fact they are as sharp as cat claws)\n\n$35 for a gel FILL? $30 for a natural bail gel MANICURE? Are you serious?! Beware!!! I had a regular tell us we got RIPPED OFF. I get it is holiday season and you see $$$$$ but I see jerks who rip people off. As I said : beware!! Especially because their little price pamphlet says my fill would be max $25 and the manicure max $20. \nThere is a reason why I go to this place in chandler - $32 for new gel full set WITH MATTE POLISH!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Been to Rock bottom multiple times, just as always had a great time. Our server was Donna, great server and she knew a lot about the beers.\n\nThe manager was walking around checking in on tables so I asked him for his suggestion from the menu. He suggested the Chicken Parmesan pasta with the \""Smoky Mountain\"" pasta sauce and a side of marinara.\n\nIt. was. amazing. Perfect recommendation. Had a great time. We'll definitely be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am a new \""member\"" and let me tell you, I am not very amused. I have a VISA secured credit card with them and because of it, a savings account. I want to make a payment to my VISA secured credit card and I cannot do it online using a checking account from a different bank. The only option is to \""move money\"" from their savings account onto the secured credit card. It's 2013 people!!! How many of you cannot pay your VISA with your checking account?\nCalled their customer service, after being on hold for 31 MINUTES, I was hung up on. Called again and after on hold for another 32 MINUTES, I was hung up on again. Called the lady that opened my account, voicemail. An hour wait for a simple freaking question from a new member!!\nAfter some research online, I found out I can pay my VISA secured credit card with a debit card from a different bank, by paying a $18 \""surcharge\"" fee. How the hell am I supposed to pay them?? Go to the freaking branch in person to pay a simple credit card??\nNo answers. Left a voicemail to the lady who opened my account and hopefully she will get back to me.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter an hour wait on the phone, I finally got to talk to someone and they did tell me I cannot make an online payment using the checking account from a different bank. I can only pay it online using the debit card from a different bank and paying the $18 fee. Or I can pay using the checking account from a different bank over the phone, pay a $5 fee and it takes up to 4 days to process. Or I can go in person, give them my debit card from a different bank and be charged a non-bank atm fee by my bank. What a mess. I'm closing my account and going someplace else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great food overall at all locations! Go to another location to eat though. The Market Square location has the most horrible service I've ever experienced. Horrible! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After a meal at Moira Sushi, we decided on a whim to stop in at Jordon's for a fried ice cream dessert.  We walked in the door and the place smelled of old carpet and b.o.  Not very appetizing, but I'm willing to give any place a chance.\n\nWe ordered the dessert, it arrived promptly...and was clearly not freshly made.  A very icky mushy crust with some cinammon and a dab of whipped cream, after a few bites we both looked at each other and said \""yuck!\"".  Worst fried ice cream we've ever had!\n\nAfter seeing some of the food passing by, it's probably on par with any other chain mexican, similar to a macayos or carlos o'briens.  Crispy tacos, flaccid yellow cheese, tomato and lettuce on everything.  Surely a step up from Taco Bell, but what's the point of that?  \n\nWIth so many authentic cheap (and good) Mexican food places nearby with great corn tortillas and cotija cheese, I'll call this one a total pass....and I understand why I've never stepped foot in the door in 10 years that I've lived within 3 miles of the place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  An international hub airport with that regional airport feel.  Take from that what you will. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the 4th cedar-faire operated theme park I've been to and most definitely the worst. Here's why:\n\n- half of the rides weren't open because 'the wind'... Yeah, no, there was barely a breeze. To make matters worse, it was all of the bigger 'thrill' rides and coasters. Kind of like going to Disney but space mountain, pirates of the Caribbean, and splash mountain are down.... But don't worry, you can wait in line forever to go on its a small world! No.\n- $14.50 for chicken tenders and fries? No.\n- it's standard practice to have a car running and a car unloading/loading to cut down on the lines. This was in practice on only a handful of rides resulting in looooooonnnngggg wait times. On a Thursday.\n- apathetic staff taking their time and making the waits longer\n\nBut there were some pluses:\n- girl selling pictures outside of ricochet was very friendly as was caricature artist\n- bathrooms were clean\n- it wasn't heartbreaking to leave the park at the end of the day because leaving at 2 was the best decision of the day. Probably we got to Sonic in time for Happy Hour and got both of our meals for less than the chicken tender combo\n\nI'm glad I can check another amusement park off my list, but this is not one I'll be returning to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We tried to go here on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant was full of people who had just gotten back from church.  I am an Asian lady and was stared at by most of the people in the restaurant as if my partner had bought me on the Internet.  If you are at all sensitive to social ambience and are not white, I do not recommend this place.  I felt too uncomfortable to stay, which was just as well because nobody tried to seat us or acknowledged us in any way, so after standing around uncomfortably for a while we left.  which is too bad because I like apple dumplings. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had the country fried steak with brown gravy, roasted potatoes, and mac & cheese. The meat, gravy, and potatoes were so salty they tasted like they were being cured. I couldn't finish it. The mac and cheese was okay, but oddly a bit bland. I like their sandwiches and salads, but I don't think I will be ordering an entree again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place has some of the best chimichangas in Arizona.\n\nI love how crappy the building is because it makes the food so much better. I think pretty much everyone I have ever taken to this place got nervous about what was about to happen at first glimpse of the building.\n\nAll have left happy to know the place existed and instant fans of the food. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts\""romantic\"" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List.. <|endoftext|>

I have had bad experiences at almost ever doctor's office I've been to. When I went to Cornerstone Women's Health I was so pleased. The office staff were so nice and efficient. I got lost and showed up late but I didn't have to wait at all and they weren't rude about my late arrival. I saw Dr. Pelopida and I thought she was wonderful. She didn't act rushed and she listened to me thoroughly. She was very personable and knowledgeable. I was very pleased with the entire experience and I absolutely recommend this practice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love cheese! This place is like, I imagine, many others throughout Wisconsin. But since I went to this one and liked it, 5 stars.\n\nWe stopped here on a road trip and was happy to see it open before 10. Walking in we saw more than just a cheese house. They had specialty gifts, wine, beer and fudge amongst a haven of cheese. \n\nThe people who worked here were incredibly helpful and friendly. They were happy to give advice about what beer we would like and happily cut samples of cheese. \n\nAlthough we only left with a 6 pack of Wisconsin only beer for $9.99, I was tempted to buy much much more. It is possible we will stop on our way back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You want fresh? You want healthy? You want great sales?!  THIS is the place!  After being ripped off by the chain grocery stores, and getting inferior products, I now buy ALL my meat and fruits veggies etc. at my local Sprouts. GREAT staff, exceptional food and terrific sales; I am a FAN FOR LIFE. Thanks, Sprouts, for redefining healthy eating AND top of the line products. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Williams-Sonoma is not so great as people say it is when it comes to buying their coffee pots. \nFirst of all they really need to hire people who know about coffee pots and also make sure their coffee pots really function. \nI use to love Williams-Sonoma until we started having the worst problems after buying their coffee pots. Cusine Art Coffee pot that cost over $100 didn't work properly. We would end up with burnt tasting coffee. \nBefore that we ordered their Italian coffee maker, Bialetti \""Moka Express\"" Stove Top Espresso Maker. Later on we ended up with metallic tasting coffee and returned it to the same shop. \nSurprisingly after letting them know about the coffee pot problems a month later they still had the same coffee pots there. But on the very bottom shelf. \nWe didn't have any problems getting our money back or store credit. \nBasically don't buy their coffee pots. \nOn top of that when the employee would ask us if we had any questions they couldn't even answer any questions about coffee pots. \nOther than that all their other items are pretty functional. So far. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my 2nd time here and I thought that I attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact I was sooooo hungry. Well my 2nd time and for a Chinese Buffet, this place is fantastic. The restaurant itself is very clean. The buffet is also very clean and even though I showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. The amount of choice is less than just about all the Chinese Buffets that I have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. All the patrons here are American, so this isn't the Asian place where the Asians eat. It's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. I would certainly return. Giving it 7.5 Knuckles out of 11. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We've been raving fans of Spinato's for a few years but what happened on Valentine's day, 2014, moved our affinity for this company to a new level. My daughter is serving in the U.S. Air Force, currently stationed in Guam. It's 6,444 miles from Phoenix to Andersen Air Force Base on a tiny island the size of Scottsdale in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. She's so far away. There's a giant hole in our hearts from missing her. She knows we love Spinato's pizza, the sauce with it's sweet and savory goodness, the family friendly service and the affordable prices in a time of vast economic uncertainty. It's a little slice of comfort. So, she wanted to surprise us with a gift card to our favorite restaurant but that's a little hard to do from so far away. Spinato's stepped up in a big way. Not only did they sell her a gift card, but they sent one of their managers, with a bouquet of twelve red-heart balloons, to deliver her gift to our doorstep. Spinato's act of service for one of our military members went above and beyond the call of making great pizza. They showed their patriotic spirit by helping an airman reach out with a comfort-food hug to her parents. Thank you Spinato's! Your actions reflect selfless service to others and bring great credit on your company, the United States armed forces and pizza makers all over the world! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Padron Anniversary Series cigars. The problem is, they are REALLY expensive. Recently I read about some \""Padron Alternatives\"" online. These are cigars that are made to feel, look and taste as close to the real things as possible. Deciding to order some online I suddenly realized as I was entering the payment information that these were going to be shipping from here in the Valley. Not only that, one of their locations was right down the street from my office.\n\nSo yesterday, instead of going to lunch, I headed down to Cigar Warehouse to try a couple of these fake Padrons. Now the cigars themselves were not Padrons by any means. But they were pretty good for the price, good enough that I bought a bundle. But that's not the point of this review. \n\nThe store was not huge, but a decent size. The whole place is essentially one big walk-in humidor. Their selection is not as good as someplace like Tinder Box in Ahwatukee, but decent nonetheless. They have a lot of big brands, as well as their own \""alternatives\"" to some of the more expensive premiums which I mentioned above.\n\nThey also have a little smoking lounge with over-stuffed leather couches. That was nice. It was good to be able to have some water, enjoy my purchase, and not have to pay a large annual membership for the privilege. \n\nBut what I really enjoyed about the place was the conversation. The guy working there was pleasant to talk to, and some of the customers also joined in the conversation. One thing, maybe the only thing, I miss about living in Indiana is having a lot of people I can just talk to--conversation that goes beyond sports or cars or the weather. This place was a taste of that. \n\nI'll be back often. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is your typical Jersey Mike's sub shop and it's located smack dab in the middle of uptown.  Like most Jersey Mike's the ingredients are fresh and the subs are really good.\n\nOn Tuesday's you can get a regular sub, chips, and a drink for $5.99.  I must say that's a pretty good deal.  If you keep your receipt from Tues you can come back any day of the week and get the same deal again for $5.99.  If you're not lucky enough to get there on Tues then the subs for lunch can get a tad bit pricey.  A regular club sub, bag of chips, and drink will run about $10.  When you get into the $10 range for lunch uptown you start to have a lot of options at your dissposal.  So my advice is go on Tuesday if you can! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is a joke. The employees are slow as can be, they f*ck the portions up, they look at you like you're an idiot when you are ordering. I wouldn't give this place another shot unless someone else was paying for it. I feel this place should be shut down and a Filibertos or something of that nature should open up in its place. Hell I will just go to the Taco Bell that's in the same parking lot. \n\nThe one star is because they had air conditioning.\n\nManager should be fired. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So my iPhone went haywire this afternoon. The little 'slide to unlock' button - it wouldn't slide. Calls and texts were coming in, but I couldn't get to 'em. Now, I'm not saying I dropped it shortly before it went haywire - because that might have voided the warranty, and besides, it could have gone haywire without being dropped - but I'm not saying I didn't either, if you know what I mean. \n\nWell, since I couldn't exactly call for help, I went online and made an appointment for the genius bar. This was around 3pm, I guess. Earliest appointment was for 7:20. I showed up at 7:10, checked in, got called at 7:15. Walked out of the the store with a brand new iPhone at 7:25. A brand new iPhone in 15 minutes! So all those little nicks and scratches that have been piling up for the last year (maybe from being dropped, maybe not) - gone. That pocket lint I've been trying like hell to get out of the little speaker holes - gone.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've been to the genius bar at an Apple Store - I've had iPod and MacBook issues as well over the years - and every time, every single time, it's the same experience, whatever the store. The employees are friendly and courteous - the guy tonight - Matt, introduced himself, shook my hand, told me he'd be solving my problem tonight. And he did - quickly and efficiently. Thanks, bro. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pedro's is a place that I remember fondly from my childhood. We used to eat there from time-to-time when I was a kid.  \n\nSadly, the place hasn't seemed to evolve much since the 80's.  We went for an early dinner one night before seeing a show in Madison.  We were seated at about 4:30 pm, and were the only ones in the dining room.  The decor is 80's \""americanized Mexico.\"" It looked exactly as I remember it from years ago.  It did seemed to be kept up.\n\nI was really looking forward to the hot fresh tortillas they used to serve.  There is a tortilla maker in the middle of the dining room.  Unfortunately, the machine wasn't running.  I can understand that since the place was pretty empty, but the tortillas they gave us were dry and hard.  They had been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit disappointing.\n\nI had a burrito, it was ok.  Nothing too exciting.  In the 80's and 90's it would have been great, but Mexican food in Wisconsin has gotten so much better over the years.  \n\nI still love their chips and salsa, though!  However, that probably isn't enough to bring me back again anytime soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ever since Caf\u00e9 Royale took over the scene, the coffee is not fantastic. The baristas are always super crass and I know multiple people whom have applied for positions there and have been turned away because their lack of coffee making skills. So, rather than hiring someone new and exciting and completely qualified, they don't want to bother with teaching others coffee making skills, so they keep hiring people with huge egos and previous experience. How neat! I don't come here anymore - bad vibes. Go to The Victory a block or two down! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not sure how they got four stars. The place is cute but that's about it. It is unkept and feels dirty and old, it has a potential of being a great little cafe if they would serve good food. \nOften run out of ingredients, the sandwiches are not cheap and they don't give you much for your $. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sometimes, an establishment gets an extra star boost for being unique. As the only ice rink in Phoenix, Arcadia Ice Arena is just that kind of place. And, needless to say, in an area that is consistently warm and a goddamn inferno in several months of the year, why shouldn't I reward a place that allows me to enter frigid temperatures and relax by taking a few spins around the ice? \n\nGranted, the place is in a moderately sketchy shopping center and the arena itself is rundown, but the staff is generally nice, the ice is well maintained and the prices are affordable (even before the recent slurry of Groupons). And, yes, I did just use a ice-related word. \n\nThe best part about Arcadia Ice Arena? The fantastic bar, Ice House, featuring a ton of different local and craft beers, microwave popcorn, live music on weekend nights, darts and a great view of the rink. What a one-of-a-kind experience to have here in the Valley of the Sun! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Probably the best Thai restaurant in the valley save for Malees on Main, which is double the price. I have been to Thailand many times, and Thai Lahna represents true, authentic Thai cuisine like what you would find on the streets of Bangkok. Clean flavors, good preparation, friendly staff. \n\nThis family run restaurant is a pleasant change from the chain eateries so common in Phoenix. They have beer and wine <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had an absolutely horrible experience today at this location.  I brought in 2 reams of multicolored neon documents that I had already printed and needed to be cut into 6 panels.  I dropped off the documents around noon and was promised the cuts to be completed by 4:30.  I arrived at 4:30 to find that 30% of the panels I needed cut out were ruined.  Completely cut through the printed area because the employee had mistakenly turned the first few sheets around the wrong direction so the rest of the ream was cut beyond correction.\n\nThey offered to reprint and use their own paper and claimed it was the same multi-color neon that I had purchased at office max for $30.  It turned out all of the colors were different and their prints all came out different sizes and were cropped horrible.  When I explained to the manager that the paper color was different from what I had purchased and the cuts were terrible, she blamed my printer for being inconsistent.\n\nGuess what, all of the prints they made and cut were equally, if not worse than the ones I printed.  Bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work.\n\nThe woman who did the original cuts and made the mistake when home in the middle of the debacle and turned over the corrections to a nice young worker who was 'in training' according to his badge.\n\nHe spent the next 2.5 hours while I waited trying to reprint and recut the pages to correct the mistake but unfortunately he was not able to get the size and cuts consistent.  I ended up asking him to just print full pages and I had to buy a paper cutter and manually cut all of them so in addition to wasting about 3 hours in their store, I now had to spend another 50 dollar and spend the evening cutting them manually.\n\nManagement refused to give me the badly cut and ruin documents free of charge and instead charged me 50% of the original price.  Shame on me for even accepting this as the service from the manager was horrible and the quality of product I received was even worse.  \n\nThe ONLY redeeming part of my terrible experience was the gentleman who tried to fix the botched job.  He was patient and really cared to try and fix the pathetic job by the other employee.  He reprinted and recut and reprinted and recut, but unfortunately I just don't think he had the necessary training to really handle the job, which is obviously another reflection on management as he was basically doing most of work alone there this evening.   I hope one day this guy get promoted to management and actually cares about making customers happy.  As for the others...i think its time to find another career that is not in service oriented company.\n\n\nGo here if you don't care about quality products where employees care about delivering the products they offer instead of just giving up and going home.\n\nThanks for nothing! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Associate was indifferent to my presence the day I went in.  No greeting, no offer of assistance.  When I asked if I could look at the fan deck, she gave it to me but didn't ask if there was anything I needed help with. I had some questions about paint sheens and products, but getting this young lady to talk was like pulling teeth, and I was the only customer in the place.  \n\nThe store layout was nice, the color samples were arranged in a nice manner, but I might as well have been invisible.  I'm new to town and was quite disappointed, as a design professional I was used to working closely with BM reps in my home state and I like the product.    I went to Sherwin Williams on the way home and got excellent service.  I have switched sides. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Had my birthday dinner here with a group of 13 and it was great! Service was prompt, portion sizes are ridiculously big and the food was tasty. \n\nStarted out with the lobster mac and cheese (delish), some ordered salads and my mom ordered the sausage flatbread (delish). Soooo, the chef sent out my mom's flatbread and 5 minutes later the waitress comes back with another one, a bigger one! Compliments of the chef bc he thought the first one wasn't big enough (looked big & good to me lol). Now that's customer service. \n\nEntrees varied and all were pretty good! Hubs wasn't a big fan of the short rib entree. The potatoes that came with my trout was pretty sweet like maple. Overall,  everything else was pretty good, especially the appetizers and small plates! Great atmosphere, great food and great service! Will definitely return! Thanks for a great birthday dinner Mimosa Grill! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart?? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the my go to neighborhood nail place.  They are very reasonable, and I almost never have to wait longer than 5 minutes.  I can drop in, or when I want gel nail manis I found my favorite girl who does an amazing job.  I never get anything but french, and I like the lines not to be too thick and bulky looking.  Amazing job every time, and a gel mani with french polish is only $30, no charge for taking off the previous one.  I usually can get away with every 3 weeks, because they suggested I use clear gel polish instead of pink so when your nail grows out from the cuticle you can't see it.  I just sent my mom over and she loves her gel manicure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the most ineffectively managed company I have ever come in contact with. I cancelled my parking pass and they still accepted an accidental payment from Wage Works and refuse to refund the payment back to Wage Works/me even though I turned my pass in upon cancellation of my account and have not been parking there for two weeks. I was sent an email a month ago confirming my cancellation but when I called, I was told they \""don't do refunds.\""\nHowever, I have an email confirming they will send me a refund from when my pass would not work and the workers at the garage charged me full payment for two days ($30), which I have been waiting for for several weeks.The front desk just keeps saying \""someone in Accounts Payable will contact you.\"" I even went to their uptown office and brought my receipts hoping they would finally begin the refund process and was told to return to my office and fax the receipts. They make everything incredibly difficult and their customer service skills are extremely lacking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Husband and I were out with some friends on Saturday night and decided to hit this place up around 9pm. When we rolled in we were SHOCKED at the $5 cover charge! Who else has it so cheap???? GREAT START to our evening! :)\n\nWe easily found some nice seats on couches towards the back but the place is smallish so we had awesome views of the larger stage. It was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some AMAZING dancers blew our minds! \n\nTwo girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us ALL lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs. $7 lap dances?? sign us up!!! We all agreed, who needs Christie's $20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here! \n\nBTW-The music was just FABULOUS! Lots of variety (lil rap not much, lots of rock like Metallica, lil punk) so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcore-in more ways then one ;)\n \nGuys, girls, lesbians (we saw a few)-no matter-The Candy Store will take care of you all :D \n\nGo get your jelly watch on!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So about 10 years ago I was taken to Cajun Queen by some friends when I moved here to Charlotte from Chicago. Remembering that I was not crazy about it, I still was open to going again to re try it. I searched through all the Yelp reviews to see what to order and what was the best. \nFirst...this old House or Restaurant should be updated..obviously with the amount of people in it  at the time I left...they have the money. Stair case is wiggley..and it is just plain old..Not quaint and old ..just old.\nWe were a big party and we had a good server named IVY, but the food left lots to be desired. We were kindly treated by our hosts to almost ever single one of the appetizers to begin with. This started with Fried Oysters that were for sure fried a couple of days ago and then reheated in a microwave! ..Fried Green tomatoes were straight out of frozen bag and not fried..just barely baked..still cold in the middle..very bland. The New Orleans style Barbequed Shrimp....tiny little salad size and in the same sauce that everything including the gumbo had. \nI am going to spare you anymore..but to tell you It will for sure be another 10 years before I go back...thank goodness the company was fantastic!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why does this place still exist?\n\nBack when Sizzler went out of business sometime in the mid-90's one marketing expert explained the reasons behind it like this: \""There was no longer any question people were asking to which the answer was 'Sizzler'\"".  Soon after it lost relevance--and went through at least one bankruptcy-- the chain disappeared.\n\nCPK is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location, but besides being the only pizzeria in the Biltmore Fashion Park proper, there is very little reason to visit here. It's not the answer to any current question.\n\nThe pizza is never better than so-so. The toppings are never really that fresh. The salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that wouldn't seem extraordinary at Applebee's. In fact, i think Applebee's does salad better. The service tends to be a bit slow. The drinks are pricey.\n\nFor all this indifferent straight-from-Sysco quality, you pay a premium price.\n\nIt's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices. Maybe longer. I think they might be hurting since the departure of Planet Hollywood, which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name--though not enough to keep it in business.\n\nIf you're looking for Pizza in this part of the Camelback Corridor, hold out and go to the Parlor at 19th St. <|endoftext|>

So after multiple emails explaining all of the issues with lack of fulfillment of deliverables, horrible customer service, not contacting me for 6 weeks, etc.  The last phone call i just had was them trying to ignore ALL of the emails I sent (not joking), and started out by saying--as if I'd forget that I requested a refund 8 times--\""We have a date for you!\""  The supervisor kept telling me they have a match (which they don't because they've passed their chances of trying), and when I explained my position yet again, and their utter failure, all IJL had to say was \""Sorry we couldn't help you.\""  And they will NOT give me a refund. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pros:\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\"" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\"" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place used to be well friendlier/nicer. My mom is a licensed professional for the last 30 years. Sometime's she need's emergency supplies while at work, who better to get them but her daughter that has nothing better to do. In a way I am her assistant I have been doing this since I was able to drive so 13 yrs. I used to be able to do this for her without any problem's. The new management however left me no choice but to shop somewhere else. \n\nThe last visit was very unpleasant from the beginning and my mother was with me no less! We were not greeted or helped in any way. I asked the manager where a product was she said they got rid of it and rushed off in a hurry. We finished our shopping and went to check out, now the manager started giving my mom a hard time about not having her license. Most people have them on wall's at work, why would she carry it around w her?!?! My mother is in their system and has been for ages why give her a hard time now? The girl finally does something un-lazy and goes online to check my mom's status it took forever so yay right?! Now we're getting somewhere...wrong!! \n\nThe girl wouldn't let me pay because I am not licensed!! At this point I am mad and it takes alot to make me mad. I ended up leaving the store they did not get any money that time and we will not be returning, they dont even carry the product we went there for to begin with but were still willing to spend $ anyway. It was clear they didnt need our sale's anymore so I will be happy somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food is great, service is great, staff is great.... Chinese Food is one of my favorite cuisines, and I've tried many place locally as well as out of town... this is one of the best.  There is one other place locally that I love almost as much, but the food is there is prepared Cafeteria Style...  But very well seasoned... One Wok Food is prepared as order.. and some items could use a little more seasoning.\n\nThe Restaurant has a open kitchen, so you can see that it is clean and watch as your food is being prepare.\n\nI have never been in there when I wasn't greeted with a friendly and warm hello and a smile, no matter how busy they are..... Most of the time I call in my order and it's always ready when promised..  \n\nThe price match the quantity... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is really a 10 star review. My mom came to visit from Oregon and would probably have eaten Spinato's every night if she had the chance. Why you ask? Strangely addictive pizza. In my continuing effort to avoid moving to a wardrobe consisting entirely of pants with elastic waistbands, I usually exercise some level of self discipline when it comes to pizza. If I ate exclusively Spinato's pizza it would  be sweatpants from here on out. \n\nTry the mama's special (I think that is the name) with the marinated spinach. I know it doesn't sound great but it is amazing (throws another pair of sweatpants into the cart at Costco). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We had a sick cat and had to find a vet near our house. Shea Animal hospital was down the street so we decided to take him there. They were so nice and friendly and loved Atticus immediately. That was in November 2011.\n\n A couple days ago I noticed our cat having a hard time breathing so I called them. Dr. Organek treated him before and she called me back and also scheduled the appointment for me for the next day. Unfortunately we ended up having to put our sweet kitty to sleep but Dr. Organek spent almost 3 hours with us and talked to my husband on the phone and answered all of our questions. She was also very sympathetic. This was 4/5/12. On 4/7/12 we received a sympathy card from her. \n\nWe are very happy with their services and would bring our pets to them again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a great selection of beer for a place called a \""Draught Emporium\"".  Also the food was less than mediocre and they were out both chicken tenders and pizza when we were there.  There are a lot of much better places to get craft beer and bar food in Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst customer service ever! The manager Jason is very rude and doesn't take ownership for HIS mistakes. Screwed up our orders 2/3 times we've ordered there. Won't be giving them business again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After a fiasco with another car company, I showed up with tears in my eyes at the Enterprise counter. Maleah was so incredibly helpful and caring. The group that helped me at the actual car rental site was equally professional and you could tell that they enjoyed working with each other. Even though other car rental places might be cheaper, the level of customer service that Enterprise provides is worth the extra couple of dollars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere. Nice wine selection too. The servers are very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Plus, their bruschetta is delish! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Like any other whole foods. \n\nPrices is outrageous to a point where I rather go to AJ's fine foods. Atleast AJ's staff knows extensively what their product is and super friendly.  \n\nFor organic produce i rather go to sprouts. \n\nThanks but no thanks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  DO NOT ORDER YOUR HOLIDAY PIES AT BREADCRAFTERS!!\n\nI made that mistake last Thanksgiving!!   I ordered a pumpkin pie and an apple cranberry pie.  We had family in from North Carolina and enjoyed a loverly dinner.  Then disaster struck.  I bit into my apple cranberry piece of pie and THERE WAS CHOCOLATE IN IT!!!  A whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry.  I couldn't believe it and I was so embarrassed.  It tasted horrible.  The pumpkin pie was crappy too!!!    \n\nTo make matters worse I tried numerous times to contact the owner for a refund by phone and through their website and heard nothing then finally sent her a message through facebook!!   I heard back from her and she admitted to me they rarely check their email off the website - thats good business sense!. She asked me for my address to send the check to and gave it to her.  A couple weeks went by, received nothing so  I emailed my address again.  \n\nTo this day (June 14th) I still have not received a refund!!!  We used to lunch there once in a while but now WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!  And this year I will make my own pies!!!  Lesson Learned!!\nIt shows me that they do not care about their customers!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  \n\nMy experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  \n\nAnd patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  \n\nAfter my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'\n\nEnough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love getting our Italian On... and we think this a great gem that we never knew existed.  If you just google \""Italian restaurants in Phoenix\"" this one will always rise to the top.\n\nIt's tough to find, because there is a Mexican place in front of it.  We had to stop in the street and stare for a second to find it.  We were greeted by Vita who was also our server who gave us a great window seat.    The food was fantastic.  We opted for some of the homemade pasta options (different pastas are made fresh each day) - I had a sundried tomato pasta with a spicy red and with scallops and shrimp.  She tried the gnocchi and the tortellini stuffed with meat.   Everything was perfect.   We would definitely go again.  What's great is we were shopping at the mall and drove here, not really knowing we could walk past olive and Ivy, over the water and we would be there.  We are looking forward to our next mall visit with a darn good lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My dad is a regular here, couple times a week anyway. He loves the Seafood Sensation and not all SUBWAYS carry it.\n\nTonight we were greeted by Anthony and Tyler. Anthony even recognized my dad as a regular who is normally not here this time of day.\n\nService was great and we are on a clean outdoor patio with pop music in the background.\n\nSUBWAY is consistently good and delicious (except tonight they were out of Seafood Sensation). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A few months ago I wrote a very positive review of this place.  Starting about in September, however, something very odd and unpleasant happened to Cheuvront.  The lunch service became slow, to the point where I thought I'd been forgotten.  Worse, the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.\n\nSpecifically, I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went, a few weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today, there was four times the cheese, at least two or three times the sauce, along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.\n\nWorse, the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed, showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.\n\nI was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at Cheuvront today.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but at least the lunch service is a total loss. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Have been craving boston market a lot lately. They have stellar originator chicken. Go here once evrey couple weeks. Staff is friendly, place is clean, food is tasty. Dont know what more I could ask for? Oh wait. Bring back the sirloin tips!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I broke down and was craving McDonald's and wanted to check out the newly built one. Ordered the new bacon clubhouse burger. It was tasty but on the cooler side of hot. Once again though fries as bad as you can get. Cold, dried out and down right uneatable. I do like that they have coke zero even as it wasn't mixed properly. \nService, what service. No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line. \nDining room looks great new. Dirty as all hell. Looked to sit at 3 high tables and all the seats had greasy soda spots all over them. \nHow hard is it to manage a place like this. I've done it quiet successfully for many years. \nAnd yes someone can contact me if they'd like. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love to try new places when traveling and my wife was interested in something \""mild.\""\nFrom their menu on the web it looked like Mahoney's Restaurant had a good selection of American favorites.\n\nThe restaurant was close to our hotel so we walked over and go there about 5:30 pm on a Thursday.  It is a bar with larger dinning room, we were seated in a private booth, which was nice because they had a curtain between the booths so it was a nice secluded place to enjoy a meal... I just wish I had enjoyed the meal.\n\nMy wife and I were the only people in the bar/restaurant. We were waited on immediately and our service was good.\n\nWhile the web site is nice, their menu in the restaurant's printed menu was almost impossible to read.  I do not know know who picked the font but the number one rule when picking a font is to make it legible. I liked the fact they had descriptions with each menu item but trying to comprehend the message while reading \""through\"" the font was not fun.\n\nMy wife picked the cheese burger and fries.  I picked the fish sandwich and sweat potato fries but then changed to plan fries when I learn they put sugar on the sweet potato fries, it was nice of the server to let me know this information.\n\nFood came out quickly.  The fries were home-style with skins on and they tasted just like my homemade fries, greasy and soggy.  I love fires but I did not finish mine.\n\nMy wifes burger was cooked well done as she liked them and she was afraid it would be dry but it was not she liked it and she liked the crispy toasted bun.\n\nMy fish sandwich was in one word \""yuk.\""  I have never seen fish that thin.  It came with a tiny drop of tarter sauce in a plastic container, I asked for more when the sandwich was served and got one more drop of sauce, which might have been enough if the fish had not been so over-cooked that parts of it could not be chewed and swallowed.\n\nI had to keep picking out hard, long stands of fish from my mouth as I tried to eat the fish.  There was one long piece of fish and one about 1/2 the length of the other, the perfect amount of fish.  The breading was well flavored but the fish was so over-cooked I did not enjoy it. Our serve was nice to refill our drinks but he did not come back to ask if we need anything so I could not ask for more sauce, I used ketchup to try to finish the meal.  I know there is a balance of giving dinners privacy and service, so I do not blame the server for not coming back to ask how things were going.  He did bring the bill and process the bill quickly at the end of the meal but never did ask, \""how was everything.\""  Good thing he did not ask because I tell the truth when asked.\n\nWhen we left there was only 2 other couples in the place and I think one was related to the owners.\n\nI will not be back and if you have other choices, I think I would recommend trying them before Mahoney's Restaurant.\n\nBecause my wife enjoyed her burger I can not give them one star but if you get a burger skip the fries and go for some other side.  Their prices are very affordable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What a sad torta, I'm not Mexican but I go to Mexico once a month and I live in LA, I had to try the Mexican food while in town... What a horrible salsa, the torta bread is not torta bread, the meat was not Milanesa and they put about two cups of iceberg lettuce <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I loved baked goods! Let's just start with that. This place satifys the craving every time. The basic white cupcake with white buttercream frosting is my favorite. Actually all of the cupcakes are delish. The brownies are great, the pastrys are yummy. I will say the cookies are a little dry but nothing a glass of milk can't fix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I usually go to Biagio nails but they were booked so I decided to give Wendy's nails a try. I will never go back. It was night and day between the two places. My nails tech was continually trying to up sell me without telling me the price of anything. I am all about paying extra for a good experience however this was not. I asked for the sugar scrub and calluse remover. After she busted out this weeks newspaper to put under my feet...??? She went and got this cucumber lotion and was making a big deal about how good it smelled. Anyways she gave my my pedicure when I went to pay they said they only accepted cash tips. I ran to walgreens next door to get some cash. When I returned to give the nail tech my tip the man at the front desk told me he needed to charge me $10 on my card. When I asked why my nail tech came over and said it was because I got the calluse remover and the cucumber lotion...I agreed that I got the calluse remover and agreed to pay the as advertised price of $5 more however i explained I asked for the sugar scrub and did not receive that. All she kept talking about was the cucumber lotion. I told\nher I didn't ask for the cucumber lotion she went and got that and I would have been fine with the lotion that was included. Again she never said the cucumber lotion was extra and I didn't receive the sugar scrub like I asked. I felt like she was just trying to get more money out of me and was not being honest. The massage was short and not relaxing. I will never return to Wendy's nails again. Next time I will wait until I can get into Biagio! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent spot in great area! The Food was very good and the prices were moderate. Service was good as well. Try to Fried Chicken Breast entree, delicious. Hanger Steak left a little to be desired though, but overall good choice. I would recommend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wouldn't usually write a review on an airport, but when I do it's because it really sucks. This airport was probably last updated the same year an American stepped foot on the moon. The aesthetics are an awful addition to the awful modern commercial flying experience. The bathrooms are super outdated and small. Also, instead of paying workers to keep the bathrooms clean once per hour or so, they have chosen to put in bathroom attendants that you would find at a cheap stripclup. These awkward attendants hover over you hoping for tips because they have mints, listerine and a paper towel ready after you wash your hands. If you're comparing it to any other modern airport it is substandard. As a major traveling hub for some airlines, this place needs a MAJOR RENNOVATION, FAST! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> With the colder weather picking up in the Pittsburgh area - it's easy to get dry wind-chapped skin and to just want to stay indoors.\n\nLa Pomponee not only will nourish your skin with lovely all natural products and a soft touch - but they'll have you looking so radiant that you'll be aching to take your glowing cheeks out.\n\nI came here with my mom when we were visiting my brother and all of their staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.\n\nThey provided lush robes, a private locker for our stuff, and even gave us new flip-flops. My facialist was so lovely and warm and she massaged love and kindness into my skin using Aveda's magical all natural products. She even did some hand and feet massaging as well. So blissful!\n\nMy facial had no extractions or un-natural chemicals applied to it. It was all about nourishing the skin. It's reassuring to know that you're going to walk into a facial and come out with soft supple skin - rather than a face full of red marks and peeling. I would definitely come to La Pomponee again - for a relaxing day full of epic massage and good vibes.\n\nIf you're looking for more vigorous facial and want more pronounced results - you may want to look elsewhere. For simple natural glowing skin though - La Pomponee is the way to go.\n\nTrust. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stayed here this week for three nights.  The front desk was always very helpful in answering my questions.  I needed to extend my stay an additional night and had no problems doing so.  \n\nThe hotel is a bit dated but is very clean.  The two room suites are very nice and the bathroom was gigantic.  There was plenty of space to do work, sleep, and not get cabin fever.  The bar had good beer selections and a great happy hour.  The bartenders were very friendly without being meddlesome and even remembered my drink the second night. \n\nThe hotel was within easy walking distance of a few places, including an Asian fusion restaurant, a breakfast place (The Good Egg), a Starbucks, and a Jamba Juice. The hotel is located near a light rail stop, and the hotel will drive you anywhere within a two mile radius that you need to go to.\n\nA few downsides: The restaurant food is mediocre at best, there is no outdoor pool, and wi-fi is not free. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stop by this AM for coffee and sandwich. The food is little better but still need help on the presentation side and when you state on the menu \""egg your way\"" I should be able to order it my way. After it cost $ 9.00 for sandwich which is high.\n\nService could of been better and prices lower. Save yourself the money and go across the street and save $ 4.00 on the same items. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Headed in today to check out their new efforts on bulking up the anime and manga collection.\n\nStaff was awesome and helpful. They are still rebuilding their anime goods and manga collection now that they have 50,000 square feet of space to fill. \n\nManga seems to be hand-vetted and carefully selected, in addition to varied. Full Death Note series, Bleach, Naruto, and Scott Pilgrim box set shared the shelf in harmony. \n\nHave never read a comic book in my life, but have purchased several things from here: \n\n1. Giant Stuffed T-Rex (Squishables, 39.99 each)\n2. Japanese Candy\n3. Japanese knick knacks and assorted kawaii-ware. \n\nComics are obviously their bread and butter, but stop in and check out their cool selection of non-comic related purses, stuffed animals, pens, pencils, candy, t-shirts, and used video games. \n\nYou definitely don't have to be into comics to enjoy the place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Rating Mimosa Grill is an interesting balance for me.  The balance is between lunch and dinner.  This review will be for all my lunch experiences which have generally been pretty good so, 4 Stars.  Honestly though, if I were reviewing the dinner experiences, it would be a solid 3 and I expect more from a place like this than A-OK.\n\nOn to lunch...  There is a good mix of appetizers, sandwiches, salads and entrees from which to choose.  There are also daily specials.  The only one I can ever remember is the Friday Fish and Chips because it's always the special I want and it's never Friday when I'm there!  \n\nI mostly land on the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.  The greens are always fresh and the shrimp are plump, firm and seasoned/grilled well.  Monday's Caesar dressing was just a wee bit flat but that was the first time ever so, forgiven.  Also opted for the Tomato Bisque yesterday.  It was quite good.  Nice balanced flavors, hot, creamy, delicious!  When I have strayed to a burger or something else more substantial, I always walk away satisfied as well although, it's not a cheap lunch by any stretch.\n\nNot sure I will ever give them a chance to up the 3 Star dinner lens with which I view them.  Too many other, more consistent, options in the price range and vicinity. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Overall an excellent experience. Service is excellent Evan though she never brought me my lemon for my water. When paying over 200 for dinner for 2 I would like my lemon please. Guess I am picky. The steaks were phenomenal but again she reversed our temperature of cooking mine was the way my guest wanted his and his was the way I wanted mine. But still quality meat so no complaints. They do push to pad the bill but I knew it and accepted so shame on me. Will definitely return soon and maybe be a little more assertive. Also did not have my regular waiter so hopefully will get him back. It is a keeper! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Would love to comment on the food, but did not get any.\n\nHad a meeting in adjacent building and along with about 10 others chose Zoom for lunch. There were a couple other customers there, but nothing resembling a rush. Ordering and paying where as expected, but then the wait began.  After a considerable wait I inquired about when my salad and a couple of the other folks' sandwiches may be ready, was assured it would be right out.  A while later the sandwiches were, salad was still being made, but was reassured it would be right out. After waiting half an hour I requested a refund. They wanted me to wait \""just a minute\"" yet it was obvious they had not started the salad while the meeting was starting. They did refund my money.\n\nThey were not busy. In our time there perhaps there were 20 patrons, including us. Upon returning to the meeting the residents informed us it was not where they would have gone, obviously explaining  the absence of customers. There are good restaurants and fast food within walking distance.\nThe soda (self serve) was nothing to write about. The employees were pleasant - yet ultimately ineffective. If you have nothing to do and all day to do it this could be your place. Just don't go there to eat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They are lucky leaving 0 stars is not an option. This place ruined my DRY cleaning. I need to emphasize DRY because they washed the items i brought to them.. not only did they wash my items.. which are now color stained and washed out in areas.. they also creased (pic attached) items that clearly have a NO CREASE tag... with sooooooo much starch the pant legs were literally glued together. I have never had my things ruined or had such a piss poor job done on my dry cleaning before. Im a little shocked still.. when people drop things off and entrust a business with their personal items, to do a job that is ... oh i dont know... on the huge neon sign above their door!!! I believe i should be able to trust them to properly do the things theyre advertising for... .... ffs.   If you value your clothes... go somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would write a \""0\"" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \""Unblurred\"" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \""reserved\"" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. \n\nWhether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not? \n\nWith the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So, random Monday off and we wanted to try somewhere new.  We saw that Rokerij had 1/2 off wine on Mondays....perfect.  We have had bad luck with new places lately so when we walked in and the place was so dark it looked like a basement, we got nervous.  Only negative about our entire experience is that we wanted to sit on the patio, and we couldn't bc technically the patio is only for their sister restaurant 'Richardsons'.  \n\nAfter our initial reservations, our experience quickly became one of our favs.  We ordered from the small plates, 3 apps for $25.  Everything was seriously amazing.  We did order a 4th app which again didn't disappoint.  Service was amazing.  Our server was really passionate about the food, saying he himself only got a job after eating here and loving it so much.  He also pointed out that happy hour at the bar includes every app for $5 and wine for $5....seriously?!  These apps are not your standard bar apps.  They include, salmon, oysters and more.  Seriously so good.  \n\nThis will be our new hang out.  So glad we found this new amazing place.  It's definitely a must. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Today I happened to stop by at this Old Navy location looking to purchase last clothes and shoes for my little sisters who are going away for summer break abroad with their father.   After deciding what shoes I was happy with I remembered I did not recall my sisters shoe size.  As I searched for my phone I realized I had forgotten it at home. ( oh bummer ) I politely asked to use store phone and was declined the service.   \""But I drove here from a fair distance can I just use it to call and verify the shoe size of the six year old and ten year old\"".  \""Can you just make a guess and if they don't fit, you can come back tomorrow\"" I was very very upset with the level Of and Lack of Service . <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails, not to mention they could handle a full bar in stride....I went there last week and this place is just awful now in comparison.  I am sorry Merc, your service was poor and slow, with a kind of haughty, supercilious demeanor.  Not sure I will be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really liked this place!!!! A group of us were headed out to dinner on a Sunday for my Birthday in September and figured we head down town...Well nothing was open!!!! No Portland's, not Lisa G's, not Pasta Bar nothing...so after an hour (literally) we settled at this place...now we had no idea what to expect, but here it is a nut shell...The food was great, the service absolutely amazing, our server made some really thoughtful suggestions...The wine and beer selection were totally unique, try the pumpkin ale they had on tap...Their cheese selection was large and all the right regions (France/Italy/Spain) were represented...and your server will no doubt help you out making a selection. The desserts were actually out of this world...The pumpkin bread pudding was literally sinful! It's a must, but I have a strange feeling their desserts change regularly.. Anyway point is that place is really chill and its got a nice \""down town\"" vibe...Cheuvront and Kazmirez are worlds apart in food, crowd, and service...I don't really like to compare them....actually the only thing they have in common is that they both sell wine and cheese....\n\nOh, and they offer 25% off of Bottles to resturant industry workers!! Way to be!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  booked through a third party site and they tried to stick us in a queen room even though they had plenty of kings available. definitely gave attitude about it but \""upgraded\"" anyway. he wanted to charge me the difference but I refused. just bad service overall. no one to help with bags morning or night. even the day front desk person was short with us and rude.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you need a place for a company get together, this is it!  I was able to visit The Morehead Inn for a small company meeting of around 20 people and it was nice and cozy in the room they provided us with.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I noticed how it the plants were well kept and there wasn't that much parking.  If you come here, I would highly recommend carpooling.  From the parking lot, I was able to walk right to the conference room they had for us.  As soon as I walked in, I felt like I went back in time.  The decorations there were beautiful and made me feel like I had to drink tea with my pinky out.  The only gripe I have about their decorations was that they had plates with Slytherin colors.  How can they support the evil house in Harry Potter!?!?!  Other than that, everything was perfect.\n\nThey do not have that many bathrooms, but it is understandable since it is an old house.  I wouldn't want them to change that anyways.  I wasn't able to explore more in the Inn, but all the things I was able to see I loved.  The staff was also very friendly, so kudos to that! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great atmosphere and location, but the food is sad, just sad. Won't be coming back. It's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water, but don't come hungry. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The rest room attendants greet you and ensure that you pick up on their large \""tip\"" jars placed by the hand basins - a nice little earner, but one I'm not used to seeing so much in other airports.\nA large unpleasant security girl confiscated my security sealed bottle of gin, without an explanation apart from saying \""it ain't right\"" - remarkable since it was purchased in Manchester airport, sealed in a security bag there, and totally intact. Maybe that's another staff perk?\nRocking chairs a free Wi-Fi are good touches and lots of choices to eat at. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I dropped off my shirts and was told that they would be 1.85 which is comparable to the other cleaners.  When I picked up they had changed me 3.75 for one shirt.  Management didn't care, so I will be going elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Review 2/5/12\nWe were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.  \n\nThey have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:\n\n1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  \n\n10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> On a recent trip to Charlotte, I was reminded of one of my favorite grocery stores in the South: Harris Teeter.  \n\nThere's one on almost every corner - it's crazy!  But HT in Ballantyne came in handy  - we made several trips to this location during out five day visit.  Here's what we purchased:\n\n-Produce: It's plentiful and beautiful... not a bad apple in the bunch we brought home, and sweet strawberries, fresh asparagus, ripe mango, lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, and more...\n\n-Dairy: feta cheese and milk \n\n-Protein: Hebrew National Salami and a huge pack of skinless, boneless, chicken breasts \n\n-Herbs and Spices: nutmeg, ginger, garlic, and more... \n\n-Frozen fun stuff: pie crusts and ice cream - we found the flavors and brands we were looking for\n\n-Packaged goods: cereal, pancake mix, tortilla chips, canned tomato, pepperoncini peppers, and I'm sure a handful of other things I'm forgetting at the moment.\n\nBottom line: Harris Teeter is a pleasure to shop at no matter what you're \""in the market\"" for - quite literally!  Happy shopping! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Came here to treat the misses.\nLobster bisque was delicious. I would have a gallon of it.\nMy entree was the chefs special, which was filet mignon and lobster tail, it twas delicious. my wife had the chicken which she did not like.\nthe service was first class and prompt.\nThe View from our table was awesome, you can see the whole valley from up there.\nGood place for a romantic date with your girl. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This would be the perfect site for the TV shows \""Bar Rescue\"" or \""Kitchen Nightmares.\""\nThe biggest weakness was the waitress we had. Slow service for both the drinks and our food. This is a bar: the drinks should have come fast and furious. The food arrived before the plates. The waitress forgot my water. Waitress never checked to see if I wanted another drink.\nPlaces like this should be using mystery shoppers to test and improve their service. And this bar is in Madison, WI, where there are a million other bars one can go to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not being a really big cigar guy, I do however enjoy one with a stiff drink every now and again.  I had the chance to try this place out and I have to say I was instantly impressed.  \n\nI think it was the decor really that did me in.  Leather chairs, sofas and love seats.  Comfortable bar stools and warm wood accents and tables.  Perfect interior for a nice relaxing time.  \n\nIn terms of food, drinks and cigars I would rank it as acceptable.  I wasn't really there long enough for food so I'll have to chime in on that at another time I suppose.  I do hope to come back some time soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Outstanding knowledge of cruisers, mountain and road bikes.  I have been to all of the other bike shops in town and Joe and his crew are the most knowledgable.  If they don't have what you need they will order it.  And they will even send you to their competitors if you are desperate for parts. Great selection of cruisers and an improving selection of road bikes.  They now carry a great selection of Cannondale  road bikes.  Looking for baskets and cruiser saddles, look no further.  The only drawback is a lack of more items for road bikes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love dive bars. But dive bars should have dive bar prices, not $5 for a Corona. And please, when I ask for water don't tell me \""we only have bottled water\"" and charge me $2. Not true and not cool. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have to give this place 5 stars!!! I went today to get my oil changed after work around 430.  I had never been to this location and I left happy.  I pulled up and the young guy working was so helpful and kind.  They took my car and were done in 5-10 minutes.  I literally went inside to pay (20 dollars by the way) cheapest oil change I have paid.  I walked inside to the cashier, where there is a kids playground inside(who knew) The two people working were smiling and seemed to be super happy (even if they were working on a Saturday)  The man gave me a receipt and said now that you have this you can come in next time and get a free car wash and also today you get free popcorn.  I laughed and was surprised by the popcorn machine near the entrance (fresh popcorn).  I left after spending twenty bucks with popcorn, a free car wash and an oil change under 10 minutes.  I will be back :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here with my girlfriends on a weekday at lunch time, and we were seated right away. The wine recommendations were excellent, and the food was great. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella as an entree, and it was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of food from salads to sandwiches, and we were all impressed. Great experience! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I played this course for the first time on Saturday, December 6th 2014. Here's what I have to say: These were the slowest greens I have ever played in my entire life. They were terrible! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I enjoy Italian food a lot, I've worked as a cook in a tuscan restaurant, and I happen to be Italian; therefore, I love Penn Mac Co..  I cannot find everything I need to cook a quality meal at any other single store.  Whether I'm making sauce from stewed tomatoes, perciatelli with anchovy, or salt-cod; this store never lets me down.  And despite the enormous traffic, the place is always clean and well stocked.  Any pasta shape you can think of can be found here dried and most you can find anywhere else can be found here fresh.  The fresh cheeses look great as do the olives, though to be honest I haven't bought any yet.  Well worth a visit while shopping the strip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cooked <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My grand parents came here back when it was called \""lazy Lew's\"" back in the 50's. The place is a total dive but it's fitting and its in an industrial part of phoenix. However the food is great and so is their home made hot sauce <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I (finally) tried Comedor Guadalajara with a friend in from out of town last weekend. I was surprised by how busy they were on a Sunday at lunch time- there were people crowded in front of the restaurant and they announced names over an intercom. Whoa. We were seated fairly quickly in the (extremely large) dining room and service was efficient from that point on. The chips and salsa were more like chips and hot sauce, but they tasted good... I love the spiciness of the sauce and put it on everything. When it came to ordering, we were a little disappointed. My friend is a vegetarian and thought Mexican food would be no problem, but our waitress didn't know of almost anything on the menu that was vegetarian (most items have lard). He ended up getting cheese enchiladas and thought they were pretty 'meh.' Here's the real kicker though, I got the chicken burrito, which was absolutely delicious.... the chicken was juicy and cooked well... but the burrito mainly consisted of fantastic and flavorful grilled veggies...the type that would be perfect for a vegetarian perhaps.... hmmm. Anyway, other than that mishap, I really enjoyed my burrito and would go back to get it again. \n\n\nPS prices were reasonable, especially at lunch, and the portions were large. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I always say you cant judge spanish food by a bean and cheese burrito but man their footlong bean and cheese is da bomb! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place. I usually go a couple times a month. I've been to another location of theirs in Chandler, but mostly I end up going to the one on Central. \n\nThe pulled-pork sandwich hits the spot and the sauce they have just makes it. It has just enough spice to give it a little bite that I think BBQ needs to have. Every chance I get, I bring out of towners to experience it and they love it. With the exception of Southerners, they are incredibly insane when it comes to BBQ it seems. :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I like Dr. Padrez., he's awesome.  The staff most times are just rude.  Everytime I would take my daughter for a check up,  she would have to see another dr. Because he was always booked. My daughters 16 months and she's seen her dr. Only about 3 times out of the 10 she's been to the drs. Not to mention everytime they have another dr look at her it was another 76 patient establishment charge I had to pay.  That was ridiculous.  When I called in to ask if I should bring my daughter in asap, they said a nurse practitioner will call me right back. ... It took her 2 hours to call back.  By then I had taken her to the hospital for a spiked fever and a stomach bug.   It happened more then once.  I switched drs and am very happy with where she's at now. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Decided to stop in on a recent Friday to try the fish fry based on reviews. Worried that would be waiting for a table, we went in hopeful. Got a booth right away for four and it was very busy. I had been in here pre-Sandlot days and wasn't impressed but this \""make-over\"" is proving positive.\n\nKey points:\n - waitress was great, offered tastes of beer to help my decision\n - perch and cod, both good and plenty of it\n - pub fries were great, not overcooked like so may places\n - echoing other compliments on the beer selection, nice\n - fine for the kids too, at least earlier around dinner time (5-7)\n\nI'd come back to try non-fish fry some night. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been wanting LASIK for years and this place was really close to where I live, so I checked them out first.  Long story short, they told me I was not a candidate for LASIK because of my high prescription.  Normally they'd recommend ICLs (implantable contact lenses) but the anterior chamber of my eyes were too shallow.  So they said there was nothing they could do for me and told me I was better off in contacts/glasses.  I was pretty discouraged until an optometrist friend of mine recommended getting several other opinions (she worked for a LASIK center that did eyes worse than mine) ... and I did.\n\nHere's where I learned the truth of BDPEC... apparently within the local ophthalmologist community, they are FAMOUS for pushing ICLs.  So let me save you some time here.  If your near-sighted prescription is worse than -6.00, they will recommend ICLs (below that they will do LASIK).  FYI - ICLs cost a lot more than LASIK, too (ka-ching!).  Anyways, if you don't fit that ICL bucket, they'd rather let you walk.  After doing more research, I discovered that a high-prescription ALONE does not a bad LASIK patient make, which is what BDPEC led me to believe.  In fact, the other doctors told me that because my corneas are way above average in thickness, my risk for complications is much lower!  Imagine that!  \n\nI'm sure that if you fit into the BDPEC business model, you will get great results.  However, I STRONGLY encourage anyone considering refractive correction surgery to do your research and get at least 2 or 3 opinions outside of BDPEC.  They operate on a business-first model vs. clinical-first.\n\nGood luck! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \n\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There was time in my life that I was at Keegan's at least once or twice a week (don't judge me!) and here's the scoop on what you should order:\n\nSliders and a Stella. They have prime rib sliders, with a zesty horse radish Dijon mix that's outstanding.\n\nLook at the menu board, but Thursday nights should be Yankee Pot Roast night. \n\nPotato Skins. Big plate and good enough to share. <|endoftext|>

The staff is always nice and the two room suites are very comfortable. Free parking aaannnnndddd complimentary yummy cooked-to-order breaksfast (which is always the highlight of my stay at any Embassy Suites).\n\nOh! and there is also the manager's reception between 5 and 7 pm, if you happened to be at the hotel around those times. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm on a Madison grocery store reviewing rage! \n\nMetcalfe's is pretty much Wisconsin's own version of Whole Foods. It has the same brightly lit displays and wide open layout. I think the prices are comparable as well.\n\nMetcalfe's carries all the local goodies (Potter's crackers, Mad Urban Bees honey, etc.) that Copps and Woodmans don't carry. Some items are a little more expensive than other places, but considering the convenience, I don't mind paying a couple cents extra to pick something up at Metcalfe's. \n\nI was looking to pick up some side dishes for a picnic, and decided to stop by the deli to peruse their prepared dishes. I ended up going with the signature potato salad, which a hit at the picnic! I'd say that Metcalfe's would be the place to stop after work to pick up groceries if you are too lazy or too tired to cook for the night because you could always make a pit-stop by the deli/hot foods/salad bar before exiting! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  much overdue review, but...\n\ni guess it doesn't matter what was ordered here, because somebody has a heavy hand as far as salty condiments are concerned, so dishes are peculiarly salty, and it is possible that while en route to our table, someone surreptitiously powdered the food with yes, even more salt. flavor isn't necessarily bad, but if you didn't know, i prefer a blend of flavor(s), not just a flavor (salty). \n\nif you are luckily having salticious cravings, and would like to experience edema and other related salt and water retention, this is a great place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Maybe I am missing what the big draw to Joe's is but I feel like C-U and Campustown have better bars around town. Being a grad student, I think the appeal is usually lost. The only plus is that they have my favorite cider (Strongbow) on tap. The service is okay and I am glad that they at least have their own beer. Their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay. Given the choice, I would choose other bars over Joe's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was driving down the road when I felt the bumpity bumpity of my, yep dammit, flat tire. Of course my tears started flowing, I was about to have to either attempt to put my spare on, act desperate on the side of the road for someone else to do it, call a super expensive tow truck (because I didn't even know if i had a spare) or...drive on it until I saw a tire place. I figured that was a no-no (and as I was crying on the phone to my husband he was telling me that I would ruin the whole wheel) but i kept going and kept my fingers crossed, while firmly at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel of course. Then, just a few feet down the road, lalalala I see a pep boys sign like a mirage in the desert. I never realized pep boys fixed flat tires but I figured it was worth a shot and was super happy that they did! I pulled right in and there was a small wait (probably a good thing...I may have been nervous if they had no customers) but the wait was fine and I had Facebook timelines to stalk. The manager (I assume he was the manager at least?) was super nice and assured me that I didn't break my car. They were fast, affordable and most importantly, not condescending or sneaky (which I feel like I get a lot from other places). Plus they were nice and they were THeRe!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.\n\nWe ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.\nPancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.\n\nBah. Cook/waiter was funny, so points for that.\n\nAgain, the only good thing was that it was open when I wanted food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went there with a couple female friends late night for reverse happy hour and the male bartender was rude and made derogatory remark towards my female friends. When I called the manager over she was sympathetic but I will never go there again <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm a big fan of the Mint Museum of Craft + Design. Their exhibits always feature beautiful works. I really liked \""Possibilities: Rising Stars of Contemporary Craft in North Carolina\"" in the summer. Like Mindy W., I particularly liked the work of Anne Lemanski. Her art involves three-D constructions of animals using politically charged images. Right now, there is also an avant-garde jewelry exhibition at the museum.\n\nIf you're new in town, appreciate art and are looking to meet people, I'd recommend checking out the Young Affiliates of the Mint. It's a social group for young Mint supporters. They have fun parties and monthly happy hours on the roof of the Mint. It's a great venue because you're in the middle of Uptown's skylines and have a really unique view of the city. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A great place all around whether you are looking to donate or buy something.   If you are looking for an old door, tile or quirky part for a home project this is the place to go.  I recently bought a new vanity and was able to donate the cabinet portion (do check the website for specific requirements on donations). They make it easy as you back your car up to the large warehouse doors and a helpful worker will unload. Don't forget your receipt for tax time!  I  live 4 blocks away and often go to drop off recycling another great benefit of this place.  They have large bins for many different recycling options from card board boxes to plastic. \n\nAlso  this place is nonprofit and they have an amazing fundraiser every year in September called the Big Pour.  $75 ticket gets you all the beer and food you could want for 3 hours.  Best event in Pittsburgh! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am from San Diego and have spent my fair share of time eating my way down the Baja peninsula. Having said that, this is the best Mariscos I have had since moving to Arizona. Very authentic. How can you beat awesome Mexican paella for 14 bucks? The bacon wrapped shrimp were to die for. Large, plump, juicy shrimp wrapped with crispy bacon. Six of them plus rice and beans for 13 dollars is a very good deal.\n\nThe service was great. Three of us ate till we burst for about 50 bucks. I would give five stars but the location is remote and near the airport so not a great area. Still, we will definitely be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When I first got my puppy she was matted and had a string tied around her tail (whoever had her before had tried to crop it at home, I rescued her). Crystal has taken extra special care of my little girl from day one! My dog loves going to her, she gets so excited to see her. My pup always looks adorable when she comes back home! I always get very detailed report cards from Crystal, which means she's paying attention to my pup's needs. I discuss what's going on with my dog before the groom and Crystal makes awesome suggestions regarding whatever needs my dog has (i.e.. more conditioning in the winter, shorter cut in the summer, even which type of glucose she suggests). I send all my friends with animals to her, and now I'm doing the same with you! Hope your pets are happy and shiny! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Finally some recent reviews that I actually agree with.  This place is low rung and it makes my own BBQ look amazing!  \n\nFYI ya'll the online order site does NOT WORK but it sure seems like it does.  That is until you get there and they sort of laugh about it not working....yeah, funny guys.  At least we didn't place the order for delivery!\n\nThe sauce is just OK and the pulled pork is tasty but good Lord, what is going on with the slaw?  It tasted as if they made it with Crisco, no flavor but notably fattening.  The corn on the cob was a hot mushy mess and what happened to the white bread?  \n\nI have lived in the South so I'd like to think that I know good BBQ and this ain't it.\n\nI agree with Jane E. this place was pretty decent a few years back but now it's just a sweet potato fry away from disaster. <|endoftext|>

I have to say, as a former resident of the Charlotte area, and after experiencing the ease of my home airport (Dallas-Fort Worth Int'l), this airport could be so much better.\n\nIt seems that CLT just keeps building on to itself and is making itself bigger and stretched so far that it is now a chore to have a connecting flight there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was referred to this practice by a colleague of mine. I was very excited to find a \""one stop shop\"" family practice where lab and x-ray's can be done in the office, to avoid the troubles of having to go to a lab and wait for the results, then go back into the office. \n\nDr. Sobel is a very personal man. I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.  Although I had a scheduled appointment, I waited in the lobby for about 30 plus mins before being walked back, only to wait another 15-20 mins before Dr. Larry would see me. \n\nAt first I thought it was just an anomaly. However, it was like that every visit, and the office staff was not forthcoming about running behind schedule, and very unapologetic. \n\nYesterday's experience took me over the edge. My appt was at 3:40p.m., I did not get called back into the office until after 4:45p.m. LITERALLY! I had checked in with \""Jessica\"" a couple of times to inquire as to why it was taking so long, she said my \""chart was up there and will be called in order\"", stating, \""this is Dr. Larry\"".  However, I noted some people were called in earlier than I that came in later. I was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 p.m. before coming out and asking what the deal was. I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, \""It's Dr. Sobel\"". \""He spends a lot of time with his patient's\"". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. \n\nThis kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...\""You can leave if you want\"". I left and will not be back again.\n\nThe courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Weird...\n\nI expected this to be a Japanese restaurant and had been wanting to try it. I've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles. So I walked in and BAM! Italian decor? WTH was going on.\n\nThis restaurant has zero sense of identity, but decent food.\n\nThey don't really know what a vegetarian is, in spite of actually having some decent adaptable vegetarian entrees. We asked our waitress and she said, \""WELL WE HAVE SALADS!\"" -_- \n\nThey need to educate the staff on the menu for situations like these, whether the person is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. So, I managed to work with Miss Clueless, and customized the pad thai - it was delicious! \n\nHonestly, I probably won't be going back. I could definitely find better Thai dishes, and can buy many of the noodles myself. It wasn't bad, just wasn't special. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love Indian food, and this place used to be my favorite.  But starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill. We tried it again recently and sadly I won't try again for quite a while. The pakoras lacked flavor, like something microwaved. The entrees were very disappointing -- Chicken Palak was the worst I've had anywhere. Bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite. Hopefully the food returns to its prior quality someday soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It is what it is, DON'T JUDGE ME.\n\nI just moved to Central Phoenix and one of the first things I looked for was the nearest Del Taco (which I admit is pretty pathetic considering all of the great food options near my house). I used to live in Tempe and there was a location at University and Rural that I used to frequent on late nights for the longest time. Sadly, it's been closed and replaced by some random chicken place.\n\nWent here twice the past weekend. Love those veggie burritos with the red sauce! I also tried some nachos-wouldn't really recommend it. Super fast & cheap, great for a quick lunch or dinner-which is exactly the point. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The ribs were the best I have ever had. The BBQ sauce is probably the best I have had. And everything is very smokey flavored, which, for me, is a very good thing. I had a chance to also try the chicken (awesome) and brisket (decent, but not amazing). \n\nFor the sides, I got corn and the French fries. This was surprising for me but the fries were average and the corn was unbelievable. I pretty much assume corn is corn, but not here. \n\nFinally, I liked the style of the place. It is a hole in the wall without man tables. I like that and recommend everyone to head there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not one to write reviews unless really compelled.  This gym is impressive; it ranks up there with some of the pricier gyms (equinox and NYSC) I have been a member of. I find myself getting bored with class offerings after taking them for prolonged periods bc the instructors get lazy--same music, same routine...blah blah blah.  I did my research before joining. I looked at Charlotte Athletic Club, Gold's and a few boxing spots. I use the gym for group classes and this place offers quite a bit. The classes offered run will into the evening (8pm), a must for those who have to run errands after work.  and the class instructors are great--they keep things interesting with new routines and music from week to week. The website is up to date with classes and instructors. The price is great for what you get --19 locations locally!\n\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating. They speak to you when you arrive/depart. They pick up the phone when you call and they have answers to questions! I mean, that alone is amazing. One of my cleats from my cycle shoe got stuck in the bike yesterday. The instructor took my info on what appeared to be scratch paper and said he would pass along my info. Sure, I thought.  I called this morning to follow up and the lady who answered the phone knew exactly what I was talking about, before I even got the full sentence out! \n\nI know folks have mentioned the parking; I have not had an issue. There are a few other parking lots they might not know about, and if you time your arrival you can find people leaving. Not bad. It does get crowded during peak hours but that is to be expected. I can only imagine what the place will look like come January. It is nothing that would deter me bc as I said, facility is impressive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This hotel is very disappointing.  When you enter, you notice the indoor atrium with trees and water.  It doesn't make you feel you're in the middle of the desert, I mean Phoenix.  Checking in was a breeze.  You get a free bottle of water if you're a Hilton member.  I was waiting for mine since my colleague got one and checked in before me.  Then I found out it's only free if you're a member.  Thanks.  I don't want to pay $4 for a bottle of water in my room that has been sitting there for a month or two.\n\nMy room was okay.  An old hotel stench.  Bed was comfortable enough.  Bathroom was very slow.  The flush seems like the toilet is clogged when flushing.  As for the shower/tub, my room was draining super duper slow.  I could have requested another room, but I already unpacked.  And the A/C is super loud in the room.  It can spook you at times.\n\nIt is across the mall, so that's convenient.  Other than that, I've experienced better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I just had a final horrible experience at this animal hospital. I've have gone here thankfully a handful of times, and each time I'd been surprised at the lack of friendliness, expensive fees and long wait times in the exam room. But it is nearby and I did not change vets. On this visit I went and was shown to a wait room, and was told the vet would be in shortly. I had my 2 year old toddler with me and the dog, waiting patiently, knowing there would be a wait, but of course this wait went on and on and on and on. After 20 minutes, I poked my head out the door and asked if the doctor could come soon since I also had a toodler in the room with me. Then I turned back in and my toddler had climbed on the seat next to the exam table and fell off and bumped her head. I expressed that I shouldn't have to wait so long, and that this isn't the first time and they had their doctor reasons but this does not change that they charge a large fee like all doctors for a short amount of time and the least they could do is not make people wait so long and have a little care and respect for their clientle. I spoke to the office manager and she refused to extend any courtsey for the incident due to the long wait. Needless to say, I will not give them my business again and I think you should think twice about visiting this place! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite movie theater in the South Hills area. It's been recently remodeled which makes it really nice. Located in the Galleria. \n\nSeats are huge and comfortable. Plenty of leg room and large arm rests. Overall the entire theater seemed clean, including bathrooms. \n\nAs expected, prices on candy, popcorn, drinks, etc, are of course outrageous. This theater does offer a popcorn bucket which you can buy and use for the entire year giving you a discount on future popcorn purchases. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Two stars lost for unprofessional attitude/behavior of junior manicurist, one star lost because of lack of management over said employee, & one star (should be two) lost because of end product:   noticeably weird angle of nail/ nail bed for 6 of 10 nails (actually noticed by male coworkers who NEVER notice 'lady things').\n\nHad decided to get a set of gel nails (after not having them for years), as I'm hosting a conference of women coming to town, and I wanted to see if I could recommend them for visitors. Prior good reviews left me favorably disposed toward this salon; however, my experience was disappointing at best.  I will be routing about 300 women elsewhere. \n\nThe owner/manager (pretty adult woman) started the nailbed preparation, and selected/glued on the tips to start my manicure.  NO complaints here- she seemed personable, competent, and really seemed to take care to ensure that the correct curve/flatness of each nail bed was matched according to the actual nail- I was really happy.\n\nHowever, it seemed that a regular customer (likely for a more expensive service) came in, so the owner/manager had a girl come over to take over the rest of my service.   \n\nThe girl did not seem to be happy to do so, as she was on the phone (one of two phones she juggled during the ENTIRE service), trying to straighten out some issue with a purchase of jeans on line.  She was barely on autopilot as she commenced with my nail application. \n\nShe literally DID NOT EVEN LOOK at my nails as she buffed/grinded away at the nail beds- am convinced as to that's why the final angles are so weird on them (hard for me to see at the time, as I'd not had nails for a long time, and could not really give them a good look during the process)..  \n\nWhen she did speak to me- it was to order me around several times (get nail polish color, pay, go wash up, go dry) and was very abrupt with every command, even though I'm at least twice her age, a paying customer, not a subordinate.\n\nIt was NOT a case of second-language/cultural translation -this girl was acting like a petulant b-word, full stop - to a person who was sincerely being nice to her, and who just didn't remember all of the ropes (nor should I have had to do so!).\n \nShe literally left the salon for an extended period (upwards of 20 minutes)during the time that my nails were curing under the uV.  A nice man clicked the light on again for another cycle after the first curing, but the curing went on for FOUR light cycles before she deigned to return to the job. \n\nWhen she did, she ordered me to wash my hands.  I did go to the back of the shop, saw clean and soiled receptacles for nail scrub brushes, and figured out that I should likely used the clean brush, scrub up, and then place the used brush in the oher receptacle - all assumed because she didn't deign to actually tell me ANYTHING (was AGAIN heading out a doorway with her phone).\n.  \nThere was a hot towel available for use- she had slapped it down on the counter on her way out, and God knows what was on the counter (though the place did seem to be clean, and I did notice the man take special care to sterilize/clean a pedicure station after a client while I was there).\n\nI did end up using it, but had no place to put the used towel.  She actually acted annoyed with me as she brought forth a hamper for me to place the towel.  \n\nAfter the application of the polish/topcoat, etc.- she pointed vaguely to an area in the back of the salon & told me to go there.  I then discerned that I was to put my hands under a light table to dry/cure the nails- but AGAIN- the communication was abrupt, rude, and uninformative.  \n\nI guess I didn't spend enough time under the light table (had no real idea how long to stay there), so I headed out, loaded up an elderly family member in the car, and noticed a mar on my middle fingernail.  No big deal- this happens- they'll fix it (based on prior experience).\n\nOn my return, she literally YELLED at me, in front of employees and other customers, for messing up my nail- told me that I should have stayed under the table for 15 minutes & to be careful for an hour thereafter.  RIGHT- I'm not going to fasten a seatbelt, insert a car key, etc. after I leave the salon.  Beyond that- YELLING AT CIVIL CUSTOMERS IS WRONG.. Again, petulant, abrupt, unreasonable -after I'd tipped 60+ cents/nail (for an ultimately lousy set of nails).\n\nAll delays caused my nail appointment to reach the near two-hour mark for a simple set of gel nails (and I was so steamed thereafter that I missed an important appointment due to the distraction.).\n\nAm certain this place is great if they deign to consider you to be a regular- there was a disabled man who came in for a manicure, and the man who attended him did so with a tender respect which I found heartening. \n\nHowever, that does not erase the facts of my own experience.  I would return ONLY if I could guarantee an appointment with the adult employees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Had the chance to FINALLY try this place the other night.  Italian food isn't usually our first choice, but our interest ( and hunger) got the better of us that night. The place is very cozy...not over done in Italian motif and very unpretentious.  We were seated quickly and after being served water we treated to a review of some delicious sounding specials.  We chatted  a bit about it and decided on the Veal Osso Bucco and Scallops, both in a wine sauce,  with pasta and vegetables.  Before our meals came, we were treated to some awesome piping hot bread!  We would have had more, but wanted to save room for dinner.....we would go there just for the bread! \nOur waiter was very attentive and it didn't take long for our food to arrive.   Fabulous choices!  Both the veal and the fish were super tender and left us wanting more...even though we were stuffed.  The scallops were pretty big and they threw in a few jumbo shrimp on top for good measure.....also perfectly cooked.  The pasta was also prepared just right and the vegetables were the best we have ever been served.  Our order was not cheap, however we are interested in coming back to try some of the regular items on the menu.  The meal was topped of with a complimentary shot of chilled ammaretto....delish! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After so may 4 and 5 star reviews I decided to give Taylor's another chance after my first visit, thinking perhaps I just had a bad experience and this place really is as great as everyone raves.. So now on to my second dining adventure and I am still not impressed. \nThe place is cute, it has a great charm and ambiance, really a perfect setting for a causal breakfast or lunch. The food is decent, but nothing exceptional and extremely overpriced.. My first time I had the huevos rancheros and they really should have been called huevos gringos. The dish consisted of beans folded into a wheat tortilla with a fried egg and very bland tomatillo sauce, what side do you get for 9.25$ - chips...needing more than chips I added a side of potatoes ($3),  I split this dish and was charged ($2) without even being asked.. Bringing the total dish to $14.25.. Get real for breakfast? .  I compare this dish to Harlow's huevos rancheros.. there is $7.95 and comes with potatoes and beans and tortillas..\nMy second visit I ordered the \""create your own omelet\"" for $10.75, this seemed high for an omelet but I went with it.. It was pretty good, but again the side... toast or a bagel, order the potatoes ($3) and another split plate charge ($2) without being asked.. Let me rant on this one for a moment.. They charge me $2 to cut my omlettee in half.. The bagel already comes sliced. LAME, bring it on one plate and I can cut it myself..it is not like we got double portions.. very annoying. So now the omelet is $15.95 ridiculous. Add an OJ.. $5 bucks! When most places have $3 mimosas on Sundays I found paying $5 for an OJ ridiculous. So in all Taylor's food is decent, but with so many good and lower priced options in the nearby area, I don't seem myself going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible horrible company!!! If you're on a budget don't come here, they'll RIP you off!! \n\nWe rented a car 10/4/14 through 10/6/14 for my sister in law. She was added and we added the additional budget insurance. She brought the car back dirty. But not dirty enough to rack up 250$ of detailing fees! They took photos and sent them via email. Talking about stains. Believe me, there was no stains! There was some crumbs on the seat and some dirt on the floors but nothing a vacuum couldn't handle. Now, I don't know what the intentions were of the employees that service the vehicles, but I'm suspecting they get a bonus for every car they detail, or somebody wants a raise! You know it don't cost 250$ to detail a car! \n\nI've been trying to handle this manner but talk about BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, I have yet spoken to a supervisor about theses excessive fees! I've called the Budget 800#  and I've spoken to countless representatives, why, because they can't get it right the first time and the supervisor can only call you or email you back within 24-48 hours!\n\nThis company is a joke. If you run into trouble with these guys, it's a pure run around! I will be looking into exposing this company for what they are, greedy uncaring scheming business operators! I really want to call them something else right now! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been coming to this place for many years now. \nMy daughter bought me a great vacuum here one year for Christmas.\nIt truly is a great vacuum.\nEvery year they over a free tune up. Where they had always cleaned it up,changed the bag and made sure it was in good shape for me.\nSome years I had not taken it in,because I was traveling an incredible amount of time for work. So I had a cleaning service come in. Which they used their own vacuum.\nLast year I took it in and they kept it for 2 days and when I went to pick it up they had not changed the bag even..Hmmm,that makes me wonder if they did anything.\n\nAnyway,this time I took it in on a Saturday. The man working (who may of been the owner) said I will do it right now if you can just wait a few min.\nThis was a first, usually I have to leave it.\nIn a very short time he brought it out nice and clean,with a new bag and said it looked great.\nI bought some new bags and I was on my way. Fabulous!\nWhat a great experience.\nA few people came in after me. Which is even a better experience, because, he took the time to fully help me. \nIf you are going to get an Oreck, this is the place to go. <|endoftext|>

We've been extremely happy with the service and honesty of this dealership. We had bad experiences at one of the other big dealerships in town and it was refreshing to go to Shelby and find salespeople who were not high pressure and a service department that fixed things right. I've always been happy with their service and I'm pleased that Chrysler took their dealership away from that other place and turned it over to Shelby! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Daily Illini - Has gotten better recently, but its a crap paper altogether. The stories are poorly written and usually cite Facebook as reference. Most articles are obviously biased, and the op ed staff is full of full blown morons.\n\nWPGU - Best radio station in town, but still a bad radio station. They play some indie songs, but its really obvious they try to be indie by playing really cliche songs many times. Also, the DJ's are inept.\n\nTechnograph - eh.\n\nThe Buzz - Only reason this is getting 2 stars. Good local music reviews, and a good crossword. This and the booze news are the only things worth reading while siting at Antonio's eating lunch. <|endoftext|>

I called their office at 8:45am and was able to see the doctor at 9:30am. The staff was courteous, friendly and professional. They took an x-ray and then consulted with me while showing me the x-ray and the huge amount of infection. Dr. Davis wrote a prescription for antibiotic and pain killer and said go home, rest and take care of yourself and come back in a week so we can do some work on that tooth. AMAZING attitude and so professional yet personable. I will be referring Dr. Davis for sure! Thank You Dr. Davis and staff! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They Price-Gouge when you renew your lease. 10 - 12  weeks before your lease expires they send a renewal notice with the new higher lease rate. This rate is only good for 2 weeks then it expires. The next renewal notice is for Higher lease rate - good for 2 weeks. A total of 5 renewal notices / rate increases before the original lease expired!  The final renewal notice for highest rate will cost you an additional $250 - $300 per year. \nI submit that  this practice is a form of Predatory Leasing and may even be grounds for a class action lawsuit. Anyone interested? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would not recommend working with Toys R US for your baby registry. I was told by a manager that he would contact us within 3 weeks when a registry item was ready to be purchased (which is often in high demand)and never received a call. Then was told it was in my best interest to purchase the item immediately bc they might run out from the distributer when I took the time to contact them after five weeks with no contact. Also, I have been waiting for two months to purchase a toddler rail for the conversion crib but they have yet to be available for order. Why have conversion cribs on the floor on display if you can not order the parts for it? Furthermore, we received the wrong item when it was shipped to our home when we ordered it in store. This was no the fault of the store staff worker. When we are in the store all staff members have been helpful. If I could do it all over again though, I would not have registered here. It has been a headache! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.\n\nIn my phoenix and dragon I had five \""jumbo\"" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \""spicy chicken\"" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \""spicy\"" sauce that wasn't very good.\n\nI also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.\n\nI suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, \""Oh, you just called. It's almost there,\"" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot. So there's that.\n\ntl;dr small portions, not jumbo shrimp, not spicy, not very good, long wait, unfriendly staff on the phones, friendly drivers, and they litter my apartment building a lot. <|endoftext|>

After waiting almost an hour they told me it was unrepairable and tried to get me to buy a new tire. They were originally purchased at Fletcher's so I brought it there instead, hoping it was under warrantee.

A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel.

The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had the most horrendous experience at this place. Besides dealing with a very rude doctor (Erin O'Sullivan) -- she talks about other patients, has a knack for making you feel like a fool for asking a question or being concerned, and was flat out mean during the birth... she acted like I had inconvenienced her -- I had to have surgery nine weeks after my baby was born for a fistula. Very LONG (and physically painful) story short: After dealing with some post-tear issues, which required restitching at the two week mark by Steven Nelson (I was done with O'Sullivan), I thought I was on the mend. I saw Nelson a few more times after that. At the seven week mark, Nelson said that there was a small hole (about 7mm deep) and he cleared me. I decided to get a second opinion, just in case... an extra hole \""down there\"" concerned me. Good thing I did. The hole was, in fact, a fistula and I had to have surgery to repair the damage. The recovery time from that: another 6 weeks. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and consider another doctor/practice. It was my first and I wish I had listened to my gut in the middle of pregnancy and moved on. There's no reason you should have a lousy experience when there are so many great OBs out there who want you to have a fabulous pregnancy and birthing experience. <|endoftext|>

So it was easy to go there over my lunch. Now in 07, I moved to Seattle and back to Phoenix in 08. Even though I live clear across town about 20-25 mins drive, I still would never go to another dentist. Besides the great service which I have become accustomed to, they also have video games in the waiting room (when I have my 10 yr old nephew), flats screens in the back, and of course those awesome cookies, with juice and water in the fridge waiting for you afterwards!  I've never waited too long before any appointment. I typically get there right on time, and they are ready for me. Love them, Love them, Love them. I always have the same Hygienist too. I feel like I'm going to see an old friend. This is as good as it gets. <|endoftext|>

I appreciate that.\n\nDon't get the impression that cops at Pomeroy's is a common occurrence, it's not. Don't you dare let my review that includes a 1/2 assed bar fight dissuade you from coming here. I'm still planning on coming back here, AGAIN! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love the Cash. It is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink on.\n\nWe have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the Cash. They always have a great turnout.\n\nThe crowd is extremely diverse. The drinks are good and cheap, and the bar staff is very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nice and accommodating wait staff. That was about it. Parking is weird. The front entrance is not where the parking lot is. It's on a side street. Then when you walk in you have to keep your kids from putting their hands in the algae filled fountain. I think the goldfish live off algae. They do wedding receptions there if you're into that sort of thing. The salsa and chips are overrated. The carne asada burrito was horrible. It tasted like charred asada. The kids liked the kids menu, but I've definitely had much better Mexican food. Please clean the algae filled fountain. Goldfish deserve better! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Such a jewel here in Phoenix.    The Heard Museum has one of  the best Native American presentations.     It is well thought out and exhibits continue to change to wet your appetite for another visit.    It is a must visit whenever you are in Phoenix.   I highly recommend that you visit the Heard Museum. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Owner Liz and her staff did a great job with my Austrailian Shepard Mix, Shelby. Shelby is very shy and always hates to leave my side, but Liz was there at the front door to make her feel very welcome and comfortable. I picked up Shelby after a couple of hours and she was smiling and wagging her tail like she just went through a full day spa treatment. SPOILED!\n\nOn a side note they also sell some great locally made dog treats that Shelby just loved. Love the idea!! I will always use their services!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family and I have been eating at Pizzeria Bianco for years as a special occasion place, so when I heard they had a sandwich shop I had to visit! It was definitely a bit of a drive, since I'm all the way out in Glendale right now, but I figured it would probably be worth it. \n\nThey have a very small storefront; the bulk of the space is the baking operation and sandwich-making in the back - and I could tell because it was all open. I love being able to see the food I'm about to eat being made (who doesn't?) and seeing/smelling the fresh bread coming out of the oven definitely upped my anticipation. The staff was really friendly, which is always a plus. I ordered two sandwiches, the tuna and the soppressata, and they were ready within 5 minutes, still all nice and warm. Unfortunately, I had to cart them all the way back to Glendale so my boyfriend could get his, so I didn't get to taste mine fresh.\n\nHe said his was awesome, and had never had roasted red peppers that were so delicious, but I was slightly more on the fence about my tuna. Not that it wasn't good, it was a great quality sandwich and the bread was amazing. I think it was just the flavor combination for me, I guess I'm used to my tuna being seasoned a certain way, and having something so different wasn't quite up my alley. But knowing their quality now, I will certainly be back to try something else.\n\nI will say that the price was slightly high, which I expected, but I was a little disappointed that the prices on their website are incorrect. My sandwich was $9.50 and my boyfriend's was $9, instead of the $8 posted on their website. \n\nIn summary, good food, good experience, I'd come back if I had some extra money in my bank account and was craving a delicious sandwich on high quality bread. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible experience...not like the stores.  The corporate heads have lost touch with the customers.  Never experience corporate till now....I sent back items which were not what I ordered and received a note saying that they have been retagged....did not know what this was until they explained it to me.  As I have bought thousands of dollars from them and referred many friends who have done the same....I was stunned.  As I got shifted around to corporate management who have lost touch with the customer experience...it became apparent that they did not want to help but make excuses for their mistake and put blame on me.\n\nWhat I did find from the managers who are friends at the stores that I did shop at was that this is happening more lately and she heard that they need to move slow inventory to reduce inventory....hence tagging items incorrectly and then sending them out.  When you try to return them they blantantly blame you for shady practices and if you make waves they ask you not to shop at their store.  This way they can get rid of you without having to replace anything....hence move inventory that they can't sell and financial books look good.\n\nI am appalled at this experience with On Line and Corporate....if you want to move slow inventory put it on sale or donate it.....don't make me pay for something I don't want.  Be wary of ordering on line!!!!!!  Also make sure you check the quality of what you buy....with jeans check the alignment of the back pockets since most are crooked and shirts check the seams also since mis-aligned.....you are paying a higher price so expect higher quality and top notched customer service.  Also I would recommend Nordstroms, they have the same price products sometimes cheaper, with better quality and exceptional customer service and return policy...they stand by what they sell. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seemed like a nice place. However, after waiting in line for 20 minutes and taking quite a while to give our order (because it was VERY loud) we were told that it would take about 30 minutes to get our food. Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine. When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit/credit cards. Cash or check only!! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99% of the people there probably never saw the sign. This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards. Even worse is the BS sign on the register. I will never eat here again just because of this! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't see the big deal about this place! Food it ok. A little over price for what you get! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Super clean venue! Always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game, a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end! \n\nThe wife and I grabbed some custom jerseys as we! I'm pretty sure we've adopted the suns as our new nba team <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place to buy golf balls! Pro v1, Calloway , and Titleist balls have been used but not abused. Cheap <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr\u00e9e too, but at least it was edible.)\n\nI finally think I'm done with this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been meaning to give the place a review, but I can be forgetful. My husband and I ate here recently at the suggestion of his sister. We started off with soups; I went with the hot and sour soup and my husband chose the won-ton soup. I was extremely pleased with my choice, because in my experience hot and sour soup is a very hit or miss dish. I've tried many I wasn't satisfied with, but their soup had a wonderful, vibrant flavor. It also had shredded pork, which I'm not really accustomed to it having, but it was delicious. My husband liked his soup as well, though good  won-ton soup is much easier to find. I ordered the Cashew Chicken, which consists of chicken, cashews, water chestnuts, pea pods, mushrooms, and carrots. I liked the flavor of the Cashew Chicken, but it didn't really stand out for me compared to the same dish at other restaurants. My husband ordered the General Tsao Chicken and he was pretty pleased with what he had. They  also brought out a big plate of white rice for us to share from; the rice was cooked well and sticky. Our server was also very attentive, she made sure our drinks were filled and checked up on us often. The prices were decent and I'd be happy to go back whenever I'm in Madison. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I can't say enough good things about Dr. Laris and his staff.   I use Dr. Laris mainly for cosmetic work .  He is so kind, thorough, knowledgeable and very cutting edge with all his techniques.  I have had CO2 laser, Ultherapy (amazing results) and recently filler.  I was very reluctant and nervous to have filler but he was conservative and skillful.  I am thrilled with the results.  Between the Ultherapy and filler I feel like 7 years have come off.  I highly, highly recommend Phoenix Skin. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Majerles will not be on my list of go-to places the next time I am in the Phoenix area.\n\nOrdered a Caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a side of avocado.  I feel like this is one of the few things you really cannot mess up when dining out anywhere, but the plate I had at Majerles was supremely subpar - there weren't many pieces of shrimp on the salad.  It was mostly a big plate of green with a few shrimps and they weren't well-seasoned either.  A few pieces of shrimp were really bland and then some were over-seasoned with whatever spice they threw on there.  The side of avocados was not a pleasant sight, they actually gave it to me on a small plate and the slices were half-browned by the time the plate arrived on the table.  Sure, I occasionally eat partially-browned avocados at home in my own kitchen, but I wouldn't serve it up to someone if I owned my own restaurant!  \n\nThe service was attentive, but not overbearing.  Our server was really nice.  I'd be much more interested exploring the other dining options that are available in the area instead of returning to Majerles next time I'm in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had not been here for a few years but glad that I decided to come back.  I had their penne pasta with meat sauce and it was a huge portion with great flavor.  I really like their red sauce, it had a lot of flavor and was rich.  My bf had their meatball sub which again was a huge portion and he liked it a lot.  Next time we come back we will have to try their pizza!  Great job and keeping up with the times Streets of NY! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been getting mani/pedi's for the last 30 years and this was by far the worst I have ever had.  First, I have nevery had a 10 spa pedicure, this woman was so fast and had no attention to detail.  It wasn't like there was anyone else in the place.  She spent almost no time on my feet with a pumice stone, maybe three seconds per foot unless you paid the up-charge for the callus remover.  When I got home I clipped my own toe nails straight as I think she was trying to make them in the shape of a mountain range.  Next time, I will go back to my pretty little nail salon on Northern and 12th and drive the extra couple of miles for a fantastic mani/pedi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion.  I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to.  \n\nBut if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was \""up\"" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.  \n\nBesides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap!  I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> ONO doesn't begin to cover how amazing this food is!\n\ni grew up in Hawaii and, although NOTHING will ever stand up to the food on the island, this place comes pretty damn close as far as \""plate lunch\"" goes.  \n\nthe chicken katsu is good, the spam musubi (awesome snack when you're out surfing for the day...a personal fave) is wonderfully delicious...i LOVE the sauce they put under the spam...i'm thinking it's the katsu sauce, but i could be wrong.  my fave tho is the island curry chicken.  it has a kick, but it's freakin AWESOME!  the macaroni salad is to die for...my advice, if you're feeling naughty, skip the rice and ask for two scoops of the macaroni salad...totally worth the calories.\n\noh, more advice.  go for the mini meal.  it might sound small, but it is the PERFECT size!  just enough to fill you up!\n\nmahalo to whatever lolo brought this grub out to all the haoles in phx! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just AWFUL!  Not only did we have to ask and get our own menus.... we had to get our own drinks and order our food at the bar.  No server to be found or that checked on us.  To top it off... the Mac and Cheese that I ate got me sick!!!! NEVER again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was actually a bit disappointed by my latest experience at C's. I've had better. Typically I would give it a 3-star but some of the service wasn't the greatest and my food was cold...\n\nC's is the kind of family-friendly experience that makes it a 3 to 4 star restaurant on a good day, but on this particular day, our primary server was impatient and lacked a customer-first attitude and the quality of food was lacking. However, the service for a never less then half empty coffee mug, was superb. \n\nI do love the bakery items so couldn't resist the pecan roll, but my egg sandwich with hash browns could have been better. The hash browns were cold and the croissant was dry. The bacon however, crispy, just like I requested.\n\nBut, I was with my family, we were tucked in a cozy corner booth, had great conversation and due to the history of this restaurant and the many times I've been there before, it would be a place I would recommend. I guess the day I was there was just an \""off day\"". That happens. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been going to this place for about 8 years. I always make an appointment with Van. He is very detailed and methodical about doing nails. His pedicure is the best I have ever had, bar none. I have gone in with a migraine and after a pedicure, have left without one.\n\nThe general ambience of the place could be updated but they are very busy and the people keep coming. The price is very reasonable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here with my In-Laws who were craving good Chinese. So my friends at work recommended Baoding, and I decided to take a chance and go. Boy am I glad we did! Authentic Chinese? Not so sure. Yummy? You bet! \n\nMy Father-in-law had the wonton soup, and he raved at the complexity and depth of the broth. The potstickers were good, just wish they were a LITTLE more crispy. But they were very tasty....just picking. The veggie egg rolls were yummy too.\n\nWe ordered 4 full entrees, and threw in their Singapore noodles to make it 5. I've got to say that EVERYTHING was very tasty! The dishes that featured Chicken was REAL chunks of Chicken, not 90% breading with a tad of Chicken. Had their Tangerine beef which was good, but I would like to see a tad LESS Tangerine bits in the dish. Tasty nonetheless. General Tao's was very yummy too.\n\nAll in all, a VERY tasty meal in a town generally lacking good Chinese (except for Dragonfly off Park Road which is equally yummy).\n\nDefinitely will return to try other tasty morsels! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My wife and I, who are vegetarians, ordered a couple tofu burritos and we each found a chuck of meat in ours.  Additionally, the staff misplaced our take-out ticket so it wasn't ready when we arrived and once it was made, they forgot an ingredient.  I would give this place one-star, but when we called the manager, he was very kind and offered a free meal.  Because of him, I'll give it another try, and I may potentially update this review. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This bar is not for everyone, and its location leaves much to be desired... however, I can't help but love this place. It's a little bit of a trek for me, so I don't go very often - however, I do try to go as much as I can. \n\nWhen smoking was allowed, this place was difficult to breathe in. Now it's much nicer. The food is delicious I think, but I've had friends tell me they weren't so pleased... most people I talk to though seem to like it. There are booths that seat about 5 people. The seats are high and make it somewhat private. The bar is huge and they have waitstaff, so it's fairly easy to get a drink usually. It's also seldom crowded which is nice. \n\nThey host their own free poker nights with prizes... there's also pool, darts, and plenty of televisions to watch soccer on. G&D could use a bit of a facelift, but it's holding up well. The waitresses and bartenders are pretty hot and look like they could be suicide girls. There's usually someone good looking in there - but no pressure to be good looking or dressed up yourself. It's very casual. The place has a bit of a punky edge to it - most of the regulars seem to be into that. If that's \""your people\"" then you should go check it out. If these aren't your people and you want to check it out - don't feel intimidated... everyone there is pretty nice. I should also mention that there's lots of beer on tap and the mixed drinks are usually really strong.\n\nI'm realizing now that I need to come up with a formula for my reviews so they are more uniform and aren't so chaotic. Basically, G&D is a good place to go for a British Pub experience in the valley, but it's really more of a neighborhood bar full of regulars than a hot spot. Totally worth checking out though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place gets 5 stars for their entrees. No doubt about it, every meal I have ever ordered from here over the last few years has been delectable and phenomenal. The service is  also top notch. The 1 star deduction is a matter of personal taste for their desserts. They taste very fresh, but I haven't been overly enthused about the choices of flavors.  \n\nThey have a fantastic happy hour menu too!\n\nOn the meal side, I would like to personally recommend any of the following treats:\n\nCalifornia Crunchy Roll\nSpicy Tuna Roll\nNegi-Hama Roll\nTekka Roll\nShrimp Tempura Roll\nCrunch Eel Roll\nDragon Roll\nTyphoon Roll\nRainbow Roll\n\nArrabbiata Italian Pasta w/ Hamaguri (little neck clams)\nCapellini w/ Tomato and Garlic\nPrimavera\nPescatore\n\nIka Yakisoba\nChampon (the aroma from this one is nearly orgasmic)\nPad Thai\nKorean Spicy Beef\n\nCha-shu Ramen\nMixed Tempura Dinner\n***Orange Roughy w/ Orange Sauce (I can not overstate that this is my FAVORITE of their dishes so far)***\nYakiniku\n\nHave I mentioned that I love this place? There are still so many other items to try! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm normally one to shy away from restaurants that appear (inside and out) as if they're going to give me the worst case of E. Coli/Salmonella/Asbestos/Gun-shot wounds I've ever had.\n\nBut I just don't care when it comes to Carolinas!  Having worked at Sky Harbor for few years I ate here too often to count and never had a bad experience.\n\nJust don't look too closely at your surroundings when you're picking up your grub! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Finally went to this restaurant, now I understand the hype!  I loved what I had ordered.  The Thai corn chowder is awesome -so flavorful.  The flat bread with hummus - delicious (the hummus had a citrus taste to it).  The avocado maki roll was also great.  Service was excellent.  We sat outside on the balcony - beautiful and comfortable. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This restaurant is truly a gem to have here in Phoenix.  Everything they serve here is fresh, beautiful, and well constructed.  The owner, Greg, is the nicest guy you will meet and he goes out of his way to treat his customers in such a humble and hospitable way.  He also has a standard set for quality at the restaurant that cannot be beat.   The white anchovies they serve are special ordered by the owner from somewhere in Europe I presume, and are unlike any others I have tasted, fresh, delicate and not very salty at all.  The meat dishes and seafood are amazing.   The fish is fresh and wild caught.  In particular, the shrimp and scallops are the jumbo kind, not the cheap stuff,  which the owner also special orders.\n         When eating here you feel as if you should not be able to get such quality fresh food in Phoenix, particularly the seafood dishes.  The sauces are the best I have had, the red sauce is orgasmic.  Plates are artfully constructed and beautiful as they are yummy.  Prices are not cheap, but you get what you pay for, and on that note the value is quite apparent here as they do not skimp on anything here to save money.  Portions here are big.  You really feel you are getting great value with the amazing food they serve here.  Raviolis are so thin and delicate. Yum. \n        Great wine, great atmosphere, great service.  If you are looking for VERY authentic Italian food in a charming and romantic setting, this place truly can not be beat.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).\n\nI had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).\n\nThe atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Facts: I am not a big meat eater.  I am not a vegan, vegetarian or any combo.  I like good food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable.  \n\nAll that being said, I have searching a place that serves great burgers.  I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that I order a burger.  So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro's.  I expected a dive with somewhat gruff service.  Uh, no, Tessaro's is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight.  And the service was tremendous.  Yes it was a Thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! That makes sense to me.  No use taking up a table with a partial party who is \""faffing.\"" (Google term if confused)\n  \nI had a medium rare burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  The beef was good!!  This means a lot coming from me a non-meat eater.  The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.  Mr. Handsome devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction.  Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.\n\nWill be recommending Tessaro's to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!\n\nPS there are options for non-meat eaters:) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have some mixed feelings about Mama Ricotta's, but ultimately I leave the restaurant pretty happy and satisfied every time.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that they took the Butternut Squash Ravioli off the menu... WHY??!?! I truly loved this dish!!  The raviolis themselves were plump and yummy, the squash was rich and creamy, and balanced out with walnuts. Who knows why, no one ever wants to give me a straight answer. Apparently a lot of people still request the dish, so occasionally they will stock the ingredients just to randomly prepare it... but still, I would eat here all the time if they kept this!\n\nInstead I've ordered the Penna Alla Vodka (minus the pancetta) and the Ravioli Alla Fiorentina. These are both pretty good and would definitely recommend them, but they're just not the same!!!\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip! This stuff is off the chain amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! \n\nI like the dark, cozy feel of the restaurant with drum shade lighting. Thumbs up to the high ratio of booth seating. Worst thing about the decor here are the ridiculous pasta paintings. Good God, the color schemes on these things are hideous. Someone needs to remove those, ASAP.\n\nService here has been mixed, 85% of the time waiters have been quick, polite, and right on. But I have had an occasional dud.\n\nThe prices here are a little high, expect to spend over $12 a person minimum. The good news is they have coupons in the Charlotte Citipass book! Buy One, Get One baby! \n\nExpect a wait on the weekends (10-20 minutes at least). Parking is limited for the volume of weekend customers, so expect a hike. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just about every you need.\n\nWith great hours, a solid hot bar, sushi (if you're into that),  a dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons of produce, bakery and butchers counter you can't go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front. I always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back, super annoying. \n\nThat said its a small, and easily repairable (hint) issue that shouldn't keep you from visiting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was in Charlotte for a class and stayed here. It was really nice, and the staff was great! I had never stayed alone in a hotel and got upset while eating in their restaurant and the wait staff took care of my meal! It was so nice! I can't say enough nice things about them! They made my trip better and made me feel so welcome! I'd definitely stay there again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dear Miracle Mile,\n\nThis is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.\n\nUnless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. \n\nStale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.\n\nAnd then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! \n\nAlthough I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \""Next? Bread?\"" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. \""Fries?\"" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. \""Drink?\"" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!\n\nWait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.\n\nWell I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. \n\nWishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,\nErica <|endoftext|>

We arrived around 7:30 and it wasn't crowded so we took a couple of seats at the bar. Rose, the bartender, was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink. Of course I chose a Southern Tier 2X IPA and he chose a Yuengling, Rose knew all of her regulars and was friendly with everyone. The owners were actually sitting at the bar at the same time and seemed to know most of the regulars as well. For my meal, I ordered the getaway signature wrap (romaine lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, diced chicken, mandarin oranges and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic dressing). I asked for no walnuts and a nice surprise as well was the fact that there were craisins in the wrap too. With just the right amount of balsalmic spread throughout the wrap, this was very tasty. I chose fries as my side and those were good as well. My boyfriend has eaten here several times and said the wings (particularly the cajun) are tasty as is the quesadilla (which is so huge you can order just a half), and the Reuben, however, last night he chose the steak hoagie (Thin sliced grilled sirloin and provolone \ncheese on a toasted 8\"" hoagie roll with lettuce and tomatoes). He said it was tasty and he would order it again. Their desserts are from Signature desserts and they all looked delicious! We chose the pumpkin cheesecake. It had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and was not overpowering. A very tasty seasonal treat! It's hard to find a combination of good service and good food and we found it here so we will be back in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First off let me say that I am definitely a city girl so restaurants like Esquire are not really my type. I have dietary restrictions and I need to be picky. I came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on Sunday. It seemed to be the only place open. I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.\n\nOverall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion. \n\nThe servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Finding a Family Doctor can be difficult and I have been having a rough time doing so since my former Doctor retired recently.  The requirements I had were...\n1.  MD\n2.  Office with one or two doctors...I hate when there are a bunch of people in the waiting room( especially gross sick ones ugh!).\n3.  Friendly, staff that actually returns calls!\n4.  Doctor that doesn't make you feel rushed and listens to your issues!\n5.  Easy to access, not in a big building that is hard to park in.\n6.  Available appointments.\n\nDr. Riley is all these things and more.  I'm  really happy with the ease and the great medical care.  His nurses are good with needles as well.  I had to get my blood taken and a few shots and she performed like a pro with confidence!\n\nSo, if you are in need of a new Doctor I highly recommend Dr. Riley.  I think they also take most insurances as well! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have always had comfortable and easy experiences at Sky Harbor in the past, but I must say I had the best experience at the PHX airport last week which really topped it all off!\n\nTraveling at Thanksgiving time is not for the faint of heart with long lines, pushy people, and lots of crying children everywhere. Not once did I see the staff at Sky Harbor even grimace. Everyone I encountered was so genuinely friendly and helpful, from the rental car shuttle driver, to the TSA agents, to the counter workers. I forgot to remove my liquids from my carry-on (gasp!) and the agent who inspected my bag did so quickly and sent me on my way with a \""Happy Thanksgiving!\"" I have had similar issues at airports in the past where a simple search may turn into an ordeal. The lines moved briskly despite the throngs of people and the airport is nice & clean. Terminal 4 has a Paradise Bakery and free wifi. I really couldn't ask for anything more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is poor quality ingredients in a fast food, order at counter from the wall and they'll give you a number and bring it to you. Staff was sullen. Noodles were greasy and flavorless as were the spring rolls. Won't go back. I will say that the place looked clean. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good selection, well organized, friendly staff!  \n\nOn my quest to explore Pittsburgh, I stopped by Eons and ended up trying on a few things.

I don't have artificial nails, and I've always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day!!!  I don't know what Gina does, but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week, and then they don't chip, they merely wear at the tips. And the toe polish lasts weeks & weeks! \n\nThe warm 'bucky' on the shoulders is an added bonus as are the complimentary neck/shoulder massages (when the masseuse has time) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm on the hated-it scale of the Honey Bear love fest.  \n\nWe ordered the bbq ribs and a beef sandwich with cole slaw and cowbro beans on the side.  Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were \""bloody\""...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq pork\n\nI actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another try\n\nIf you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a craving <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Too much cheese on their pizzas, and the customer service is incredibly poor.  This is nothing new, we have been in Brighton Heights for many years.  My husband LOVES their buffalo chicken pizza, but after his last experience waiting over an hour for pick up, we would only order from Chubby's if every other local pizza joint was closed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.\n\nCarpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast, some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.\n\nI have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit, it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it, and she replied, \""They've always cooked it rare\"". \n\nThe crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But, most nice restaurants do, so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby, but also include either tuemeric or curry, which is entirely unexpected, and does not add to the dish.\n\nTheir famous salad: The Waldhorn salad, baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us, it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!\n\nBring your own water, service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!\n\nWe've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ordered for take-out.  Was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly.  When I showed up, the restaurant was pretty quiet and I was able to pay for my food and go in about three minutes.  I payed $10.45 for a large cheese pizza.  The pizza was nice and hot, but was mediocre in taste.    I ended up having to jazz it up at home with some basil, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder.\n\nThere was a sign outside advertising the lunch buffet for $6.99, but I don't know that it's worth the money.  I can tell you that based on my the pizza I ate, I won't be ordering from them again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Really needs attention from its Chef owner. What happened? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Husband and I decided to try this place out based on the great Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!  We ordered takeout, and weren't too adventures.  I ordered the Beef Panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish.  Both were delicious, the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the Panang had just the right amount of spice.  One of my main complaints with the local Thai eateries is that they generally do not provide much spicy kick, but Wild Thaiger knows how to pack the punch.  Definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you can't take the heat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive!\n\nHowever, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Lately the quality of service at Panda has definitely deminished. I've have been a customer for a long time. When I ask for my plate to be made the way I like it I've been argued with by the employees. Most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables. Therefore when they serve you with the small entree that they give you for meat it seems to always be filled with more vegetables then meat. When I request for them to try not to give me so much vegetables I'm told that I will have a smaller portion of food not more meat. I simply don't understand why you would rather argue with your customer then to satisfy them. Obviously this company has become so big that the quantity of food left in there trays is more important then the quality of service they are giving. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> \""Great Escape Lounge the\""? Seriously? Whoever addresses my junk mail must be posting business listings to Yelp now. \n\nQuestionable grammar aside, this place in a word, rocks. I want to lick the crusty underbody of its cracked, upholstered stools and have its dive bar babies. I'll wean those tough as nails tykes on a whiskey nipple and have them hustling gullible pool players by the age of six. Yeah, that's right. You just got beat by a baby that sound like a chain smoking grannie, bitch.\n\nPicture that visual. It isn't pretty. Neither is The Great Escape. \n\nHell you've probably driven by it half a dozen times and never even noticed it. Maybe your cocktail radar needs some fine tuning. I know all it takes is the illusion that booze can be had for me to veer left into a parking lot and saunter up to the bar, primal \""beer good\"" sense a-tingling. \n\nI realize I haven't told you jack about the place yet, but the faded stucco, dated sign and busted up jalopy in the parking lot should tell you all you need to know. This kind of ambiance can only be achieved through years of hard living in the fast lane and a general air of neglect. Play pool. Fire up the jukebox. Make an ass of yourself and do the chicken dance. Whatever gets your freaky rocks off. Just don't spill my drink.\n\nBring cash. Or be prepared to pound three drinks to meet their ten dollar requirement for opening a tab. Ten dollars for two beers and shot. What the eff are you still doing reading this!? It's Friday afternoon. Get off your ass and go check out a little dive square at the corner of Awesome Avenue and Rock Your Face Off Boulevard.\n\nYeah I might be a little drunk writing this review but do you want the triple distilled Erica, or do you want the burning raw power that only some backwoods firewater to the bloodstream can provide? I think we all know the answer to that one. All you have to do is be brave enough to turn to the bartender and say, slap me fast and rotten with the hoppiest stank you got. And make it a double. \n\nUgh, get some. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When my wife told me about some of her students in a music competition that was being held here - I was excited. I have never been, and besides it has to be cool right?\n\n\nWrong.\n\nThese kids played their heart out - tremendous talent. It was great, honestly refreshing - most of the bands were better than anything they play on the radio.\n\nThe venue - you know a place created by a musician? A place that has rock & roll memorabilia all over the walls - a restaurant supposed to celebrate music?\n\nComplete and total let down. Alice Cooper, you should be ashamed.\n\nThe venue didn't even bother to take the time to set up tables and chairs for the parents, teachers, and sponsor supporting them.\n\nThere was basically zero wait staff.\n\nAt least half the tables in the outdoor area (where the stage was set-up) were high-tops - which would have been fine - if there were chairs to go with them.\n\nInstead everyone was sitting in those El' Cheapo $5 green plastic lawn chairs. This not only was uncomfortable, but it negated the entire usefulness of the high top tables. \n\nAt least 4 times during the 2 hours I head the phrase \""Please tip well\"" and \""Please make sure you tip the wait staff well.\""\n\nThere was NO wait service - at all. You had to walk up to the counter and order. They had one poor employee trying to pick up all the empty cups/trash from a decent sized group of people.\n\nI would rather give my \""tip\"" money to the kids to buy more drum sticks guitar strings than give to a place that could care less about providing a comfortable place to watch talented kids play great music. Why would I tip people who did nothing to provide their services (you know...food?)\n\nThey had the top balcony section closed - I do not know why - our group would have loved to sit up there and hear the kids. But I guess when you have a whopping two or three tables to wait on inside (not related to the event, the place was a ghost town except for the people there to see the kids) it would be too much trouble to go up some stairs.\n\nIf they actually cared - and had staff there to support the event (3-4 waiters/waitresses would have been sufficient) they could have made some really good money off food sales.\n\n\nI certainly hope that in the future they secure somewhere that cares enough to at least properly set up the area for people to attend/sit. Heaven forbid the place actually function like a restaurant should and try to serve food/beverage.\n\nIt is a shame the rest of the competition is being held there. The kids deserve so much better. <|endoftext|>

I pulled off and remember these guys being here years ago so I came in to see if they can pull it off completely for me real quick...otherwise I would keep driving to find another shop, ha ha.  Anyhow the guy at the counter took a whole 5 minutes to take care of me and did not even charge!!!  I tipped him $20 for the help since I would have gladly paid what ever they wanted since I was in a rush to an appointment.  These guys were GREAT!!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A Pittsburgh classic.  Many, many late nights have I spent here, post strike party, or any other type party, eating the grease necessary to fight off the hangover I deserved the next day.  The waitresses are part of the ambiance.  Love their Reuben. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My boss says his body is a temple and won't eat anywhere else but Blue Fin.  So he took me there for my birthday.  So good...their salad has an amazing dressing (not sure what the taste is).  The ladies knew my boss and were very personable.  I go back often.  I get the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  Reasonably priced and the ladies are so sweet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect. \n\nI chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there, but I will say this after you have gone once you will never need to go back unless its late and you need something to soak up the alcohol. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've only been to La Grande Orange for pizza, but I plan to come back for breakfast or lunch some time soon since its so close to home. The pizza was pretty darn good, we ordered half gladiator and half fallen angel with all of the free add ons! This includes garlic, fresno peppers, onions and an egg!! The trick that one of the staff recommended to us (that we completely forgot yo do but will do next time) was to have the egg cooked over medium since they typically serve the egg sunny side up which can be too runny for most. I personally liked the gladiator more than the fallen angel. We also decided to go with a growler which you can decide to keep or just drink at the table (of course we decided to keep it for am extra $12). It is such a uniquely shaped growler! Super cute, reminds me of a genie bottle! The ambiance was very romantic with dim candle lighting and all of the staff was so friendly and helpful! I am so excited to go here for breakfast or lunch and check out the grocery store! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My last visit to Champaign treated me to some wonderful places to spend some quality time with friends. Murphy's Pub, The Blind Pig, and others. I would not put Esquire on that list.\nThe decor is uninteresting at best. There is no personality. It's designed to appeal to a crowd that just wants a nice bright place to hang out and drink.\nNot being a drinker, I can't rate the Esquire on that, but I can rate them on the food, and the food is so forgettable, I forgot to review it. Our group had a couple of burgers, some wings, and a chicken sandwich. I was told the burgers were good. The chicken must be avoided at all costs.\nThe sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun. I'm not entirely sure why, as this makes an awkward eating experience. The strips were nearly tasteless. Thank goodness for mayonaise. My wife had the wings. After one or two, she was trying to figure out why they didn't seem right. I was going to eat them, but I couldn't, and I LOVE wings. These things had enough salt to turn Lake Michigan into a salt lake. They were awful.  I would not go back at all. I'll eat diner food, fast food, and other kinds of food, but not Esquire Food. Meh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They get 1 star because less was not an option. Was told by someone at the hospital that the steak hoagies are great. Well either our opinions differ greatly on food or we just got hosed. Looked up the menu online. $9.00 for a lrg Angelo special. Think philly cheese steak. So I ordered 2 for myself and my gf. I asked for mine with well done peppers onions and mushrooms no lettuce or tomato. I get there and the total is over $24! So I ask why. I'm told \""oh yeah that's the owners fault he doesn't want to update the online website so it's a little out of date.\"" A LITTLE!?!?? Two and a half dollars more is not a little. So I leave already feeling taken but hey they are big and they feel heavy so I'm still optimistic. WRONG AGAIN! The sandwiches nearly fell out through the grease soaked bag and found my sandwich covered in grease swimming lettuce and tomatoes with pale mushrooms and uncooked peppers. Swimming I tell you swimming in grease! If I have a heart atack I'll know why. Called to complain and was pretty much told it was my fault they became greasy because I took to long to get there! And that its all the owners fault about the price. Poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership. The next thing that should be poor is the owner because I will NEVER eat there again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here for bruch and had their take on the classic eggs benedict.  I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and this was very good.  I opted for the prociuto as the meat option and I'm glad I did.  It gave the eggs enough flavor without having to add extra salt.  \n\nThe potatoes were perfectly cooked and the fruit was tasty as well.  Had the bellini and didn't realize how I much I would enjoy it so I had two! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was a bit hesitant to return.

He's got LOTS of energy.\n\nHad a carnitas chimichanga. Delicious, as always!\n\nLove the flour chips, and the hot salsa.\n\nI will be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One of the few US airports that I have encountered with toilet attendants.  This concept is ok, but the reality of it is that every time you go in one at Charlotte, you have the impression of being accosted by street vendors in a 3rd world country.   I'm not sure what their function is except to collect tips.  They don't put toilet paper in the stalls.  They don't clean urine off the toilet seats.  They only thing I saw them do was tear off a paper towel and hand it to me and then expect a tip.  If you don't leave a tip, then they are rude.  Get real Charlotte, pay your cleaning crew to clean the toilets and get rid of the bogus attendants.  I don't like to be accosted when I need to pee. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you're looking for straight-forward good Thai food then Thai Cuisine is the place to go. No frills, BYOB, no spa-like music simple Thai. It was quite good-I can't say it was an over the moon astounding, mind blowing, life changing experience, but it was good and what you want when you go for Thai food. \n\nMy husband had the spicy duck and it had good flavor, although more of a 5 than 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. Really good. \n\nI had spicy noodles chillin' at my standard 7 on the 1-10 scale. I can't complain. The noodles were great and the vegetables were deliciously cooked (I tend to go vegetarian). \n\nI will say the dumplings and spring rolls we had as appetizers were a notch above what we've had elsewhere in Pitt. \n\nWe will definitely go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't know where to start.  There were 3 of us for dinner Friday 3/8/13.  We arrived timely for our reservation, after requesting drinks, the waiter announced that he had \""never heard of  that\""; having tomato juice on the side of a martini.  Ok, moving on, Carl asked for blue cheese dressing, and our curmudgeon waiter's response was \""are you crazy, you are in an italian restaurant, not french\"" ?  How do you, as a customer, process this?  Next, the food came, salad, with the house dressing, awful and sweet, the mussels not fresh and the baked clams were good, however, complete with a piece of rock salt in the dish.  Off to a really bad start.  One special ordered piece of fish (frozen at best) and the shrimp scampi-greasy on a bed of fetuccini alfredo, and chicken piccata-looked like it was removed from the Delta business class kitchen, and tasted the same.  I must say, it would be hard to find a worse meal in Phx, anywhere for that matter, and this is one of the only times in my life that I left a 10% tip based on really rude service.  We almost left after the cocktail debacle, but foolishly stayed for the rest of the abuse to follow.  This place is way past its prime. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Was in the area and stopped in for. Cousin's used to be a regular lunch stop for me, but the three that I usually went to have closed over the last few years.\n\nThis one is barely acceptable. The place is dirty and the workers are apathetic. Either the whole chain has changed, or this place is below standards. I think that my sandwich had the absolute minimum of ingredients it could've. \n\nI'm not coming back. <|endoftext|>

I am usually impressed with their service and speed, but this particular Chipotle is the worst that I have ever been to and its unfortunately the closest to my house.  Their lines take forever, their employees are rude, they can never keep the food line stocked....I could go on and on.  I will drive out of my way just to not have to purchase from this store.  I have complained to Chipotle corporate about this store, however they seem to not yet have it figured out.  It needs new management. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's no wonder VCA has 5 stars they are amazing, we take our Dog Max there, he was rescued and was sick soon after we got him, they have taken such good care of him, have been more than helpful in faxing us his records adn nursing him back to health, if you are looking for a great Vet this is the place to go! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  what a wasted oppotunity.  \nNative American culture is so rich and the traditions so deep but they focus about 5 percent on this and 95 percent on being displaced and anger at reservation life and .. hold on.  dont bash.  i understand that they were wronged.  i am Japanese American and I KNOW what it is like to get land taken away and hearing stories about being a tax paying citizen and get taken to jail.  but ... i just wish the focus was on the beauty of the traditions and cultures.  i really wanted to take away more from it.  maybe i went in with expectations to high?  i live in hawaii so i see alot of ancient cultures and traditions and thought this place would be similiar.  and for 12 bucks a person to go there... at least parking was free! and there seems to be interactive things for kids too! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bad customer service.  I was on my third rescheduled appointment (the doctor had to reschedule); I show up to my 3rd rescheduled appointment only to be told the Nurse Practitioner was running 1 hour and 20 minutes behind.  I came from work to this appointment.  They could have picked up the phone to let me know!  \n\nI asked if since I lived up the street if I could come back in an hour and was  told \""no\"" they would take me back right away.  To do what?  Sit there naked in a gown for an hour and a half?  No thanks!  Will be going elsewhere from now on. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Village Green, I call it the VG for very good. If you want a good greasy burger, crispy golden fries, non-greasy crunchy cheese curds, a nice selection of local brews on tap and fast friendly service this place is for you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The place is good for drinking but definitely not to have a meal. There're not much options on the menu. \nI tried the pasta once and it was tasteless. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate this Safeway. I don't even think it's that ghetto, and I've never had a problem with things being out of stock. Even the prices are pretty good.\nThis is the closest grocery store to my house and I try to never shop there if I can help it. The reason? There are NEVER enough cashiers. I have never ever ever ever ever ever gone in and seen more than 2 cashiers working. Why do they even have 10 checkout lines if they're only going to use ONE most of the time? This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times. I once came here in the evening around 9 and stood in line for 40 minutes to pay for the one or two things I had bought. I couldn't believe it. That was over 2 years ago, and nothing has changed here, and you KNOW they get complaints about it, but they're obviously not changing anything.\nYou would be better off going to the Bashas or Safeway on 7th Ave & Osborn, or Fresh and Easy on 7th Ave and Indian School. Any time you would have saved driving to the closer grocery store would be more than lost standing in their outrageous checkout lines. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ok, I have been meaning to go here forever.  As a Jewish Girl, I like to know where to get Kosher stuff.\n\nI really did not know what to expect when arriving.  The store was smaller then I had expected, but carried a full line of items.  The meat case is where I hung out at most.  I decided to not get any meat here, as I was more just kind of getting an idea of what they carried more then anything else.\n\nThey also have a resturant here, but it was being revamped, so it wasnt really open.  I was kind of dissapointed, but its only temporary.  The staff here is small, but personable and will answer your questions if you should have any.  Please do not be intimidated when shopping here-its not just for us Jewish folks!! Its for everyone!\n\nI would return here in the future, but probably not on a regular weekly basis.  They have Challah, which I love, and one or two other things that I like to have around the house that are hard to find elsewhere around the Valley here at times.\n\nYou should also know that due to the Sabbath, the close early on Fridays, and are closed all day Saturday.  They are open Sundays though!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a nice place with ample amount of space to study, read, or just play around on the internet.  The establishment is full of great books, probably the biggest selection that I have seen since being a student at Appalachian State University.  If there is a line for the computers they only give you an hour to be online, but this is usually not a problem.  Everyone keeps pretty quiet and I would recommend it for studying or an afternoon read. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This Subway is very convenient to my work, which I love for getting a quick and healthy lunch.  It can get busy at lunch time, but even with about 8 people in front of me yesterday in line I only had to wait about 10 minutes.  Another plus is that even though they share a small parking lot with a lot of other businesses, there are always at least a few open spots. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Barb's Bakery...they epitomize what the local community feel is all about. It's like stopping by an old friend's house or having your childhood best friend's parents make you breakfast. They are extremely friendly, their prices are great, and their donuts are needed on a cheat day. You can't leave this place without a smile. Cheers to Barb's for doing things the right way. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Came here on a recent Sunday for lunch with some friends.  Our friends have been here many times and said that Little Shanghai is recently under new ownership.  They open at noon on Sunday and we arrived just after they opened, were the first customers of the day.  I am not sure the sign on the door indicates hours for Sunday??  Anyway, we received attentive and pleasant service.  All 4 of us enjoyed our meals.  \n\nWe ordered chicken egg fu young, lemon chicken, sweet & sour pork, and chicken w/ vegetables.  Most of the entrees were around $9 each and came w/ family-style white rice.  No lunch specials/combinations available for Sunday (maybe same for Saturday?).  Portions were large and we all ended up with take-home containers for another meal.  Overall I thought the food and experience was good.  I would like to try lunch special when they are offered, would be nice to see something like this on the weekend. \n\nThe waitress said they will be open through all the holidays including Xmas and New Year's.  Something to remember if you don't feel like cooking.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stayed at this hotel the second week of March 2014. A colleague and I both ended up with BED BUG BITES!! The hotel representatives we spoke with were rude and accusatory. They acted like we were trying to get away with something. REALLY?!? They refused to check our crews rooms for pests. They completely denied any responsibility and offered no help to us. I travel most of the year as my job requires. By far one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. I would post photos of the bites on my FACE, but being humiliated at work for a week was bad enough. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible customer service all the time. The liquor department manager who is at the counter in the morning takes a very long time for simple transactions. She frequently takes a long time and completely ignores the next person in line, not explaining what's happening, or acknowledging them. They don't open up other registers, they are not helpful when you ask for things. I hate having to go to this store. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not a large cultural center, but it does have several Asian shops and a large Asian gocery store. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is another one of my absolute favorites in AZ. I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.\n\nTortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.\n\nI love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.  \n\nI think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.\n\nSo they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.\n\nAs far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables. \n\nThey are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think. \n\nThey're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.\n\nI think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.\n\nRight now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.\n\nBTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. Ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been here twice and I'm just not crazy about it.  Nothing is BAD, per se, just not really impressive.  The service is fine and the food is certainly edible, but missing something - at least, their vegetarian food.  When I ordered sweet potato fries, a lot of them came out burnt.  The Big Green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks.  Their French onion soup was pretty good, but when is French onion soup not good?  They have a hot vegetarian sandwich, but it sounds gross.  Does hot hummus and alfalfa sprouts sound good to you?  As for non-vegetarian food, my dad was very satisfied with his hot grilled chicken salad.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back for brunch.  Since it's just around the corner from my new apartment, I'm sure I'll end up going here with my parents fairly often.  I'm not crazy about it, but if they're paying, I'm not opposed to it. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a great hospital for solving complex medical problems but security is a problem.  \n\nMy friend's iPad was stolen while she was sleeping in the middle of the night. \n\nAn iPad is a reasonable thing to bring to the hospital to pass the time.  It's not like she brought a diamond ring and left it lying around. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Looks like very other cvs. The store is the only reason they get two stars. Unfortunately I usually come here for the pharmacy. They are so slow and are not any help. If it wasn't for the convenience of it being next to my dr I would never come here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Greatest ice cream ever. If you are within 300 miles of Urbana-Champaign, take an unforgettable detour to Jarling's. You can thank me after you have swooned on two large scoops of their vanilla \""custard\""  ice creams topped with pecans, bananas  and fudge <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wham! 4 stars outta the park! The deep-dish pizza we had was amazing. I wasn't crazy about the avocado egg rolls, but the chocolate chip sundae was superb. Great service too from Maranda, a doll. Decor is cute. Ambience is lively. Recommended. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow.  I was the only one in line, and there were 5 people (all co-workers) sitting there chatting.  After I was ready to go at the register, it took another 3-4 minutes of waiting for them to finish chatting before I could get service.\n\nThere are way too many people that work here for the service.   At least the food was okay, although I have to say that it's not exactly \""fast food\"".  You might get better service at the Chilis Too in the same airport. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Their is nothing lower than one star or even negative. \n\nWhere to start? \nFOOD- NOT GOOD, the staff specially Miriam is SUPER NICE(GO TO THE DINNING ROOM, FIRST FLOOR)\nCLEANLINESS-Over the surface cleaning and the common areas, usually the first floor. Cover your nose if you go to the  second floor!\nCARE-2 girls (TOTALLY WORTH IT) out of at least 30 i have met. HORRID ODDS not to mention that they have 15-25 patients to 1 nurse. And they split patients from one wing to another on the other wing of the building. WHAT? Really! When I ask how my dad is doing; NO ONE KNOWS! It's usually a I just got here, or a plain \""I don't know\"". Don't they have charts? \nBATHS- Dogs gets better and more loving baths, I SAW it since I was in the bathroom/bath area. \nINJURIES: Just NEVER heals, goo on top of goo. \nACTIVITIES: I gotta give it to the lady in charge of that she does A TON if the residents want to join. \nOVERALL:\nThink about how you would want you mom or dad to be taken care off. And if you are a selfish person and you don't care about your parents. KARMA IS A B#&^!(@ So good luck when you get old! \nI sure know why I am not a Doctor, Economist, Mechanic, Arquitect to name a few... it's cause I SUCK! \nWhy choose to be in a field like this if you are not CUT for it? I am sure you can go somewhere else and make $10 an/hr! \nLooking for a different location currently! WHAT A SHAME this PLACE is OVERALL. \nThe 4 people i have met are not enough to make this location worth while anyones time! \nIf you want to get back at your parents, or a friend PUT them here! \nThey might keep them alive... BUT that's about it! Most of the people here are not terminal! They are just old, and have no one to look after them around the clock. They are here to have someone help them with basic needs and maybe show a bit of love while they are here. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My problem with Coup Des Tartes really is that the food is horribly overpriced...not moderately overpriced makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy place, but outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food. For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced. \n\n- Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish. \n- Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust.\n- Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25.\n- Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar. \n- Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil.\n- Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them.\n- Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic.\n- Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.\n\nI'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave. I cannot recommend Coup Des Tartes to anyone. The restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth, figuratively. With so many other nice, moderately overpriced restaurants with much better food, I don't know why anyone would come here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I LOVE Milio's. They're for sure my go to sub shop. The delivery range is kind of small so I've never been able to get delivery and can't attest to the speed of that. The pick up is always ready by the time I get there though. I can't remember a time where my order was messed up, but I can't say for certain it hasn't happened. If it has, it hasn't been often enough or much of a hassle.\n\nI used to go to Jimmy John's all the time and thought of Milio's as the lesser version. Man was I wrong. The quality here is much better. I love the bread. The perfect amount of soft insides and hard crust. Occasionally the end is a little harder than I like, but it's not too often. I really recommend getting the bread left in. I find not doing so to be a bit lacking. I can understand the other reviewer's complaints about it not being enough.\n\nThey also give you plenty of guacamole! I always feel like other places are a rip off with the amount they give.\n\nAlso try the cookies! I love the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut. They're always soft and fresh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I should know better than to eat seafood in a restaurant that is land locked. My friend and I decided to take advantage of a Groupon that i had purchased and roll it into a \""date night\"". He had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant. Our server was really nice and touted that they're known for their seafood, so of course I think, okay, let's order seafood. \nStarted off with raw oysters, not bad, I'm learning to like them and they had all the right sauces, no rogue shell pieces. Tasty. \nI had the stuffed shrimp, he had the almond crusted tilapia. The stuffed shrimp was way too salty and a little fishy. i think the shrimp was old or wasn't cleaned well. My mashed potatoes would have been great if they weren't so salty and the bacon that was supposedly there i could find. The tilapia was a complete opposite! no salt at all!. It was cooked fine, but needed some seasoning. Definitely their dishes were inconsistent. \nI have another groupon so i will try again, but i think the decision was to just order the steak and pasta instead. \nBeing a San Francisco resident i know i can't expect the seafood to compare, but i would have hoped that being in downtown Charlotte they would step it up a bit.\n....and almost forgot because they did, i had an open table reservation for points that they cancelled.  Now i'm unable to get the points on my reservation.  so unfortunate. <|endoftext|>

We have never had bad food here and we come here 2 - 3x/month. My husband loves the steaks. I usually order a variety of their seafood. We love the supper club effect with the veggies out first.  Salads are always fresh.  I recommend you try Toby's if you are not in a hurry.  They are just that good!  You will not be disappointed. Relax with one of their signature key lime martinis...better yet, make it two!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\nThe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \""serving off their orders\"" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband got me a gift certificate for a one-hour massage with Glenn.  I have to say, this was probably the BEST one-hour massage I've ever had.  When you go in, you fill out a sheet describing any problems you might be having, the amount of pressure you desire, etc.  If you're a first-time client, he'll have you fill out a questionnaire afterwards so you can offer any suggestions.  I'll definitely be referring Glenn to my friends and look forward to setting up my next appointment with him.  His prices are also VERY reasonable.  Also, he is located in Suite 501, not 518. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place has the absolute best food I've ever eaten, not just in the sushi category.  My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and both had the omikase. We both love sushi and both agree that this was hands down the best sushi and Japanese food we ever had. BUT, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the portion size. I was perfectly happy with the portion size but my boyfriend was not. I think the disappointment came more from his expectation of 7 courses of an American meal. I, however, was expecting portions smaller than the typical American meal. \n\nThe restaurant is pricey, but if you love sushi you have to go. The sauces perfectly complement the fish. The shrimp was absolutely perfectly cooked. The food itself is to die for and worth the price, just don't go expecting American size portions. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I realize that most people who need a phone usually don't check reviews on Yelp, but for those that do, stay away from this location. These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.\n\nAlso I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.\n\nI was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.\n\nIt's damn near a monopoly, but not quite. There's still Verizon and T-Mobile, and god forbid running a business with Cricket, which is a small step down from Sprint. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nice little cozy neighborhood market.  I was in the area and decided to drop by to check out what was fresh and get a drink.  From reading the other reviews I would've love to try their pizza.  The place reminds me of Dean & Deluca in a smaller package.  I usually don't eat sushi from markets but even their sushi looked appetizing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered pictures through the online photo center and requested them to be printed and picked up from this location. I selected and paid extra for same day prints and were told online that they'd be ready in 1-3 hours. I went to pick them up several hours later and the guy behind the counter couldn't find my photos. He said, \""Oh, it must be because our printer is out of ink, we should have your prints on Friday or Saturday\"" This is Wednesday, I need them today! If I wanted them in 4 days I would have paid $10 less! I asked for them to send my file to another location so that they could be printed there. No such luck, they said they were not able to do that. Now I have to upload, size and crop all of my photos again and reorder them to be picked up from another store. If they would have just called me this morning and told me the problem, I would have my pictures in time. Now, it's far too late for any Rite Aid to print my photos tonight. Come on people, communicate with your customers! Thanks for nothing!\n\nGo to the Baum location. It's just around the corner and far nicer inside. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Phoenix Zoo employee Brandon (white male in his 20s). who was working the front gate called me a Dick. \n\nYou are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. \nMy mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.\nWe got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)\nWhen I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.\n(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; \""maybe you should learn how to say no.\"" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said \""Maybe you should mind your own business.\"" Then I turned around again and heard; \""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick.\"" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said \""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.\""\nHe looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said \""No.\"" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. \nI explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!\nI've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said \""you don't have to explain that to me...\"" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said \""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. \""\nWhen I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???\nSo I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.\nI was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.\n\nUpdate to this review:\nI called the Zoo Tuesday morning and left a message for Jennifer which is Janelles supervisor but she never called me back, so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Out of 5:\n3.5 - Burger: The first several times I came here, it was terribly overcooked and dry.  Then, all of a sudden, their quality and consistency of cooking went up significantly.  While it lacks in seasoning, getting them to sprinkle on some salt and pepper while they cook it works wonders.  \n3.0 - Cajun Burger: Now that's some seasoning.  A bit strong and salty but good every once in a while.\n1.5 - Home Fries\n2.5 - Red Skin Potatoes: glad to see some slightly healthier yet not too healthy side dishes here.  Though with the melted butter...\n3.0 - Beef Ribs\n0.5 - swordfish: dry and tough\n2.5 - tuna\n\n1.5 - Service: Can be quite bad a lot of the times, probably because of how busy they are.\n2.0 - Value <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I agree with the previous two reviewers. I've shown up here 5 times for breakfast after my 10 AM class ~around 10:53... every time except for once when they had a pretty reasonable employee, the people here have come up with some lame excuse to avoid making me a breakfast sub. (Breakfast subs are available from 7-11)\n\nSilvermine next door is so much better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I do not have much to say about this place other than the food is horrible.\n\nthe people are nice but the food is horrible if you are itialian and the cook is not even itialian.\n\nstay away if you want real itialian food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OMG! Avoid this place at all cost! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you're new to Charlotte and still adjusting to living in the New South, go to Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown. I can pretty much guarantee that the macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, biscuits, meatloaf and all the other soul food will remind you why Charlotte is a good place to live. \n\nYou can order food from Mert's online, which is a convenient perk. I've been to a couple events catered by Mert's. Mm mm. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really didn't care for the breakfast steak biscuits.  The meat patty was coated and then deep fried.  It was impossible to tell what type of meat it was.  Eating it between the biscuits....it was like oil on oil.  The biscuit itself was ok.  But I would not go there for breakfast. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yawn.\n\nI've eaten 2 meals at mortons and honestly - I can do better at home. Sure the food was good - but dropping $100+ dollars and not being thoroughly impressed isn't my idea of great value.\n\nSave you're $ go buy a steak and a $20 bottle of wine at the Harris Teeter and fire up your grill - you'll pay 30 bucks and have just as good of a meal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First off, we WILL return.  This place is pretty solid on humble authentic atmosphere and recipe/presentation.  It is obviously a favorite of the Japanese-American population of Charlotte!\n\nAfter many good Yelpers guided us to this spot, we decided finally to give it a try.  A busy spot and a small restaurant.  It did not appear that they took reservations; I'm not sure.  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six.  Dress in layers; this tiny joint gets cozy.\n\nWe plan to try more sushi varieties; it's right in line with prices from other places.  It's very fresh, straightforward presentation.  Timing on food coming out is decent; we didn't wait forever.  We had a couple of rolls and they were good.  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive.  My $11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting.  Next time I will probably try a bento box.  My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and was pretty satisfied.\n\nThe service staff is so very nice and cheerful.  If you know Japanese (my husband does) they love to make conversation. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> La Salsitas...32nd St & Indian School. This is hands down some of the best Mexican food in the Valley. A quiet little place minding their own business doing what they know how to do. This is a must-visit quaint restaurant. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place to hit. Totally Six Stars...this place gets Best Mex In The 'Hood!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Need better phone service attempted to place a call-in order but didn't get anyone to answer after calling 2-3 times, pathetic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say \""I love fioris\"" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Oy! Sensory overload.  Be careful or you might hurt yourself trying not to pass out from all the yummy choices or destroy your budget after you discover this place~ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good food , excellent service from the hostess to the waiters! Attentive ,friendly ,quality, cleanliness a+ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The place is small but, I see it as cozy. There is also outside seating that is great to enjoy on a beautiful day or evening. \n\nThe owner waited on me. And made me the best Viennese Mocha, I \nthink is possible. Excellent to the last drop! I learned they roast and blend their own beans. Well someone here knows what they are doing because this was the smoothest coffee drink at a coffeehouse I think I have yet to have. And hey ... I lived in Seattle for almost twenty years I have been to some coffeehouses, let me tell ya! \n\nI went to their website www.GrindersCoffeeCo.com \nIt's a great little website. It explains the place well  ,as well as their coffee and I also learned they have a rotating art showing on the walls that change the 1st Saturday of each month and jazz or  blues playing on the patio the 2nd Saturday of each month. \n\nI might just be there for this first Music night in 2010. Say Hi if you see me around there getting my caffeine buzz on anytime.\nI'll try it again before I give them a five star rating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a horrible place, but certainly not good.\n\nI landed in one concourse of the A terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  I walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  Unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse I found there to be very limited options.  This I cannot understand.  Both concourses had a similar number of gates, yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  Of course by the time i walked to my departure gate I did not have time to wander back to the other concourse, so I settled for a lesser option near my gate.\n\nJust hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  Either requires a bus trip.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  At least you do not have to take a train like in Atlanta or Denver.\n\nThe last issue I will cover in this review is the fact that Southwest and US Airways hold most of the spots at this airport.  That is enough reason not to fly here. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The kobe beef burger was probably the best burger I've EVER had. It was so tender and juicy. I'm not a huge burger fan, but even my dad, who could eat a burger for every meal agreed with me on this one.\n\nReally, everything I've tried there is very delicious and the food comes out fast and the service is super nice. Unlke \""Nifty C.\"" I actually really liked that you can see the guys cooking in the kitchen. Yes, it's a little dim in there, but I just think the setting makes the atmosphere a bit more casual and intimate. It definitely lacks any decor and the tables and chairs are uber simple, but if you can get past that and you just want good food, this place is a great spot! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \n\nAdvice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK-I realize this should not be a surprise.  But, in a stupor of holiday exhaustion, I ordered a Pan-Normous pizza for me and my kids.  My children, apparently already slaves to advertising, REALLY wanted to try it.  It turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on TV, versus real life.  ( I am sure there is a deep life lesson here, but I was too irritated to take advantage of it)  There was nothing enormous about the pizza, which is my main complaint.  I asked the guy on the phone how many people it would feed, he said 8.  Ummm-8 tiny people.  It was also, not good, but again, not surpised at that.  So I think I will be thankful that now my kids know how gross Pizza Hut is too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I also would never step inside a Walmart but could not resist the $99 iPhone sale. I'll give them one star as most people seemed well intended. But I was amazed at how poor the service was. It took almost 45 minutes to purchase a phone because the manager helping us didn't have authority to log in to the main computer. The store was severely understaffed. Several workers had their shirts half tucked in. Their walkies on blast. Workers yelling down aisles. Zero sense of urgency to complete a sale. Our salesperson repeatedly shared that he hated the iPhone (that I was intending to purchase). I could never imagine this conversation at Best Buy. \n\nI wasn't going to report this ridiculously awful experience because, again, the man helping me meant well. I place 100% of the blame on upper level management not trusting their staff, poor training, not investing in their staff's well being & not passing on authority to put customers first. \n\nWhen I purchased my iPhone, I asked that the terms of my data plan not be altered. They assured me several times that it would not. When I got home, I learned that actually they had changed my plan and it took two days of speaking with AT&T to revert back (my plan is amazing and no longer offered). After the unnecessary headache of getting my plan reinstated, I thought it important to leave a review. \n\nI'm very happy with my phone, certainly at this price, but if at all possible stay far away from this store. At least until Walmart starts training and supporting their staff properly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  But the rating goes mainly for the staff. Been with the office close to 10 years, due to past good experiences even fired my specialists and relyed on Dr James and wife Dr Jacqueline Doris for my care.\nMissing test results from labwork dated 10-15-12 are however a bone of contentment with the staff, especially the office manager, who takes quieries through my electronic chart access as an insult(?). Is asking for the test results- all test results- not my patient right? should I not have been advised on later appointments what the results are?\nIf i had some ungodly illness, shouldn't I be informed to keep the rest of the world uninfected?? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible customer service!  Strangely rude and condescending.  I confronted them about their attitude, which was unnecessary.  I know when poor service is justified as I've been in the industry and given it myself!  It was unjustified and quite odd, actually.  \n\nWe politely (key word) asked where a few of the ingredients were that the menu listed for our meal and that's when they became defensive and quite weird about it. Strangely rude and almost demeaning, saying it was a waste to send it back.  \n\nThe pizza was slopped together the first AND the second time, and I don't even trust what they did to it in the kitchen.  Yes, this is the feel I got from them, being our server, Zach and the other man whom I believe to be the bartender or the manager.   \n\nWe were running a pretty high drink bill and there was no need for the negative energy. It ruined our experience and vibe of the place.  Over a pizza?  Poor service, poor choices. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he \""only gets a complaint once every 2 months\"" and that he has a \""packed house.\"" He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said \""whatever\"" and left, shortly returning with our refund.\nFood:\n-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty\n-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned\n-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture\n-Bolognese-no flavor\n\nBottom line:\n-Rude, arrogant owner\n-Bland,over-priced food\n-Never returning!!\n\nI really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hate this bar. The only good time to go is when it's nearly empty. As soon as people start really piling in, the lines get too long, the bartenders turn into assholes who play favorites, and the douchiest douchebags fill Brothers shoulder-to-shoulder. I don't get why people go here just for the wings. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I only want three things from a transit system:\n\n1. To get from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time (less than an hour if in city limits) and in reasonable comfort.\n2.  Reliable service.  If the schedule says a bus will arrive at a particular time, then the bus will arrive within about five minutes of that time.  If the schedule says buses arrive every 10 minutes, on average, then I expect to wait no more than about 15 minutes.\n3.  Affordable fares and passes.  Because price is one of the only areas in which public transit has the potential to be directly and immediately more convenient to a person than individual car ownership, prices to passengers should be kept to a minimum. \n\nBefore moving here, I heard all sorts of trash talk about Port Authority, but really, it's a decent transit system.  I use it to travel to and from all three of my jobs, and I have yet to be late because of the bus.  As such, Port Authority easily meets my first two transit requirements.  As for price, I miss San Francisco's $45 Fast Pass, but I'm willing to pay a premium for the reliability that Muni couldn't offer.  Still, $75 for a Zone 1 pass is a LOT of money when you're paid minimum wage--which I'm sure is the case for many passengers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to \""add on\"" something in a pushy way. \n\nI asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his \""Best In City\"" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?\n\nDon't bother with this place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We sat down and waited forever, no one even addressed us. It was not busy so there's no reason for them to have such horrible service. Don't go here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What happened to this place? I used to go here quite often, but I am thinking twice before returning. I waited to update this review until I had 3 negative experiences because I wanted to give Zoe's the benefit of the doubt, but things have not improved. First off, there has been water covering the floor of the left side of the restaurant the past 3 times I have been there. I think they have a leaky roof, but it has been weeks, maybe even months, and there is still water. This is hazardous and just plain disgusting. Also, the restaurant is just dirty. I had to ask to have 2 different tables wiped down, and the crumbs from the table were wiped onto the chairs. There were 5 of us in for lunch last week, and every chair was covered in crumbs from the previous diners. So gross! I am sad this place has gone downhill; Zoe's has always been a staple for my friends and me, and now we will have to find a replacement. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I and our son love this restaurant. Once you have Chinese food here you will select this as your top Chinese restaurant. Everyone is so friendly, the service is excellent and the food always comes nice and hot. They also have some excellent Thai specialties. I recommend the KieWan if you like Thai dishes. The amazing chicken will keep you coming back time and time again.  I cannot recommend this place enough; try it and I bet you agree. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> the gf and I came to eat here a couple of days ago and loved it. The entrees were excellent as well as the escargot appetizer. Service (Eric?) was great as well. The only thing that was average was their fried calamari. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  ribs were dry, hardly any meat on them, and chewy/tough. seems that management may have changed since I last visited many years ago. man at counter lacked appreciation for my business, made crude comments about women who had just left,  and was very impersonal, did not thank me for my business or even look at me when he handed my to go order to me. I doubt I'll ever return to this location. the one on central I may try once more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place uses to be about us members but now they are no better then the big banks out there. They will hit you up with fees and even charge a monthly membership fee!  Barf! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Inner Peaks is THE place to climb in Charlotte. The staff is excellent and is the climbing community! They are always trying to make the facility better for new and seasoned climbers alike! \n\nNever been climbing before? Don't fret! The staff at Inner Peaks will take good care of you. There is a short orientation video, tour, and training to make you feel comfortable. The have rental gear to make sure you have everything you need. Just wear comfy/athletic clothes. \n\nSeasoned climber? There are 2 top-out boulders, bouldering walls, lead cave, and plenty of top ropes to suit your needs. There is also a workout area and climbing training area. \n\nPro tips: Mondays are 1/2 price day passes for guests climbing with a member. Wednesdays are college days. Discounted day pass and gear rental with a college ID. There is also a great Power Flow yoga class offered on Wednesdays (included with the price of admission).\n\nSecond location coming to the SouthEnd in 2015! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  How does this place have good reviews? I have apartments and Kirch is the only game in town when it comes to used appliances which keeps me coming back; but I'm annoyed I did every time. \nI have purchased 2 refurbished coin op washers here, both died in less than a year. \nI have purchased about 8 stoves or refrigerators, each time they try to charge to remove the old one. Each time I refuse and they always take it for free, because they are going to fix and sell it.  \nI called them recently for a stove repair. I told the guy on the phone exactly what the error code is. They made an appointment to come fix it; they did not fix it and instead just told me the error code. Duh, that's why I called and that's what I told you. First the guy said they would have to order the part and come back. Then a day later some other guy called claiming the manufacturer recommends not repairing when this part is needed.  It's a $50 part and they are flat out lying hoping to sell me a used stove while taking one back to the shop at the same time.  I've had enough, the difference between a used stove/fridge/washer and a new one is not enough to put up with these good old boys - just go to Sears or someone like that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So the Boar, as we affectionately call it. It's good for a lot of things. Darts, pool, Tuesday blues night (live blues band!), fun times, decent beer, waffle fries, and fried cheese curds (if you don't mind the sort that come from the freezer). The food? Not so great. It's not so bad, but it's just not that good.\n\nI think everything is frozen at this place. Everything. We had pizza there the other night and I could taste the freezer burn. We still had a blast, but it would be nice if the food wasn't so obviously frozen. Everything is ordered from the bar, which is fine but a little weird.\n\nThere isn't too much to say about this place other than what I've just said. I'll go back because my friends at work like it, but it wouldn't be my top choice. There are definitely other places that can fill my dart needs while providing me with at least decent, non-frozen food.\n\nSorry, Boar - the truth can hurt. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> CLASSIC BBQ JOINT !!!!!!\n\nWhat a great place to get REAL BBQ !! The family owned and run aspect always appeals to me, and the casualness is pure downhome. This place reminds me of the authentic bbq joints in MPLS and St Paul MN, my hometown.\nThe pulled pork sand was as good as any as I have ever had, and the sides were unique. Just eating something called \""CowBro Beans\"" is an experience. \nIt maybe could be a little cleaner, but so could Famous Dave's.\nWorth the time and money. Don't miss out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went to Umi last night on a first date.  The wine was delicious, had two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and ordered 4 rolls to share.  Spicy Tuna was delicious, there was no spicy mayo, but it didn't even need it.  The spicy softshell crab roll was amazing and i stuffed it into my mouth as usual because its a larger sized sushi.  The most delicious was the Eel and cucumber roll.  The other was the green fuji, this was different and delicious.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate covered pretzel and it was out of this world.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate salty pretzel rounds stacked on top of each other with caramel drizzled over the entire thing.  I'd go back just for dessert.  I'd also like to try some entrees but we were there just for sushi.\n\nWill definitely go again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great atmosphere, unfortunately no parking , like in most uptown. place is ideal for smokers , now that smoking has been prohibited everywhere, you can smoke inside by the bar or in the luxurious leather  chairs with a tasty beverage.  Con: Their bartender is a little snobby. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped in for the first time not having known for 10 years that we were neighbors.  I'll start with the fact that the owner/operator was extremely polite greeting you when you enter and welcoming you.  I had my 2 toddlers in tow, and this can be intimidating to most small shop owners knowing one bad move can cause chaos from a toddler.  We sat down ordered some meals, lamb gyro, chicken ka-bob sandwich, hummus.  Easy mediteranean meal almost imposible to mess it up.  We walked in at opening so it took 10 minutes or so for food, but the array of goods in the market to shop made the time fly.  With no prompting they took it upon them selves to split the gyru meal for my kids, which was awesome and a super time saver for me.  The flat bread pita was good more authentic to the chew than the buttery mall version (though I like both).  The meat was perfect the lamb tender with a nice sear on it, very generous thickness as well preserving the meat texture.  their tatziki was a chunky version with great flavor and a crisp cucumber crunch through-out very refreshing in the 100+ degree lunch temps we were having.  The chicken was good with a nice subtle flavor and plenty of juice left inside the well grilled meat.  \nThe hummus was traditional and very smooth more dip than spread.  \nOverall I am super impressed, the market has every canned and jarred good you could imagine from SPAM to stuffed Olive leaves and all stops in between.  The deli counter had a simple variety of olives and various feta cheeses, their produce was depleted (possibly because I walked in as they unlocked the doors) or not stocked yet.  I will be returning to shop and to eat again.  The welcoming owner made me feel as though my children will also be dining there regularly.  I will try to work my way through their menu board over the coming weeks, and will try to report back. <|endoftext|>

This would be my choice for a \""last meal\""  I challenge anyone to give me a better spot than this,and please do not say Carolinas because I will hunt you down and slap a B*#+* <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After repeatedly trying to contact Pam following her response I received no effort of a reply. Both times I spoke to Donna and either she did not pass on my message or Pam choose to not respond. Either way, my previous post seems to be justified. Following frequent incorrect pieces of information provided from the staff (and some outright lies) I have no choice but say STAY AWAY FROM ARCADIA COVE!! \n\nThe costs are going up and the staff is becoming more impossible to work with, Specifically Donna who feels no need to follow through on anything her staff says to the residents. Obviously Pam is not regularly available for anything other than writing phony concerns on Yelp. \n\nRecent increased fees and changes in policies without proper notice (dating notifications up to 2 weeks prior to actually delivering them) are out of control and somehow legal through manipulations of information provided in the lease. \n\nThis property has become and absolute disaster. I recommend looking anywhere that is NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MEB!!!\n\nAlso - DO NOT read their website reviews - they only put up reviews that recommend the complex and completely disregard all others. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would NEVER suggest that anyone shop for a used vehicle at this Ford dealership.  The used car Sales Manager is lacking character and integrity.  They had a vehicle priced online right at the price we were looking for so we went in to see the vehicle.  It was a very basic, no feature vehicle for a college student.  Once we agreed to purchase it, they came out with a price $1000 higher than what was listed.  The Sales Manager came out and tried to make excuses for a 3rd party company that posts their sales ads and that it was their mistake...we told him it wasn't our issue.  He then proceeded to LIE to us about the costs they put into the vehicle...since they would never put into it more than what it's worth.  This man should not be in the position he's in, as they could have easily made up for their $1K mistake just in the day and should have honored the price they advertised...and to sit and lie to our face?  Get some integrity loser! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I ate here this past weekend with my husband and a large group of friends. Although they don't take reservations (at least not this weekend, maybe because of the holiday) our party of 11 was sat together rather quickly at 8:30. Most of us got the Gourmet Cheeseburger and it was delicious! The burger was huge! It was juicy and full of flavor. I had mine topped with blue cheese, along with the onions and mushrooms. I chose to get the chips as my side and they were not homemade, something I was hoping for since all the other food was of such high quality. Our waitress was a bit scatterbrained and when she brought our food out, had no idea who got what and kept insisting the plates were right even though we each remembered what we got. Other than that, it was a great experience and I would definitly go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife (the quilter) and I found this place busy on a Monday about closing time.  \n\nGreat selection of fabric with good samples to the point the space was a little crowded.  \n\nLots of notions and patterns with precuts available including 1/2 yard cuts.  \n\nPrices on the high side.\n\nStaff helpful.\n\nAs the husband I did not see a place for husbands to sit and no restroom in site. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The obvious choice for GSLIS students and staff; we're heavily caffeinated. Good place to grab some coffee between classes. 95% of the staff is wonderful and very friendly, just a pleasure to interact with. However, there is one older gentleman there, I'm not sure if he's the owner or not, but he is exceedingly rude. Unless I am really pressed for time, I will make the half-mile trek to Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and i went to Coup De Tartes for our second anniversary and we weren't disappointed.  We were seated outside and created a nice atmosphere with the lights and the fountain, perfect for our evening. I would probably only want to sit outside unless it was super hot.\n\nThe service was very good. Our server was very attentive.\n\nAs for the food, it was very excellent! My steak was really good. My plate also had mashed potatoes and spinach.  I just wish I had more when I was done, but was quite full after the meal and some bread beforehand.\n\nMY wife had the house special of the evening-halibut and said it was one best good fish she's had.\n\nWe ended the evening with dessert. I was only going to have a bite or two, but after my first bite of the berry tart, I changed my mind and ended up eating more, much to the chagrin of my wife.\n\nThe only downside is parking. There is only a selected amount of spots.\n\nMake sure to make reservations and bring your own wine/beer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.\n\nThe entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \""fancy\"" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.\n\nThis place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love PCG! It has to be my favorite restaurant, aside from Houston's. The brie appetizer is soooo yummy. And last week I tried the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich. It was sooo good. The bacon wrapped shrimp is good, but after two, you feel a little weighed down. It had some type of white cheese in it- not necessary. I shouldn't have tried it anyway- I am trying to be a fishetarian. They have great simple salads. And the cedar plank salmon is absolutely my favorite menu item. mmmmm..... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great looking place, expected a really classy experience.  What we got was a waitress who didn't introduce herself or greet us, clear our plates or fill our drinks.  What we also got was food that would have been just slightly above average had it actually been hot.  The food was lukewarm, refried beans had a burned taste, chips were stale, the fried ice cream was obviously fried a few days ago so it pretty much just looked like a big ball of ice cream that had been rolled in cornflakes.  Not to mention we didn't get the extra garnishes the table next to us got.  We won't be going back, there are way too many other places that are worth the money. <|endoftext|>

No significant waiting.  Painless needle sticks.  Wonderful volunteers.   While it took a very long time to finally get into the system, so far I have nothing but good things to say about the staff and service.   The VA here serves a huge population and seems to be very considerate of patient needs.  Thanks guys for your care and attention. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I were out and about and like so many pregnant women, with only a couple weeks left to go, I found myself with the sudden urge to use the bathroom. We stopped into a Starbucks on 7th ave and Camelback in Phoenix and noticed that they had keypad locks on the bathroom doors. I waddled up to the counter and asked the barista if I could please have the code for the ladies room. He asked if I was going to buy something because he could only give me the code if I made a purchase. I replied that I'm pregnant and need to use the bathroom now. He again repeated that I would have to purchase something. I glared at him and walked away to my husband and told him that I was denied access.\n\nUnderstandably, this upset Brad who marched right over to the Starbucks employee and in a forceful tone again stated that I am pregnant and should be granted use of the bathroom. They went back and forth for a moment, all the while the employee repeating that toilet access comes with a purchase. Finally Brad put his credit card on the counter and said, \""Charge me for whatever and give me the code!\"". To this, the barista said no and refused to sell him anything, insisting instead that we leave and go to the Fry's down the street and use their facilities. \n\nA woman in line behind Brad who had been witnessing this bathroom denial insanity said that she was about to be making a purchase and asked for the code. The unrelenting employee refused and instead told my husband that if he didn't leave, he would be calling the police.\n\nAt this point, Brad realized that my urge was becoming urgent so we left and used the bathroom at a much more accepting Subway next door. \n\nI don't know if there is any civil or federal code that permits access of a toilet to a pregnant women in the state of Arizona, but there should be extenuating circumstances regardless. Especially when there is no signage stating that the bathrooms are for customers only.\n\nI have never experience anything like this in my life. To unapologetically deny a very pregnant woman the use of a bathroom is wrong. This male barista exhibited a total lack of compassion and understanding, not to mention zero common scence. I hope that other pregnant women never have to experience this kind of embarrassment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It has come to my attention that I have not reviewed Rokerij. Clearly this is a travesty of justice so I'm here to make things right in the world. I've been to Rokerij twice now and both times left fat and happy. and buzzed. \n\nI dined at Rokerij on Sunday evening; it was a \""Saves the Day\"" moment because the first choice restaurant fell through and Dottsy was starving and reaching for my throat. We booked it to Rokerij and sat at the sexy copper bar, ready to partake in some small plate action. As everyone has mentioned, the happy hour deals are for the bar only, between 4-6PM. They are running a new wine promotion too: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, all bottles are 50% off. Yay! I ordered all the seafood plates: mushrooms stuffed with crab, ceviche, ahi tuna w/ wasabi, and crab tostadas. With the Long Boat Sauvignon Blanc in hand I was in heaven. \n\nI like that the bar is dark and cozy, though I noticed a light was actually out above me, making it near impossible to see my menu. The Happy Hour deal rocks, but it does make me sad not to be able to sit in those comfy leather chairs by the fire sipping wine and stuffing my face on ultra-cheap eats. \n\nRokerij is a solid performer, and probably deserves that 5th star, but I'm holding off until I finally dine in the main restaurant and enjoy one of their delicious sounding entrees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In the wake of the CMYE@PCG there formed a rebel band of Yelp mercenaries on the hunt for karaoke: there was the leader, Tiffany B, with an enchanted blackberry map fueled by starlight and charisma she pooled together her powers of navigation and tied her curly locks back in anticipation of the voyage to come. There was her first Lt. Dante M with a fearlessness that bordered on the reckless, his was a stalwart courage feuled mostly by alcohol and brazen contempt for authority. There were the Brothers C, Ryan and Daren, two exemplary soldiers of fortune whose fame/infamy had become a thing of legend. There was Dolores G, the champion and primary breadwinner of the ensemble.  There was Chris B, a beserker, tenor, and master crafstman. And finally there was Robert O, perhaps the most enigmatic and mysterious figure of the group he stood on the precipice of reality and greatness. Some would deem him a young Hemmingway, or a more talented Ryan Seacrest- at any rate his presence lent creedence and semblance to a group whose sole purpose was to butcher pop songs at the seediest bar they could find.\nTheir journey first took them down the long and winding paths of 16th st, to a charming but treachorous haven of filth that belonged to Phil, upon arrival it was evident their Karaoke treasures were not to be found here. Onward their travels took them to their final destination- Pat Murpheys house of sin/shame on 32nd st and Thomas.\nThe drinks flowed, the songs were sung, Hearts were broken microphones were dropped, and Cowboy was on the top of his game (a sagacious old fool whose coolness rivaled the marlboro man) spinning his cowboy hat in the parking lot like a whirling dervish. cowboy had a wisdom and charm that is unmatched. As the night dragged on and the songs became more desperate, I found my drunk to be wavering and my wallet to be in want of funds, i said my goodbyes and took my leave of the company and wandered into the night whence i'd came. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start off by saying I love GOOD Italian food, thus the reason it's been several years since my last visit here. I was asked to give them another try by 2 fellow foodies, mainly because they made the signature bread pudding sound so good and there was a $20 certificate for $5 on juice in the city.....that is the only reason I returned after all this time. I'm not sure how this place has been here as long as they have, I mean let's be honest.....the food is sub par. Again, I am a lover of Italian food and if your signature rigatoni with meat sauce can't even compete with stouffer's.....that's a problem. I mean the noodles were hard and chewy, the sauce was salty and the bread was tasteless....this is a basic Italian dish which I would think could never be screwed up........geez! The penne alla vodka was also full of salt with hard and chewy noodles......glad I only paid $5 bucks! The bread pudding, which is not on the menu, gave me something to smile about after a bad meal.......It was covered in caramel sauce I think and served with ice cream.......very good...........to bad they're not a dessert bar. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sushi Kim has long held a reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in town. However, after repeated visits, I wonder if this stems from the day when Sushi Kim was practically the only sushi restaurant in town. \n\nPlease note that this review pertains to the sushi dining only, for dinner. I've not been there for lunch or had the Korean food.\n\nMy most recent visit typifies each time I've had there. Upon arrival, the place is nearly empty. The service is attentive but indifferent, as if they realize you're a dirty dish that needs to be cleaned - you're taken care of like any other chore.\n\nThe miso soup arrived, and was very tasty. However, it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool. This is pretty normal, as well. \n\nThe most disappointing part is the sushi itself. It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar. Each and every variety is equally disappointing, with the end result being \""Meh\"" to \""Yech.\"" \n\nWith such a large population of sushi places in Pittsburgh these days, and even Giant Eagle in a pinch, there is not really a reason to frequent this place anymore. After a handful of visits based on reputation and the hope that this time might be better, I've made my last trip to Sushi Kim. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I want Tom's to be better... but it isn't.  The place has a cool \""Cheers\"" vibe, the service is excellent, but...\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese.  The simplest thing on the menu, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThose of you who are grilled cheese experts, like I am** will understand when I say: there was no butter on the bread and there was only one paltry slice of american cheese.  Seriously.  At least give me some cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.  It's even in the title!\n\nI am sure that Tom's has more options for non-carnivores on their huge menu, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to peruse the menu at length or concoct a special order.\n\nThe worst part?  My sub-par grilled cheese, fries, and iced tea came to $12!!!  Come on!  They put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast!\n\nAt least the service was good.\n\n**side note: I really wish more restaurants would get on the options for vegetarians bandwagon.  No, I do not want iceberg lettuce on a plate with italian dressing, thank you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I like. I don't get over here that often, but when I do, I always have a good meal. With restaurants that vary their spice levels according to your taste, it's always nice when you find one where your medium hot corresponds to their medium hot and so on. Too many times I've ordered 4/5 for spicy and gotten a 2/5 of 6/5 (yes, that's a thing that can happen). Their naan is delicious, always served hot and fresh baked. The Madras Shrimp are great if you can take the heat, if not, the butter chicken is everything butter chicken should be. Mango kulfi for dessert! Or gulab jamun, as fun to say as it is to eat. <|endoftext|>

I enjoyed my stay, though I was exhausted from a day at the airport and two return trips to the gate on a plane with mechanical issues. \n\nThe employees were very friendly.  The rooms are nice -- kitchenette with fridge, 2-eye stove, sink, moderately-supplied cabinets and coffee maker. The flat screen TV is HUGE -- great for watching some Monday Night Football. It also rotates around toward the bed, which was very comfy. \n\nA few local restaurants deliver to this Residence Inn, so as the front desk for the menus if you don't want the hotel's room service. \n\nTheir shuttle runs to the airport every 30 minutes, and they were ready for me at 4 a.m. with a very happy driver...way happy for that time of the morning, but it was most welcome... \n\nI wish their basket of goodies in the room had more than popcorn, and that they had more goodies for sale downstairs. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location, it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night, but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced, with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent, it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. <|endoftext|>

Yummers!!\n\nAlso had a muffin of some sort... I think it was like blueberry white chocolate. Super yummy!\n\nNote: The place isnt all that big and its crammed with stuff.

But since I was already there I decided to stop in and much to my surprise there was a solid vending machine next to the restrooms.. The $5 cover seemed a little steep just to peruse the vending machine selection... The young ladies working  the establishment seemed to be enjoying the surroundings.. A dimly lit ambiance in which to enjoy a \""Big Hunk.\"" Music bumping, fists pumping, and scantily clad women swinging around the red vines flashing their skittles around freely for the taking. Decided to leave a short time afterwards, before I was tempted to get a Milky Way. Top notch establishment, will visit again! Probably going to need another dentist visit after satisfying that sweet tooth. <|endoftext|>

I adore their clam chowder (white), and just about everything else on the menu. That have a fantastic fish selection with several fresh catches to choose from. The scallops are wonderful, and the shrimp is sooooo fresh.\n\nThe staff is super friendly. The manager let my daughters pet the lobsters (in fact, he invited them to do so).\n\nTwo thumbs up! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Store review:\nIn my short time in Champaign, I still can't make up my mind about county market. The stores vary in size and quality of food that can be purchased. Since I have been only to 3 so far this is on average ground. The store is a bit larger than the other ones, but it appears to have a low turn around so the food does not appear as fresh. There is a discount 1 dollar bin as well. All and all I think I will have to go to the other county market on kirby which has the carribou. That is the best location so far.\n\nPros: occasionally good sales, closer than meijer\n\nCons: smaller store, not as fresh as other location\n\nHidden deals:\nSign up for max card mall which is a card that earns points toward gift cards. You can also select online coupons to load to your card from the website. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Last two times through Danny's my car came out with marks it didn't have to begin with and I was upsold for their removal.  Some of it is cash to the guys doing the work (which I don't mind so much) and some of it is for services that I paid the cashier.  \n\nThe clincher was a detail (can't believe I did it) that was promised in 2 hours and took 4 - and my car wasn't clean.  You see, I needed the clay wax treatment rather than the treatment they sold me with the detail.  \n\nI have friends who used to go to Danny's, but they have had the same problems recently.  Danny's wasn't like this a year ago - one of the guys working there said it got a lot worse after the raids.  All I know is I will never be back.  \n\nI promised them I would post my experience on Yelp, and they were not concerned.  They know exactly what they are doing and have no shame.  They are thieves. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Never again will I rent from them.

Don't waste your money. <|endoftext|>

To see how much S Tryon St has changed over the past 60-70 years is amazing. Really like the look/atmosphere of this place.\n\nMy favorite is Spaghetti so I gave theres a try and it was okay....not to die for, not bad just average. Compared to other restaurants I think they should offer you a little more food then they do but i suppose its about equal to Olive Garden. \n\nI was disappointed that they didn't offer any healthy pasta whole wheat replacements.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience....tried something new but I probably won't be going back. I'd recommend someone go there for a meal but I don't think it's going to work itself into one of your regular dine out spots. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's 2005 and I was referred to my normal dentist to Reed for some extra teeth that were under my gum line.  Nothing really affected me but Reed suggested that he remove 3 wisdom teeth and 2 extra teeth below my gum line on my right lower side of my jaw.  So a total of 5 teeth.\n\nLittle did I know he was going to CUT AWAY my gum line and expose the roots of my existing teeth that were FINE. \n\nHe claimed it would be fine and the gums would grow back, they never did. The exposed sections of the roots caused infection in my gums and I lost a molar and am probably going to lose another one this year.  \n\nI haven't been able to chew solid food on the right side of my mouth for the past 9 years.  ridiculous. \n\nI'm currently looking for an oral surgeon to hopefully rectify this HACK JOB that Reed left me with nearly 9 years ago.  Every day of my life I regret going to Reed and after showing the results to my regular dentist, he stopped referring patients to Reed.\n\nEven the desk attendants were pushy about the surgery saying I should have them all removed in one session vs having them done in two sessions.  Clearly this office is money hungry and they don't care about the patient's well being post surgery. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am always searching for good chicken fried steak. This is the best I have ever had! It's so big it might give you a heart attack. Make room for the peach cobbler! It's soooooo good! I can't wait to go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I recently moved to the Phoenix area and joined a bowling league here. It's in an older part of town - but safe. The snackbar is small buy has a fairly decent menu. I had a burger and it was quite tasty - greasy just like a bowling alley burger should be.\n\nThe staff is nice. The scorekeepers have recently been updated from what I was told and do the job - nothing fancy. If you're looking for an \""old school\"" bowling alley - a place to have fun without the attitude or frills then this place is it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Small but enjoyable museum that's perfect for a fun afternoon with the kids. The 'Miracle on the Hudson' exhibit is the centerpiece, but our little ones also enjoyed being able to climb into the cockpit of a Vietnam-era fighter jet and other cool planes. You can go through the whole place in about 90 minutes, and then head over to the nearby runway overlook at Charlotte-Douglas Airport to watch the planes take off and land. Our kids loved it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've lived here all of my life (33 yrs) and somehow I had never heard of this place. The exterior is unassuming, to say the least. \n\nGood food. Huge portions. Excellent service. Mostly under 8 bucks. Definitely worth going to. Don't let the structure fool you. The inside is much nicer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Took an early Acura TSX to them for repair - they resolved that issue, and solved a problem that two dealerships could not - excellent prices and service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We bought our son a 2004 car here about a month ago. So far, we had to have the clutch replaced. Luckily it happened within 3 days of purchasing it so they fixed it for free. BUT, the car has been giving our son trouble when trying to start it. Dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong. You name it - it needs replaced! Over $2000 to get it fixed. And some of these things are safety items and shouldn't be driven by anybody! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all and I WILL NEVER EVER return! Total rip off kind of people! Not trustworthy! I can't imagine doing this to people every day. What kind of people are they? What a sad day. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> **This is a review for the Yoga level 2/3 class at the DC Ranch location**\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect when walking into the dimly lit studio at the gym.  When I laid out my mat and started to stretch, I was in awe of the twinkle ceiling...giving the place a feeling of being outdoors on a warm summer night.  (and it was warm in there... phew!  While not Bikram, the room was toasty)  This place is definitely fancy.... and the people are definitely GYM people.  Debra, the yoga instructor was amazing. \n\nAt first I was put off by the loud dance music during the beginning of our practice, but after a few challenging poses, I didn't let it affect my state of mind.... breathe....\n\nThe pace was quick, a little too quick at times for my breathing, but what made the class special, was the special attention that Debra offered.  I felt rewarded for using my breath when she came over to give me an extra stretch.  When I asked for help with a pose, she not only answered, but later showed how I could get into the same pose from a different place.\n\nThe program was challenging and different from my usual practice at home, if you're NOT a gym person, you may not like it.  But as a Yogi, you should also be able to feel gratitude and joyfulness wherever you practice.  So if you feel like some rock and roll yoga, I highly recommend.  Namaste. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very poor and non friendly service  Price are outrageous. I don't understand why people shop here unless the enjoy paying high prices and enjoy non friendly employees. But, I guess there is a store for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've lived in San Diego and had \"" most likely,\"" the best burritos in the word. Not to mention making many trips south of the border, the burrito I had was above average.\n  The only down side was towards the end it was a little cold.\n  I suppose being in an area with so much Mexican food could effect the rating, if this place were in South Florida or Hawaii, I'd have to give it five stars. Believe me there aren't any great Mexican restaurants there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had a friend in the Emergency Department last month.  I can only say they should have admitted a friend of mine immediately but they didn't.  I am going to say nothing more about that experience.\n\nI want to give an immediate five stars to Dr. Hurowitz of the Medical Sub specialty Clinic.  I will also give those five stars to the young gentleman at the front desk of said clinic.  I will edit this review to give that person's name and the name of a person from another department at a later date.\n\nWhy five stars to these people?  My friend was truly suffering from an acute flare up of rheumatoid arthritis.  When I arranged with the front desk to get a wheelchair stat the next day, it happened.  Dr. Hurowitz spent ten minutes with my friend and had her in a hospital bed forty five minutes later.  It was heartening to see a physician recognize that a fifty eight year old woman who could hardly walk and was swollen to about three times her body size all over had a real problem which is more than I could say for the ED Department.  On top of that, Dr. H showed an incredibly compassionate attitude in working with my friend, Mary Lou, and believe me she needed it.\n\nWe have been back to the clinic after Mary Lou spent five days in the hospital and had what seemed, every test know to man run on her and was seen by  as many Dr's in every area.  He is realistic enough with her to say that my friend's condition is unusual and there is more work to be done.  With both agree, that with a specialist like Dr. Hurowitz, what needs to be done will eventually occur.  He's that type of physician.\n\nThere is something to be said to having your care at a teaching hospital. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was fortunate enough to be invited to the Phoenix Suns vs Houston Rockets basketball game on Saturday night - and managed to score a premium seat in a private suite (a sweet suite).\n\nAn amazing game with Shaq onboard (the Suns trounced the Rockets). \n\nAnyway the point is that US Airways Center is a perfect venue - several cool bar/restaurants circle the site for pre and post game activities. We grabbed a brew over at Alice Cooperstown then headed to the game.\n\nWe parked in the garage that bordered the arena, and conveniently walked from our parking spot directly into the place.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that smokers are treated more like murderers - I had to walk a 1/2 mile to an outdoor spot each time I wanted a puff (which when drinking is fairly often). I understand non-smokers don't want to breath my smoke - I don't understand how an enterprise this large doesn't have a few patios for us unclean heathens. As anti-smoking as some people are, remember it IS legal and certainly less of a poison than hard alcohol (which the lounges here gleefully serve). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It had been quite a while since we ate at a Cracker Barrel. We stopped there when shopping at East Towne Mall. I ordered the pot roast and my husband ordered chicken and dumplilngs. Yuck! It had more salt than you'd find in food at McDonalds. The meat in the pot roast tasted processed. The dumplings were slimy. The vegetables were so salty, they were inedible. Pros: The shop is very cute. Cons: Don't eat the food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After finding Ryan's on yelp I decided to check it out.  First off I was a little thrown off at walking through the warehouse but they have super helpful and friendly staff!  I FINALLY found a leash a collar set I adore and at $15 (after tax) for them you can't beat it!  I scored a great collection of new toys, an AWESOME set of nail clippers and a very useful travel dog water/food dish all for $38!\n\nI will be making trips there regularly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this restaurant. Great lunch specials and a huge menu. Lot's of sushi specials. Fast service and a great lunch staff. Will definatley be back. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Express lunch service during the day and wait service in the evening. Several wines to choose from, also Sake and Japanese beers. Good happy hour specials 3 to 6 and 8:30 to closing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  I have been going to Pro Nails for the past 7 years and couldn't be happier.  My sisters and I enjoy going to get pedicures together.  Not only are they affordable, but who doesn't enjoy a good hot rock massage???  We also always get designs done on our toes and they do an amazing job.  Tracy (the owner) is absolutely delightful and always remembers our names, gives us discounts on various occasions, and gives us Christmas gifts!  The salon is clean, the staff are kind, and I have never been disappointed.  I recommend this place to all the closes people in my life and everyone who has given them a chance won't go anywhere else now!  Check them out.  I assure you, you will not leave disappointed! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I ate breakfast here last Sunday and were not disappointed. The place wasn't too busy so it was easy to walk in and grab a table. \n\nI ordered the hash mash which is corned beef, scrambled eggs, potatoes and cheese in a skillet. It was very filling and delicious. However they did put way too much cheese on top and after a while it become too much. I would order the hash mash again, minus the cheese.\n\nMy husband ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were big and fluffy and the bacon was thick and tasty, not fatty and floppy.\n\nI looked at the other items on the menu and everything else sounds great. Lots of deli sandwiches, soups and their desserts look very yummy.\nI plan to check them out for lunch or dinner sometime as well as coming back for breakfast. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Somehow, I have neglected to review Postino Arcadia... so let me correct that mistake.  And now that there are 300+ positive reviews on here -- this is just to pile on the love.\n\nLove the atmosphere\nLove the food (the bruschetta! my mouth is watering now...)\nLove the friendly service\nLove the location\nLove live music (though it can disrupt conversations)\n \nThe only \""don't Love\""?  Parking.  \nBut that is a small price to have a nice spot to enjoy food with friends. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just read CP's review and I must add my ditto to the 1 star rating.  Of late, I have also been disappointed with the baked goods at La Grande.  Particularly the TC sweets.  After my last visit, where the coffee cake was dried out and what I thought to be \""old\"" and the 1/2 frozen cup cake, I said no more.  \nI didn't even try to return it, because I felt the superiority vibe of the place and figured they don't need me or my dollars.  The only item they offer that is unique is the english muffins.  Sorry not enough in my book to bother with. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.\n\nThe best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  the food is ok. i went on a wednesday night for the breakfast buffet and the waitresses were ok- but the food was horrible. i had 3 pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold. one pancake i couldnt actually bite into. another thing is, the bacon had excess fat on it. i would not come back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food , this is not the place for you. I had a green chili burro with rice and beans, it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had, this the place for those out of towners, You know the ones from those cold states, who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like. I have to say it is edible, you probably won't die, BUT DEFINATELY NOT ENJOYABLE, TASTEFUL, FLAVORFUL, OR MEMORABLE.\n This is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur. \n As for  the service it was average, not anything special. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm from NJ and was told by some friends that I need to have East Carolina BBQ. Well I was not disappointed. This place was great. Service was even better. I will be visiting again next time I am in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went on my birthday after St. Francis had an hour long wait.  Very happy with our decision.  Had the ginger martini.  Very sweet, but very good.  Then, we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate.  The corn fritters are mind blowing good!  Never had anything like that before.  I had the tofu pad thai, which was perfect!  The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have a degree in hotel and restaurant management so you could probably say that i am a little more critical than most people when it comes to eating out.  Tonight my girlfriend and I went to Christo's.  Our server was horribly slow at taking our drink orders and a table that came in after us already had their salads before we had even placed our order.  The food was mediocre at best we got to go boxes because after an hour of sitting in the restaurant that apparently caters to close personal friends of Abe Lincoln that have nothing more to do than waste an evening at an overpriced restaurant to fill up on caesar salad that tastes like it was dipped in anchovy paste and wish that you hadn't ordered the veal genovese because it just looks like someone threw up on your plate you just want to get out of there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Another reason that I love the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is because I can always get through the security in record speed. I have never waited longer than 10 minutes and that is pretty amazing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm from Chicago. I shopped at Whole Foods, I know that its my choice to spend that much money on food. So that's not why it gets 2 stars. It gets two stars because the selection is really limited and lame and the people are pretentious (and usually I have a very high tolerance for pretention.)\nMaybe its because someone talked it up to be such a great thing that left me feeling so cold once I walked in the doors. Maybe it was the overall lack of options. They didn't even carry vegetarian options that Dominick's and Jewel in the Chicagoland area (like Schnuck's and IGA) had provided that got me so riled up.\nI've only been here once. I haven't gone back because the experience was awkward enough for a one-time-only visit kind of thing. The people weren't friendly or helpful. In fact, when I asked if they ever carried a certain product they were really rude in their reply. They didn't have any of the things I was looking for that I hadn't already seen somewhere else... they had stuff you can find at Meijer or Schnuck's! So why should I spend so much more to get the same exact thing somewhere else!? That's when its irritating to see just how jacked up the prices are! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  At the beginning of every semester, I compare prices among the three campus bookstores.  T.I.S. is almost always the cheapest of the three stores.\n\nHowever, I can usually find all my books for much cheaper on Amazon.com.  My Discrete Math book cost $125 (used) at T.I.S., and I found it for 80 cents on Amazon.  \n\nMy recommendation: email your professors before the semester starts to ask what books you'll need.  Order the books on Amazon or eBay. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I appreciate small, quaint bookstores and I understand that the big box Barnes & Nobles can be a bit frustrating. But there's a difference between a \""Mom 'n' Pop\"" book shop and a poorly-stocked one with books that pertain to a really limited scope of interest. I was in here early one weekday afternoon and I was the only person in the store. The few shelves of books they have at The Bookmark were somewhat sparsely stocked. The store has little atmosphere and seems out of place in Founder's Hall. I mean, I'm sure they could order whatever you'd like, but you'll need to wait a while and you'll also pay through the nose for it--publisher's price--because they do have to pay uptown rent after all. \n\nWhen I walk into a bookstore I like to be inspired to read and I want to be excited by what's on the shelves. I could spend hours in a Barnes & Noble just pulling interesting stuff off the shelves and perusing the pages. There's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was one of the vendors that came highly recommended by my wedding Planner. She could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were. From our first meeting with their Event Coordinator, we were lead to believe that MHI would offer outside catering if they were not able to customize our menu. We wanted traditional Laotian food. They said that this was possible and so we signed. Everything that transpired from that moment went downhill. They did not keep their promise and so we had to work with the Chef to prepare our dishes. After several tastings that we were billed for (it was never stated on our contract  that we had to pay for these), the food came out ok. \n\nThe final straw was 2 weeks before our wedding when we got the bill that was to be paid in full,  which was completely inaccurate. They tried to explain to us and our wedding planner what the breakdown of cost was but nothing on that invoice made sense. My planner told us to hold off on paying until she spoke to Billy, the owner. She also mentioned that they had allowed a couple to pay on the day of so we should be ok. After several back and forth, we decided to proceed on the payment even though we didn't agree with the amount.  MHI Planner emailed us midday and said the owner, Billy, would not accept our credit card and demanded we paid him cash or money order in full or our event would be cancelled. We told him that the contract explicitly states that a cc is an acceptable form of payment and that he could take. He said that he would take us to court and sue us if we didn't pay. We were under the notion that he was going to cancel our event b/c we refused to give in to his demands but two days later he ran our credit card w/o our knowledge and called our planner to let us know all is well & that we could have our wedding day. We never got our money back and we ended up not having our wedding there. I don't think any bride & groom who endured what we did would want to have their wedding there as well. We had to find a new venue at the last minute and rejigger our wedding day schedule because of Billy. \n\nFolks - there is something sketchy when a business owner demands you pay in cash when the contract doesn't state that. Please beware of this. I have all of our correspondences saved if anyone wants to see them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Happy hour menu seemed great until we received the bill and nothing we ordered was happy hour priced. When we asked the server to explain the discrepancy he replied with, \""oh I should have explained that better,\"" and then proceeded to walk away. The pizza is worth 5 stars the happy hour menu and service is worth 1. The owners need to have a separate happy hour menu or train their servers to be more forthcoming with correct information. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The absolute worst service I've ever had in my life! Waited 15 minutes to get drink orders, then another 15 minutes for our beers. Waited another 30 minutes for our wings on wing Wednesday and my friend didn't get his crab legs for 1 hour and 10 minutes after we ordered. Over all it ended up being a 2 and a half dinner after a 12 hour day of work we were not expecting. The 4 of us had our own tabs and the waitress screwed up every check. We felt hostage, all we wanted to do was pay and leave. Then she didn't bring us a pen and we had to ask another server. DONT COME HERE IF YOU WANT A QUICK MEAL! And as a side note the girls look like there all in high school. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Note the date on this review because, yes, this place used to be awesome. I keep giving it chances and now i am DONE. I just had the worst meal ever here. It is the NV salad. It used to be my favorite and i would come once a week back in the day. This salad was so nasty...they forgot the cheese...forgot the salsa and sour cream...it was disgusting. Ad the draft beer is luke warm. Not surprising it was empty when it used to be packed on friday night for dinner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of my all time favorite restaurants. Has gone through a couple of face lifts with the most recent being the best. The bar side, where I go almost every time is much more comfortable and cooler than before. \n\nThe drinks. I think they have a pretty decent cocktail and wine list. They are very well made and although expensive, pretty generous. Really like Laura the bartender. She is solid. The beers on tap are minimal and pretty safe bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle, but not a beer snob Mecca. \n\nThe food. I really enjoy places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things. I can't remember a small plate I did not like and can remember a few I wish would come back.....uhhh soft shells...  Usuall don't go for an entree but my wife and I split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious and very cleverly done. \n\nIt is expensive but very high quality and It's a great place to come alone, as a couple or a group. One of BB's gems. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome things about Mon Aimee:\n\na. Kind, knowledgeable, attentive staff.\n\nb. Excellent variety of chocolates from throughout the US as well as tons of international options. (two favorites: Poco Dolce from San Francisco and Eclipse from San Diego)\n\nc. New products appear frequently (exciting for a regular visitor)\n\nd. As other reviewers have enthusiastically mentioned, CAPOGIRO GELATO, dark chocolate flavor. Seriously, the best I've found in the US (...and by that I mean darkest chocolate. It's always too light elsewhere!). We're really lucky they distribute it in Pittsburgh. \n\nMy only caveat would be that for items you can find in the grocery store, such as Chocolove bars, you're better off grabbing them at Whole Foods, Giant Eagle, or Right by Nature - you may save about a buck per bar. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day, we were a party of eight, we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other \npatrons were given gift cards and comped bills. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have no idea how things are on the Departure side of Security.   But, for anyone picking up a passenger here, this is one of the worst airports I can imagine.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.\n\nNow to be clear, this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like. There is no ambiance. No \""decor\"". No table service. No boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is \""infused\"". You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.\n\nBut if you want a delicious cheesesteak, I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else. \n\nThe two best hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  - Rudy's and the Triangle bar. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After a personal call and lengthy discussion on me wanting something unique and different and not a standard vase of flowers in our school colors of white and blue, I was asked if a unique container would be ok and I said that is what I wanted unique and different, from cheerleaders to the other cheer coach, for $100. When I saw that it was a vase of a few blue and white flowers, I was furious and feel ripped off!!! The order my family placed online was so awesome!! A puppy made of flowers in a ceramic pumpkin candy dish!! It was not even $60 including se day shipping!! The photos on his website have several larger arrangements made for $65-85!!! I sent several emails with photos comparing the two and have not received a reply back!! I will be calling!\nBUYERS BEWARE!!!! I guess he thought I would not see then!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here to get 4 tires and they were extremely quick! Within one hour, they quoted me (a great price) and had the tires installed. Was surprised that they came in lower than other competitors, so definitely check them out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  LGO has just gone down a million notches for me. I am so sorely disappointed to find out they no longer carry Tammie Coe baked goods, which were the main reason I chose to visit in the mornings for a muffin or after dinner for a delicious sweet ending. \n\nWhen I asked the front cashier about it, she said they wanted to take on the baking responsibilities themselves, which I understood, so I gave them a chance. The Princess Cupcake was *so* god awful flavorless with a horrible texture that I ended up giving it away. Seriously, who makes an awful cupcake?! \n\nI also tried a new muffin- slice of heaven-which was good, and an oatmeal raisin vegan cookie, and the butterscotch oatmeal cookie. The butterscotch one was good, but all else fell short of expectations. I am sad to say, I think I need to find a new favorite place. \n\nVery disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is not about my stay at the Biltmore but about not staying here. I purchased a gift certificate at a baseball related charity function in Oct. When I went to redeem my gift certificate (which I wanted use during the baseball Spring training months) I was told the dates I had chosen were unavailable. OK, I understand as on my certificate it did say subject to availability, so I choose a couple of other dates. After a couple of phone calls I was finally told that all Spring training dates were blackout. My problem with all of this is that it took many phone messages and emails to finally have someone tell me this. The Director of Sales and Marketing contact person who was on my gift certificate NEVER returned an email or phone call and when asked if there were any other options none were offered. I would also like to add that I have a 2 night stay certificate and was looking to stay 2 additional nights at full price. Bottom line really bad bad customer service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was a bit nervous and excited to try Bikram yoga.  I've heard a lot about it ranging from it's the best thing ever to no way.  The whole experience was great.  My instructor was Jen and she pulled all of newbies aside and explained what to expect and most importantly we don't need to be heros - listen to our bodies and take breaks as needed.  She continously talked through the entire class; walking us through each step and breath.  She corrected form as needed and provided the encouragement to get through each pose.  I'm hooked!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place often has interesting exhibits. The one they showcased when I went was on the history of a pirate ship and crew, very interesting. Only downside, most of the non-travelling exhibits are dull unless you're younger than 13. Worth a look, but costs a few more dollars than I expected. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very upsetting!  Park 51 cafe is under new management.  Some of the new staff not near as friendly.  Norman, who has been there over 20 years is gone.  He was always quick to fill tea and bring out food if the waitresses were busy.  My husband and I started coming here when we were dating.  Now we need to find another breakfast place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love love love this place.  Total neighborhood coffee shop vibe, great coffee, nothing overpriced, and my personal fav- big variety in the pastry department- every time I go it seems like there's a different selection of yummy stuff to chose from!  \nSuper friendly baristas, and this place is always busy- the corporate business scene early in the AM, post-yoga class moms mid-morning, the study crowd in the afternoons, and a bit of a social scene if you catch it on the right night (esp. with G-spot right next door!).  \nThere's free wifi, and a cozy yet open back patio with great views of Camelback- perfect because there's always seating and it's covered for shade (or in case of rain!). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Only had the Chef Salad and while it lived up to the name in portion size, it was boring as all get out. I'm gonna have to try to their pizza on of these days. No lunch special besides the slice of cheese pizza, booooooo. \n\nReally, nothing special. 12 bucks for a salad and an iced tea. Should have went to Picazzo's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Postino!  I have visited more than half dozen times.  The waistaff are always friendly yet professional, and the atmosphere can't be beat for a group of friends.  It is not an ideal first date spot because it is \""open\"" seating and usually very full.  However, I meet girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta all the time.  \n\nMake sure to have the soup of the day, a great glass of wine (or a bottle!), and DO NOT MISS the bruschetta.\n\nEnjoy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am so happy they got rid of those awful bar stools!!!   We often choose not to walk in to Casbah without a reservation because the bar area was historically uncomfortable.  They have traded out the old stools that were screwed in to the floor, too far from your companions, and didn't comfortably turn to face people (who thought that was a good idea?) in for some admittedly less attractive but functional chairs,  I'm a big fan of the lunch and dinner there--we'll add that more often to our walk-in list now, <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Prepurchased my item online, the iphone 6.\nOnce I arrived at the location, the \""help\"" was more concerned with getting me out of the store by telling me the they were done taking in new customers before asking the more appropriate line of questions. Employee kind of got defensive when I called him on his lack of professionalism. After getting on the same page, a different employee helped me in getting through the rest of the process. Employee had no interest in helping in setting up my new phone, but that was ok. I had no interest in having them help me after dealing with the first employee. Great store, great inventory, employee customer skills must improve so that they may treat all customers fairly. Try to help before trying to get rid of. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First-time visitor despite living in the neighborhood forEVer. What a hidden gem! Walked right in, no wait (ok, it was Monday before lunch), and the manicurists were so sweet and pleasant. Not a massive collection of colors, but I found exactly what I wanted. They did a beautiful job (standard pedicure, for $18), with a nice long pumice-stone scrub-down, and I noticed the technician cleaning the basin directly afterward. Lovely employees, good hygiene, and an impeccable pedicure at SUCH a good price. Central Nails will be my new go-to pedi place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes \""whoops.\"" and tosses it on the floor!! \n\nFast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.)\nFirst off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \""busy.\"" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza. \nThank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been coming to this location since 2006 when our office relocated to this area. I have always enjoyed excellent service from the staff and management. I visit at least 2 times a day. One thing I couldn't and still can't  understand is why they continue to have the turn over in staff especially management. These are people who make your day and have brought a smile to my face whenever I've had a bad day. I would hire any number of them at any time. I have driven past other locations just because I enjoy the atmosphere and staff at this location. No longer. Their most recent management change has left the place without a soul. It's a change that you can sense  and see ( they did  some lite remodeling)  when you walk in the door. This was the day after her abrupt departure. This individual was always here to fill in for staff or to make sure the place was taken care of. She was here in the snow storm this year. Amazing right? \nI'm a bottomless member and got ten people from work to buy them from here bc I enjoyed this place and it's service. \nI will not be getting one next year and doubt I will frequent as much in the future. It's not the same! As I'm wiping down my own table to sit down, it is quiet and lacks the laughter,  smiles, and business I have always appreciated. \nA lesson  for senior management and owners to take to heart. Take care of your most important assets your staff! \nI hope to see a turn around but in the weeks since the change I have seen only one thing a decrease in the service and quality I've come to expect. At this time I can no longer promote this place as one I'd recommend to friends or coworkers <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I finally got to hit this place up and I must say, I liked it!  I ordered the italian stallion sandwich with fries and thought it was very yummy.  Steve was great and attentive and I really liked the whole look of the restaurant.  I would definately reccomend going here with a group of friends.  The parking situation is kinda wierd, so go before 3 and it's free in the lot, or else meter it up on the street.  Oh, and order a black velvet, because they actually know how to layer their drinks here.  I would love to check this place out on a busier night. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I went here for a nice birthday dinner. I thought it would have mire Japanese options on the menu being named soba.\n\n I ordered the black truffle-potato samosa which was not bad. \n\nI also had the chopped salad which I suprisingly really enjoyed despite it being iceburgh lettuce which is definitely not what I use for a good salad. I wish they didn't put fried batter all over it though. \n\nLast I had the vegetarian curry dish, the only vegetarian main I found. It was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice! No delicious fragrant jasmine rice....Also deep fried the Naan, didn't enjoy that. The potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall. \n\nWe were put at a table in the very corner of the third floor and all I had to stare at was a wall and an ugly floating tv hutch. It was very cold.\n\nWe were the first people in the restaurant but took FOREVER to get served. Everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor. \n\nNeedless to say I was extremely disappointed. I heard umi is also one of their restaurants and I loved it so I thought this one may have been just as good. It was not enjoyable. \n\nAlso the valet took FOREVER though it's a tiny parking lot right outside the front door and the booth was freezing despite a heater hanging way too high and no door. Heat rises....I thought most people knew this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Carmon's Creperie released their new lunch menu yesterday, and we had the great pleasure of being there to sample it!\nAs always, options are really creative, but more importantly, delicious! Three of us tried the Scrambled Eggs Crepe with sausage, the Creamed Spinach Crepe with bacon and caramelized onions and the Hamburger crepe...you heard me, a Hamburger crepe! \n All portions were generous, perfectly cooked and quick to the table. The scrambled eggs were really tasty, light and the perfect brunch... they would go so well with the House Signature Bloody Mary. The creamed spinach was smooth, sophisticated and rich. The hamburger crepe intrigued me on the menu, and I was suspicious of it, but I have learned to trust the excellent chef at Carmon's so I knew if it was on the menu, it must be good. And it was. It came with house fries which are to die for, and the crepe itself had all the flavors and textures of a hamburger, but with an Excellent pattie... this is now my favorite burger in town! \nCarmon's have also announced a very nicely priced Wednesday night Crepe/Wine flight for $28...reservations at 217 352 5880 <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was having a craving for Mexican food.  El Toro is less than 5 minutes from where I live and based on the reviews here it seemed like a solid choice.  I've not yet been to other Mexican restaurants in the area, so I can't say if this is really the best local option.\n\nHowever, based on my experience I would say that it is indeed a solid choice.  No frills, filling food, with LOTS AND LOTS of cheese and beans.  Oh man.  So much cheese.  So many beans.  I got Vegetarian B (...why do all Mexican restaurants follow the same formula for their vegetarian menus?) and it was good.  I really have no complaints about the food, and it was cheap plus we had a coupon, making it even cheaper.  Service was also friendly and fast; as in, we ordered our food, and were eating it less than 10 minutes later.\n\nI've had better Mexican food (oh Plaza Azteca...you're sooo far away right now...) but this wasn't bad at all.  The decor leaves something to be desired.  It was a bit weird and kind of looked like the remains of an old person's garage sale.  Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal once the screaming children sitting behind us were gone.\n\nOh yeah...and for some bizarre reason there are bottles on ketchup on each table...no hot sauce or anything...just ketchup...at a Mexican restaurant...am I missing something? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best Foid Gras and food presentation. Desserts were awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just average unfortunately.  The good:  My drink...dark and stormy is going to be my new standby.  The mediocre:  Everything else.\n\nBurger was just so so as were the fries.  The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce, but that couldn't save it.  When asked how our food was I was honest and could tell the waiter was taken aback. I mean seriously, don't ask me if you don't wanna know.  I was polite about it, but said that the dessert was just average.  And questioned why it was cold.  Bread pudding is always warm no?  He also got docked a few points for twice trying to take my plate while I still had more then half of my food left.  He actually removed my girlfriend's drink while she was still working on it!  \n\nIt was nice to have a late night eating option in uptown, but unless someone else wants to go I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We were at Lidia's for an early dinner before seeing a show.  They have a great wine list and our server made some excellent suggestions.  The food was wonderful.  Several of us had the Pasta Trio.  This is a sampler dish with three different pastas prepared and served at your table.  Afterwards, you can get additional servings of your favorite from the Trio.  Of course, none of us even had room for an additional serving.  If you get the Trio, I'd recommend getting the option that includes the salad and dessert.  It's a great deal and you know you'll want it anyway! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This Giant Eagle is one of the few that only use the Giant Eagle name, but is owned independently of the Giant Eagle company. It is a franchise, which may explain why it is such a dump.\n\nTo shop here, you first have to get into the store, which means dodging bums and people selling EBT cards just outside the store. \n\nOnce inside, you have to find a cart that has all 4 wheels, travels in a straight line, doesn't make squeeky noises, and isn't wet or filled with trash. \n\nThen go to the produce department. Whenever I go to the produce department of any other grocer, I notice some of the produce has fallen on the floor, and some has rolled under the shelves. I'm almost positive that this produce is collected and sent to the Cedar ave Giant Eagle.\n\nThis store is not clean.\n\nTo its credit, they still have people who bag groceries for you, and the staff are decent, especially considering the demoralizing nature of their work environment. The location is also very good.\n\nIf the Cedar Ave Giant Eagle wants to improve, it needs to hire security to keep the parking lot clear of panhandlers, get new shopping carts, get rid of the self-checkout registers, improve their produce department, and have an overnight cleaning team. Until then, they will keep pushing me and everyone else to shop with their competition. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I hadn't been to TCooks for a while because I hadn't been to PHX, but it was always one of my favorite places to eat in the area and I'm happy to report that I still feel the same.  The grounds are beautiful, the bar area is warm and inviting and the food is delicous.  I recommend sitting outside and highly recommend getting the lobster tortellini with lobster on top - a little rich (I'd like it better without the butter sauce I think), but just delectable.  They have a wonderful wine list too - extensive and not outrageously priced.    \nIt will continue to be on my list of must visits when I'm in PHX! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \""Excuse me, miss?\"" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us \""good luck\"". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables. \n\nThe front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I only gave it five stars because I can only give five stars. I was in town for 24 hours, it probably will not return to Champaign again. I wish I could take this restaurant with me on the road. It was a pleasure to have this restaurant available in the middle of Illinois. The scallops and pork were delicious. The grilled octopus salad is a must. Portions are not huge, but adequate. In my party, one person have the ribeye. It was fantastic. The other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good. All in all this restaurant must not be missed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I had an amazing dining experience last night from start to finish for our first time in this amazing restaurant. The ambience, staff, food and drinks were outstanding! The pre dinner cocktails were a perfect start. My wife had the Pure Bliss and I had the Spritz. I felt like I was back in Italy sipping on this refreshing aperitif! Marcellino's home made fresh pasta was nothing short of outstanding. My wife had the Strachetti w truffles and sausage and I had the tortoloni stuffed w filet. Ridiculously good. The home made Tartufo accompanied w an espresso martini was the perfect ending to a perfect night. Our servers Daniel and Mike were excellent as were our bus boys who were pleasant and attentive. Expect to pay but originally being from NYC we are used to these prices. I never mind paying when you have such an amazing date night experience! Grazie mille Marcellino!  We will definitely be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Cherry House is good for two things: quick and inexpensive Chinese food. Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But, hey, they carry most of the westernized classics.\n\nUS CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM \""CHOW MEIN\"":\nI learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \""Hong Kong style\"" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \""chow mein\"" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \""lo mein\"" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?\n\nAt Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.\n\nThat said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Bring your wallet or if you have little self control it maybe better to just bring some cash and leave the plastic and pay check at home. \n\nThe smell of the meats curing on the racks when you walk in to the front deli will transport you to meat Valhalla. \n\nThis is what a deli is supposed to be. All their meats here are delicious. \n\nIf the lady behind the counter is mean to you, you probably deserve it. \n\nIf your a first timer just order the European Sub. All they're cold cut <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place was recommended by a soon to be non-friend. \n\nPortions were small, prices were big, taste was average, server was uninterested borderline annoyed, nothing to write home about. I won't be back. Nuf said! <|endoftext|>

This place is not worth the price! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We left after the bar tender insulted my friend. I can see having a bad night, but do not take it out on your customers. To top off our bad experience, this place steals your money. We asked for our check after dealing with the offensive bar tender, and wrote NO TIP on the tip line. Later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a $5 tip! That is not ok! <|endoftext|>

Every employee and volunteer at Classroom Central is really passionate about what they do. Risa G., the volunteer coordinator, is great to work with. I highly recommend donating school supplies or volunteering time at Classroom Central. You can trade six hours of volunteer time (3 hours for current teachers) for one teacher shopping day! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place offered a pretty good selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The breakfast was my favorite.  They had a buffet for about 15 bucks which included juice, coffee, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, pigs in a blanket, ham, omelette station, Belgian waffles, a variety of different breads, and muffins.  I say give it a try. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to begin this by saying that I am not from Chicago.  The midwest, yes, but I have only visited, but given the crowds this place packs in, I had high expectations of the dogs and the burgers.  \n\nMy boyfriend said, \""eh\"" on the hamburger and I had the same opinion on the hot dog.  Nothing special and I have definitely had better - even at a roadside stand.  The service and atmosphere were great along with the prices, but I didn't feel like any of the food made me want to go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  FYI this place is closed..it's now Bluewater Grille. But looks like the exact same place pretty much..add a couple booths and take out a wall. Decided to try the 5 entree choices for $5 deal that they had going. The Sourdough bread is AMAZING!!! My friend and I tried the Fish & Chips.. It was good no doubt, and many will enjoy. But it just wasn't unique enough or amazing for me. There are too many restaurants in Az that DO fit that bill.. to return to \""decent\"". The fish is good, it's fresh but it's just that. <|endoftext|>

Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.\n\nI did not get ill from the food here\n\nHowever....\n\n $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???\n\nI kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.\nnope.\n\nThought we might split one.\nnope.\n\nMy sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.\n\n$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)\n\nLeft the waitress $5.\n\nGave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.\n\n..the fries were good tho. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Walking Uptown on a Sunday morning before church, my wife, daughter, and I stopped into Mert's.  Our waitress gave us the specials but said them so fast and with such apparent disinterest that neither my wife nor I understood any of what she said.  We ended up ordering one of the specials after seeing them on a chalkboard, only to find out after some more confusing, disinterested interaction with our waitress that they had stopped the special just minutes before (9:30am).  Don't know what that meant; did they run out of spinach?  Strange. We ended up with two other omelettes, the garden and the shrimp creole.  We had to ask three different waitresses for our accompanying toast and biscuit, and once we had our food, our waitress interrupted our prayer to ask if we needed ketchup (understandable, but most servers notice bowed heads, even if it's kinda awkward).  We did need the ketchup, but it didn't come until the end of our meal, and my wife's home fries were already cold.  My regular cup of coffee was mediocre, my shrimp creole omelette had 2 small shrimp inside (super disappointing, as they were tasty), making my $8 omelette mostly egg and tomato sauce, and my wife's toast was hard as a rock.\n\nObviously a rough experience for us this morning, but Mert's gets the second star because my wife loved her omelette (the garden), my biscuit and grits were pretty good, and they let us choose our seating (with a young child, this can be pretty important). We won't be back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Beware!! They didn't even deserve a one star.\n This company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing. All they want is you to sign on the dotted line and they got you! The 1 bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking DUMP when we moved in. The ceiling fan was ready to fall on our heads, there was black all over the a/c vents and the shelves in the closet were literally falling off the wall and the carpet had huge nasty stains everywhere. We were told our place was clean and ready to move in. \nI have a medical condition called Cystic Fibrosis, I am on a lot of medication and my meds get delivered by UPS or FedEx to the front office. After the third box of my meds arrived, in about a weeks time, the leasing staff labeled me as being contagious and treated me like dirt. \nAfter being there for two months, my doctor at MUSC in Charleston told me I have to live close to the hospital in order to get proper treatment and be able to go into the hospital when I am sick. We gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter. The manager said, oh that's fine don't worry about it feel better (in her fake voice). Now, two years later I see they have put me on collection for $2000. \nNo way will they get away with this. Do not rent from these Losers! How do they sleep at night <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It took me several years to find a family doctor that I could truly trust. I found Dr. Goldman about 2.5 years ago after having a severe allergic reaction and he was able to help me pin-point the cause and put me on a path to recovery.  Dr. Goldman and his nurse Maddie are truly great!\nI am saddened to say I am now leaving this practice because of a silly Admin fee they have now introduced along with a calling list they put their patients on to receive recorded advertising messages of medical services they provide. Really, you want me to pay $49 a month so you can send me infomercial voicemails to spend more money at your practice?!?!  I am generally a healthy person and maybe visit the doctor once or twice a year.  They already bill my insurance up the wazoo and also charge me a co-pay every visit, is that not enough?   Maybe if this doctors office was a luxurious spa, with outstanding customer service, would I consider spending a yearly fee. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This has been on my radar for a while. See the pictures. First off this is important, when you walk in you smell smoke so I knew it was going to be good. Very woody and tons of awards and plaques etc. Thy were not as smokey as I wanted and boldly came sauced. They were fall off the bone and had that pink smoke ring on the inside. I had the half rack with beans and potato salad. The ribs were pretty good and I really liked the sauce and bought a bottle. The beans were nothing special and the potato salad was average. The beans would be great if they were smoked and hade little bits of meat in them. Sides are usually not the star and this was the case. The ribs are worth going for, my friends said this was there new BBQ place for them and they will be black. One person said the brisket sandwich was really good. Over all this is a solid BBQ rib place. Two thumbs up <|endoftext|>

I understand that you have to deal with some points on your transactions, but hey that is business and if you feel that this was hitting your bottom line I would suggest you re-evaluate your strategy on pricing. The coffee, meh it was okay but I have experienced way better, please re-consider your 25 cent credit card charge, it's tacky. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There is nothing really to complain about here.  This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It's definitely for the expense account crowd.  It's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I've been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It's like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm, Ruth's, Capital Grille, etc.).  The bar is pretty lame, but I'm guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  Capital Grille or Hyde Park bar is much better for bar scene.  But, one thing I definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  If you've never been to Mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the PRIME cheeseburger trio or the Filet sandwiches for only 6 DOLLARS.  Plus, the fries are awesome.  The dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  The service is awesome because I'm guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  The food is great.  However, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  I eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (Very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  Stay away from the filet.  I mean it's tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  I'm guessing if you're like me you don't go to Mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  Get the Cajun ribeye.  I can't remember if Pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do I would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  I also suggest getting the \""lazy\"" lobster.  There are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  It's pure indulgence.  The asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  The spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  You should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle'.  Remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  I wish the bar was better, because if it was I'd go here more often.  This place is exactly what you would expect.  And, that's a good thing. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am a loyal Marriott lifetime platinum which when I add up all of my Marriott stays, I have spent more than 4 years of my life in Marriott hotels. I hate to write a bad review of a Marriott property. I have stayed at this hotel several times and had remembered it being better than it is. Let's start with the fact the the property is dated and in need of a refresh. But I stay at a lot of older properties and the customer service usually makes up for the oldness of the property. The TV's in the rooms are the old flat screens that were put into Marriott's way back when they first started switching to flat screens. They are definitely undersized for the rooms. Probably one of the most frustrating things is their concierge lounge. I went to the lounge to have snacks and watch Sunday night football...and they can't get the game in the lounge! Their TV in the lounge does not get NBC! Oh...and the attendant told me that the manager knows it because people were upset last Sunday night as well...but has done nothing to fix it. Hows that for caring for your customers? Not very Marriott if you ask me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is one of the best breakfasts I have had! Is the decor dated? Absolutely but it just adds to the nostalgic charm! The place just reeks of beef cooking... Ahhh delicious! Check out the pastry cases!!!! OMG, is all I have to say! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\nI had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The pizza was fine. My issue is that, if you aren't like other pizza places with your pricing, you should maybe tell me that when I call to order a medium with two toppings. We ended up with a $36 pizza that will take us days to eat, when I THOUGHT I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage on half. All young kids working there. No professionalism. No explaination of anything. 50 cents per slice for every topping? Well yeah we got 14 slices, so do the math. NOT a medium. Boxed up horribly, so on our 3 minute ride home, the box was leaking grease out of the corner. I was so upset over spending nearly $40 on something that I thought would be cheap and easy, I couldn't even enjoy the pizza. Its just whatever pizza anyway. \n\nSave your money and go to Slice on Broadway. 1/3 of the price,  staff is wonderful,  and they have a liquor license and fair prices. Slice should get half the publicity this place gets. \n\nNever mind that I've lived in Pittsburgh all my life and have never heard of Betos until I moved 3 streets behind it. NOT a \""Pittsburgh institution.\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money! <|endoftext|>

Doors are closed...!?! Thanks dixies!

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards.

Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I ask?\n\nThe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband and I eat here pretty regularly. Is \""traditional\"" Hawaiian boxed lunch fare healthy? Not so much. Spam is on the menu, people!Think grilled or fried chicken, fish, or beef, sticky white rice, and the most delicious macaroni salad ever. I've not cared for the appetizers, frankly, but we have only tried the Spam musubi and the Crab \""Langoons\"". We really like the BBQ chicken and especially the chicken katsu (breaded chicken cutlets cut into strips- dip into the fabulous zingy katsu sauce). They also have soups, burgers, and salads. The portions are quite large for a \""regular\"" meal. I always make 2 meals out of it, but Hubby can usually finish his. Aloha Kitchen does a few things better (and also has great Kahlua pig on Saturdays which Ono never has), but for a quick and filling out of the ordinary weekday dinner, Ono hits the spot. <|endoftext|>

So effing delicious!\n\nBefore we left the sushi chef showed us a roll for some people at the other end of the sushi bar. For the more adult crowd, it was called the Big Johnson roll. Going to try that next time I go, lol. Hilarious!\n\nOur waitress was good as well. Kept drinks full and very nice. Had a great time and can't wait to introduce friends to this place! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I would like to respond to Jetta's description below. I like AABC for all the reasons he doesn't like them.  Yes, they may only sell comics and toys but they do that better than anyone else. It's about quality not quantity.  He asked how they stay in business when there are so many comic stores in the valley.  The truth is the other stores are garbage. Read on\n\n(1)  They don't pilfer through the comics before putting them on the shelves. The owner even unloads the comics from the boxes right in front of you and lays them out on a glass table. So if you are guy who is trying to acquire that CGI 10.0, you will have a chance at this store. At Atomic Comics and the other stores, they go through the comics before the store opens and selectively remove the comics in the very best condition for their employees.\n\n(2) They leave the comics on the shelves longer. They are not greedy. They don't pull a comic off a shelf and mark it up a $1-$2 a week to two weeks later. They only do this if a comic is ridiculously hot which is rare. It's nice to know that you can find a comic a month after it arrived on the market selling at cover price. There is not another comic store in Phoenix that does this. Take my word for it. I've been to everyone and they pull them off the shelves quickly\n\n(3) They don't stuff their shelves and the comics are in great condition. I have been to every comics store in the valley and AABC is the only store in which the comics are consistently in great conditions on the shelves. You will not see bent corners. You won't see shelves being overly stuffed so that the first few issues and the last few issues in a stack are damaged. \n\n(4) Inventory- If its not at AABC, I go to the internet because it's not going to be at any other store in the valley.  I have too many stories of walking into other comic stores and requesting an issue and they are out or don't have it only to find 2 or 3 copies at AABC.\n\n(5) Sales: there is not another store in the valley that gives you 25% of everything in the store on Jan 1st and July 4th every year.  That includes the high priced collectors items like Incredible Hulk 181. They also have a graphic novel punch card much like a Subways sandwhich card. \n\n(6) Service: It has a mom and pop feel so you get to know the actual owners of the store. The employees actually work and are helpful if you ask questions. They are not just standing around chatting with each other like you find at Atomic Comics.  They are also humble and are not condescending. This is a great place for collectors and readers of all experience. They are also not pushy. They don't push any comics on people. I love how you can stare at comics for 45 min  in peace without someone hassling you or making you feel guilty.  They will help if you need it but they will leave you alone. \n\n(7) Ambience: I feel like I'm walking into a Comic store not a Nine Inch Nails museum.  It's colorful, clean, organized and easy to navigate. it doesn't look like some cheap strip mall store like Heroes or god forbid Stalking Moon in which it seems like some Geek bough a collection on Ebay and decided to pay rent next to some Chinese buffet and open a comics store.\n\n(8) JUST COMICS: This is exactly why I come here.  I was at Atomic Comics in Chandler and I couldn't even check out some comics because the shelf was being blocked by a card table.\n\n(9) Clientele:  Look, I'm not a typical comic collectors. I don't wear tight black shirts,  I have no facial hair or piercings, I'm not up to date on all the independent \""alternative\"" comics, I love Marvel and DC. I can't stand \""Goth.\"" Yeah,  I'm a regular guy who also happens to like comics. If you are one of these people, you will feel comfortable here.  If you haven't read comics in ages and just wanna check out the scene,  this is your place  \n\n(10) KNOWLEDGE: The employees are educated about comics but are not pretentious. Phil is a comics' genius but he isn't intimidating. Eddie is very up-to-date on all the latest indie stuff but he will tell you honestly what he thinks about an issue and if a series is worth collecting. No pushy sales people\n\nTo show that I'm not the owner and to be fair, I do think their prices can be steep and I don't always think their older items are accurately described. I also think they can charge too much for variant issues when they first arrive. Their toy prices are pretty fair and you can get steals in this <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here maybe ten times, or so, over the past ten or so years.  I've gone in a Limo with a group of, gulp, conservative couples, with \""normal\"" couples (like I set the bar), a couple of times with the \""boys,\"" and, shamelessly, by myself once (i was going through a tough time).\n\nFive dollar cover for men.  Ladies free. Drinks start at $4 and go up.  Nice bar tenders and waitresses.  Bathrooms clean, but they smell, like, well, a strip club bathroom.\n\nLots of pretty dancers.  Not bitchy.  Not pretentious.  Little boobies, big boobies, saggy boobies.  No pasties, and tiny tiny G strings.  One large area and one smaller area.  Some sort of back room, I suppose for when they rent a donkey, or some little people from the circus, but I've never seen it used.  One pool table, which I have actually played on.  They have chalk.\n\nMy wife has been here for that strange ritual they call \""girls night out.\"" and had a good time with the ladies.  Again, a harmless friendly bar, with couples, lesbians, single horny fellows...which just happens to have a couple of poles and nice women swinging around on them.  Very nice girls, even after you tell them \""no thank you\"" five times.  VERY good wait staff.\n\nNot raunchy, but one of my \""conservative\"" friends wife, from the south (duh), who ventured here with us several years ago, had a breakdown in the parking lot.  It was awesome.  Her husband was refused service because he was too shit faced to walk straight, and she was sobbing as though the FDA was going to take her anti depressive off the market.  She was disturbed that men had access to topless women so easily, as though the dancers were for \""hire.\""  FYI, don't go here with conservative 40 year old women.  Do not go here if you're afraid to see boobies, it's a titty bar.  DO go here if you want to have a light evening finisher before taking your partner(s) home for...breakfast.\n\nBring cash, I'm pretty sure even the bar doesn't take plastic.  They do have an ATM, however (that's convenient). <|endoftext|>

We held an office related function at this hidden treasure and simply had a blast.  The food was good, or at least that that I took the time to eat.   I was so enthralled in our belly dancer, plate throwing and eventual group dancing that I failed to really enjoy the food, but from what I recall it was all good.   The owner treated us all like family and made us all very welcome.   They also worked exceptionally well with our company in advance of the event and customize the evening to our group.  If you go, go with at least a small group and make a night of it!  Opa! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Rokerij, I still think you are the ish but I have to tell you, since you began serving Richardson's menu on top of yours I don't think you can handle all of this attention. We booked a reservation of 10 people and you SPLIT us up into two cubbies. Not only did you NOT warn us you were doing this but you reiterated that we were told when we made the reservation that our party was split. We weren't told in advance and that bums me out! \n\nAfter waiting 30 minutes for our split table, the service was wonderful, the food was divine, but some of the girls were in cranky moods. I jsut suggest when you have a larger party - I wouldn't leave them waiting - i know you are a super succesful and busy restaurant - but we all mattter! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sadly nostalgia doesn't make the food here any less bland. I am very generous when I dine out, and always will find something positive to end the meal. In this case the positive was that I did not have to pay for the horrendous meal. \n\nWord to the wise- if a place that serves mexican food serves you ketchup as salsa, leave immediately. \n\nMy boyfriend and I set the salsa aside and ordered the very basic machaca beef burritos. What we got was GRAY meat, with not one ounce of seasoning. \n\nAt this point we apologized to our waiter, offered to pay for the drinks and salsa, but he seemed used to this and said not to worry about it. At first he tried to say they make the meat with eggs. But saw quickly that we would not be buying that story. We did leave a nice tip for the poor guy.\n\nThis is what happens when you have uninspired people making food. \n\nToo Sad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I visited NYPD this past Saturday. I haven't been here (or it may have been the other location back then) in years since I was a kid, but had a craving for really good pizza and from what I remember, this place has great pizza. So I came with three of my cousins. We knew it was Saturday night and would probably be busy, but we went anyway. It was pretty busy so we were seated by the door which I didn't even care about since the place smelled so good. I was looking forward to getting some broccoli pizza (which very few places have) and I'm sure that would have been great... if we ever got any service.\n\nThis was really upsetting. It was pretty busy that night so we waited 10 minutes without drink orders without complaining... and then 15 minutes.. about 20 minutes into our sit-in, I notice that there were people cleaning the empty table next to ours and waiters standing around. Now that I think about it, maybe they didn't even notice that we needed service. But nonetheless, no one came and even asked if we wanted water. Eventually, we just left and had to get food somewhere else. \n\nReally disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you live nearby and are looking for a casual sports bar to watch games and drink beer, Stool Pigeons is fair enough for just that. But beyond that, total Meh. The food is not very special at all. It's mainly fried, greasy traditional bar choices and the service can be good depending on which server or bartender you get. The customer service in general is not great and I've heard several people say this. \n\nAs Anish said, the bar is good for happy hour after work because you can literally drink and eat for super cheap. Each day they also have a $4.99 lunch special. Most people who eat here during lunch only order the lunch special.. so that should tell you something about the quality of the food there.\n\nThey do have a lot of TV's and it still gets a decent crowd during football games... but it is definitely NOT what it  used to be back in the day. \n\n(Disclosure: I used to work here but this is still my honest opinion. I've held back some of my thoughts here actually.)\n\nBonus: they have a TON of good beer on draft. It's probably about 20-25 beers on tap and they change quite often. If you catch them on a special draft night then SCORE if you're a beer lover!! They also have a fun little patio and it's prime location for people watching too. <|endoftext|>

They sneer at you when you walk up to the counter to place your order. \nDon't get me wrong, the food is excellent.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was looking forward to dining at the Cajun Queen from hearing about their authentic New Orleans cuisine to seeing their Best Cajun Restaurant in Charlotte status. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable. I wish I could write about the service or the exact taste of the food but it was simply meh. I got the Blackened Catfish Filet with mashed taters (which I do remember and were fabulous) but I think they forgot the blackening on it or don't know what blackening means. I had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick.\n\nIt's a charming place however they had some live music which I personally found loud (and this moment right here is when I turned old).If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style food like I was, I would pass. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a great local Mexican joint..  modern priced, comfortable, good ritas and sangria and standard Mexican food done California style. I am from Los Angeles and there are a million of these sort of places here, so it was nice to have a local Mex place that was casual, consistently good, friendly, laid back and fun.\n\nMy faves are Tortilla Soup & Street Tacos.. \n\nI have also heard that they turn it into a Spanish club on the weekends, which is awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been here quite a few times over the year and on my most recent visit I noticed that the food and service have really gone downhill.\n\nMacayo's claim to fame is that it's founder, Woody Johnson, invented the chimichanga by accidentally dropping a burrito into the deep frier. However, as any good Arizonan knows, this claim is challenged by El Charro restaurant in Tucson where they also claim to have invented the dish in the same year.\n\nEither way, you'd think that a restaurant that wants to lay claim to such an important event in food history would make an effort to maintain its reputation as a quality Mexican restaurant, but this doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWe stopped in the other night and started with some cheese quesadillas for us and the kids and they were incredibly bland and boring. \n\nFor a main course, my wife had the steak picado and I had the green chile chicken picado. My dish is described on the menu as \""tender chunks of marinated chicken sauteed in a fiery blend of tomatillo salsa, strips of poblano chiles and habanero\"". Nowhere does it say, cooked beyond recognition so that the chicken tastes like dry pieces of cardboard.\n\nMy wife's steak picado was not tender, but tough.\n\nAdditionally, our service was inattentive when it occurred and non-existent at other times. I never received the sour cream I requested and once the food was at our table and the waitress had left behind a pitcher of water so we could do our own refills, we didn't see her again despite the fact that several members of our party had ice tea and could have used refills.\n\nIn a city and state full of GOOD Mexican restaurants, you'd think that Macayo's would try harder to compete, but I guess not. If it's my choice, I won't be back. <|endoftext|>

Chicago memorabilia on the walls the help in red white and blue ( ala cubs) t-shirts... and oh yeah!  Great Vienna hotdogs with the nuclear green relish.  I also had a two cheeseburger sliders.  Very tasty as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife, Liz is a foodie who loves to entertain. When we entertain,  she'll spend days planning, preparing, decorating the house and creating a gourmet meal. Liz's 40th birthday was approaching and I wanted her to enjoy her friends. I knew I'd have to find a caterer who could live up to her standards...or it would be a long year. Jane and team at Jumpin' Java/Bistro 160 surpassed our expectations. The food was a hit including homemade epinadas and pork sliders. They took care of everything! The decorations were a complete surprise and we couldn't stop taking pictures of the spread. Trays of champagne for a birthday toast were the icing on the cake. When Liz and I treat ourselves to breakfast and Jane's homemade strawberry jam, we are welcomed by our first names. You can't put a price on that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Will never use Wendy's Nails.  I had been going to Wendy's for about two years.  I asked for Shellac nails, a relatively new product because it was not supposed to damage nails.  They assured me it was the real Shellac, but after my nails were ruined ( breaking, peeling), they admitted it was a knock off, and they had never been trained, nor did they have the real product.\n\nI went back for a pedicure. What a horrible experience!  Half way through my pedicure a doctor's wife came in and said that she was in a hurry.  My nail tech (Ann)\nstopped doing my pedicure and started working on her so she could have a mani and pedi at the same time.  Finally she came back and did a very poor job, even forgot to cut and file my right foot.  \n\nI don't think that one's profession or marriage should make any difference in the service one receives at a nail salon.  I am a doctor - I didn't feel it was necessary to let my nail tech know what my profession is so perhaps I would get better service. <|endoftext|>

The setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food.\n\nUnfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to try it out a few times. We got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal.\n\nThe specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials. We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board. This tends to say that a place can do fish.\n\nOur server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while. This is a huge pet peeve for me. If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations. Show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff.\n\nWe ordered the White Bean Bruschetta to start. It was edible but lacking in flavor, maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt, but something more than just beans and toast please.\n\nNext was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on, not impressed.\n\nFinally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa. This dish started off a disaster and just got worse. First of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel. As We shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain. Not a great sign. Once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn.\n\nThis is just plain stupid. There is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees. Cook the food and then bring it out. Dont cook it at my table on the plate!\n\nUnfortunately the fish was not edible, at all. The melon salsa was horrid. We sent it back and still got charged.\n\nRokerij I want to love you. There are a lot of folks on Yelp that love you but I have to say that for food you have not impressed me. <|endoftext|>

Not going back again until they remodel their looks. <|endoftext|>

Worst pizza ever!! It was just sauce and little but of cheese. Plus I had the coupon and so they just added $10 to the price of my food so a pizza and wings was $35 all of a sudden. Horrible food!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A couple of weeks ago I found a menu for New North China on my door. First off, how long can a place be open and still be new? Anyway, I wasn't in the mood for pizza and didn't want to go out. I ordered some General Tso's Chicken, a dinner special, and a small order of house lo mein. The total was $17 and some change. I thought this was high, and was informed they have a $2 delivery charge.\n\nWhen the food arrived, I was excited for some delicious Chinese food. It wasn't delicious whatsoever. As a matter of fact, it wasn't even good. I am VERY disappointed in this. It feels like a waste of money, and I am sitting here on a Saturday night hungry. I won't be ordering from New North China again. I would recommend you look elsewhere. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends, one would assume sports bar, but not so much. And I very much liked it that way! Let's roll into a pro/con list...\n\nPros:\n-Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.\n-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal. \n-Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring.\n-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.\n\nCons:\n-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. \n-Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall. \n-No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.\n\nOverall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia! <|endoftext|>

The Yellowtail tasted fresh, and the spicy tuna roll was better than most places in town.  Our young, attractive waitress with a baby belly was great.  She recommended the Moto Wings in \""Mustard Gas\"" sauce.  It was very good and not too spicy.\n\nWe looked at the beer list, and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of brews.  Happy hours looks enticing with $3 16 oz barley pops.\n\nThis place does feel a little like RA.  However, there is no RA bad food or RA \""I'm too attractive to really work\"" waitstaff as far as I can tell.\n\nI will be back for HH and to try other food on the big menu.\n\n$25 for two at lunch. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had to argue with the cashier while ordering a kids meal. The menu clearly shows that with the kids meal you can choose apples slices instead of a toy. Instead of looking at the menu she asked another employee, who confirms what the menu shows. Instead of apologizing and making sure the change was made, she gave me a blank look and i had to make the request again. Too much to expect at a fast food joint. <|endoftext|>

The girl administering the pedicures was a sweetheart but the polish never lasted more than a week.  I agree with some of the other clients that the atmosphere was noisy or not professional at times.  I had a 4th appt and never received a confirmation call.  I decided to call to confirm and was told I should have received a call from the salon to cancel since that area of the salon had experienced a flood, and that they would call me to reschedule and that I would not lose my deal.  It's been a few weeks so I decided to call today and found out the salon has been permanently closed.  I could see this coming which is why I'm writing the review in case you ever decide to re-open you can learn from the mistakes made.  I understand you are trying to make right all the deals still out there.  Just in case I wanted to let you know that a refund for me is not necessary and I wish you all the best. <|endoftext|>

I ordered the #1 (teriyaki chicken and rice) with all white meat. The chicken was decent, if a bit on the dry side, but I didn't mind. The rice was good and sticky.  But there was merely a drizzle across the top of the bowl of teriyaki sauce. I got it to go, so when I got home and saw it, I was just disappointed. It wasn't bad, if I had ordered a dry bowl of rice with chicken on top...but alas, I won't be going back unless I am in dire straits and am out of options. It was just kinda bleh. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> you know that feeling of wanting to try something new and not wanting to settle for good-but-typical restaurants when you're visiting an area? This place does the job for a good price.\n\nfor it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.\n\nfresh ingredients, so good.\n\nMy friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.\n\nthey also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment? oh yes pls. \n\np.s. why is it so hard to spell prosciutto correctly? <|endoftext|>

I'm not a big sports fan, but this is a must-see place for those who are, as there are gigantic televisions that broadcast sports. You'll see several different sporting events at any given time.

A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went on Sat night at about 7:30pm, and place was about 30% full..somewhat worrisome for Sat night of Mothers Day weekend.  I ordered red curry with chicken and my wife ordered steamed tofu with vegetables.  They were out of the steamed tofu and so she settled for eggplant and vegetables.\nHad a glass of chard.before dinner--good price, average wine.\n\nFood came fast.  Curry dish had lots of chicken, excellent curry spice but lots of salt.  Only had carrots in it.  Menu had \""no substitutions\"" all over it--not very flexible in that area!  Her dish had the eggplant so tough she had to order a knife to cut it.  After the meal, when we complained about the eggplant, the waitress said \""I'm sorry\"".  When we asked if she couldn't do anything more about it, she then offered to take 50% of her meal.  The service overall was polite but not attentive.\nTotal bill for two entrees, one glass of wine and no dessert or appetizers was $23.00 and then they took $5.00 for the bad eggplant.\n\nIn summary: all the good reviews we had found about this operation seemed to be \""old\"" or maybe the lead chef was not there this night, because we would not go back.  Reasonable prices, ok atmosphere for a strip mall Thai restaurant, some dishes are probably excellent, but overall, not good enough service to make up for an average to poor meal experience.\n\nRob A, May 7th, 2011. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My two-star rating for Sam's Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \""southwestern.\"" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \""Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\"" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \""selling techniques\"" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My warranty company sent them to my home to replace a valve on my evaporative cooler. A guy shows up and starts working on my AC unit. Claimed there was a clog in the valve. Funny, 'cause the AC was working just fine. I directed him to the evaporative unit and he then said he would be back the next day with the part. I called the next day to find out about what time he would come and I was told they didn't know he was coming back. He did show up, tinkered on the roof a bit, came down and shoved his paper work at me, and I signed. I tried out the unit later in the evening, let it run about 40 min., turned it off and found the problem had not been solved (water continues to run after unit is turned off. Simple valve replacement.) Not only was the evap not fixed, but when I got up the next morning water was running out of the vent in my kitchen! I called and got a very rude Ken on the line who said gruffly, he would have to take care of it himself. It never happened. Ken did show up after I put a stop payment on the check I gave them. He did stop the water from running out of the kitchen vent, but never did fix the evaporative cooler. I had the same conversation with Ken 4 times. I couldn't figure out if it was Ground Hog day or just like two parrots having a conversation. It has been 28 days and I have gotten nowhere with these people. They never initiated a phone call to me, except to find out why the check was returned. Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised at how annoyed they seemed each time I called. Well, Now I am annoyed and I am DONE!!! <|endoftext|>

(This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share!) \nSo you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate, or get treated as such. \n\nNow the food does taste good, but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker, it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish! But how much am I paying for this dish! \nIt's only half a cut of the fish! \nDespite all the mastication, it is very hard to swallow! \nSomehow you finish your dish! (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer!) \n\nSo you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters \""Fave Pick\"" on desert! Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots! \nSo your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table, & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the \""you cheapskate evil eye\"" walking out of this restaurant! \n\nOh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet, $5 tip also will get you a \""are you kidin' me look as well!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointing to say the least. Was looking forward to wine, friends, conversation and a little nosh after the artwalk...what we got was surprisingly poor customer service that became downright passive aggressive (scratch the passive) after we received a pizza that wasn't to our liking. The waiter was so upset that we didn't want mozzarella cheese on our $10 goat cheese pizza that he brought out the cook to confirm. His manager then came by our table to tell us that we, the customers, should be aware that pizza is always served with mozz cheese. (Oh really astute one?) 20 minutes later the manager returned with a pizza drowining in goat cheese and we were informed that we should be happy because we were getting \""a bang for our buck\"". We felt so harassed by the wait staff because of this stupid $10 pizza that we actually feared they vandalized the food (yes, you know the feeling of wondering \""did that waiter spit in my dish\""?). We left confused by the entire experience. I would never never never never never go again and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place like the plague. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great service.\nGood food.\nI ordered something a little off the menu.  I had the chile relleno but had them add the carne adobada instead of the regular shredded beef. Turned out to be a great choice.\nI think this may be my go to place for day drinking. They have a full bar.\nMy birthday is on Saturday so it might be a great place to start the day.  \nGo! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Took the wife for a nice dinner at Capital Grille.  I love the confirmation email you get when making the reservation.  The place was a little busy and our table wasn't ready despite a reservation so we went to the bar.  Paul the bartender served us stoli doli's(sp?), their signature martini.  It was amazing.  We moved to our table and we split the calamari.  It was solid..not great...the peppers were a little much.\n\nFor dinner, I got filet Oscar and the wife had the salmon.  Both were cooked well.  We split a side.\n\nPluses - great service, great steak...minuses - waiting for table, calamari peppers, price...sides should not be double digits in price <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\n\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is fantastic!  They have supplies to suit the most imaginative of bakers!  I also feel they have great pricing.  I have seen similar items at other supply stores for up t twice the price.  \n\nThe staff is incredibly helpful too!   These ladies know what they are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Eh. The food isn't so great here. I like the combo of corn and flour tortilla chips, but that's about it. It's a fun place, but I wouldn't ever choose to go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When I called around for a yard clean-up, most of the prices were about the same so I chose Sergio's because they could come out fast.  The 3 person team arrived early this morning and before they began I inquired as to how long it would take them and if they knew what the approx. charge would be.  There was a lot of communication issues but finally the one said $95/hour.  I just let it drop as we were getting nowhere.  35 minutes after they started they rang the bell to tell me they were finished.  I asked how much and I was told $95.  I said for 35 minutes of work??  and he shook his head yes.  It would have been nice to be told that there was a MINIMUM CHARGE.  They have lost a repeat client.  There were others that had flat fees and they were less than the $95 charge!  If you use these guys make sure that the owner comes out (as I expected him to be but was not) so that there will not be a language problem or you'll be ripped off too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's fairly obvious when you see an endless line of platters on the wall highlighting those who have had 200 or more different beers... the place is popular and its regulars are very much so.  This place is about beer, pure and simple.  The food is but an accessory.  They did have a nice pretzel side with some mustard that will clean your sinuses... I recommend that dish between beers 2 and 3, just to keep your beer to food ratio in balance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am new father to a lil pup Hemingway. I went to store for some tips on crate training and received far more knowledge then I went for. Deborah greeted my pup and I almost immediately. She was friendly and with her nutritionist background we got Hemingway (french bulldog)on a new diet. He had already been having stomach issues with food breeder had advised. Days on the food and he is already eating more, and he is having less stomach issues. She also followed me around carrying everything for us since he was too young to put down. She seriously saved the day and was a pleasure talking to. I would recommend he for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It was 5th meet up for the The Breakfast Club UYE and this time Aunt Chilada's was picked. We sat out on the patio, thought why not while the weather was still ok.  Aunt Chilada's has a farm fresh breakfast menu you can order from, but they also let you order lunch if that's your thing. Another plus, they accepted reservations for breakfast. That made things so much nicer. We were a party of 10, so any time I can get a reservation in, its helpful.\n\nOne of the things I noticed was the salsa had slices olives in it, that's interesting, went well with the chips though!\n\nWith our breakfast we also were able to have items from the chocolate fondue fountain, and you be believe I had some chocolate covered strawberries, pineapple, lady fingers, marshmallows, oh and more strawberries, and this was before I even ordered breakfast! haha\n\nI have to say service was a little slow, but there was a couple of big party's at tables, who would have thought on a sat morning, this was the spot, there was even 2 parties  for Monica, that other Monica must have been cool to pick this spot haha.\n\nI ordered the egg burrito, past few breakfast clubs I have been to a breakfast burrito or 2 have been ordered so I have just been craving it! This burrito had scrambled eggs, cheese, potatoes (my top 3 favorite things in a breakfast burrito) and I added chicken to it and asked if they could throw in some jalapenos in it for me!  I wasn't expecting much other than a breakfast burrito, but when it came out I was shocked, it was a huge burrito, and had home styled potatoes, refried beans and the burrito was covered in melted cheese. I was in heaven!  I topped the burrito with salsa and cut into it! Omg it was delish! The jalapenos were fresh and perfect! This was a good breakfast burrito!\n\nIf you hadn't thought of Anut Chiladas for breakfast, you should and go give them a try! The Farm Fresh Menu has plenty to choose from. And I have to say I did see the yogurt and fruit dish, and omg it was the best looking one I have seen, fresh layered fruit, just beautiful in color, topped with yogurt and granola, it looked amazing.\n\nAgain thank you to everyone who attended The Breakfast Club!! It's always a pleasure sharing a meal with you guys! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Kind of a sketchy area and older machines (similar to the ones I had my old apartment complexes in Berkeley), but I give this place 5 stars.\n\n1.  Soap, bleach, and detergent dispenser ($0.50) each \n2.  Change machine\n3.  Regular washers for $1.50 a load\n4.  Oversize washers for $3.00 a load\n5. Convenience store right next door if you are hungry or thirsty\n6. Huge dryers $0.25 for 9 minutes\n7. THIS PLACE HAS WIFI!!!\n\nAnd the wifi is way faster than my stupid AT&T Uverse internet at home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is actually my second time at MCN, but I had stellar experiences both times. My first cut was with Sara and my second with Heather. \n\nI'm pretty particular about the way my hair is cut because I've had the same style for years now and know how I want it cut so that it grows out well. What's great about MCN is that the stylists make sure to talk to you in depth about your cut before picking up the scissors, and are great about pausing at certain points in the cut to make sure that you're happy with the way it's going. I really appreciate that, and have had great experiences with both stylists. At this point, I'm really confident in going to MCN and getting a great cut, and will definitely go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Everything tasted fine, it was just \""off\"".  The sweet and sour pork wasn't like anything I've had - the sauce was similar to orange or sesame sauces at other places.  Also, I'm pretty sure it was chicken, not pork.  The sesame chicken is tangy/sweet but again, not like the standard sesame I've had other places.  The egg rolls had good flavor but VERY greasy.  The crab puffs are good, filled with crab & onion with just a touch of cream cheese; not overpowered like others elsewhere.  The chow mein is good, a bit salty.  Although nothing was gross, we won't likely go again.  It was absolutely fresh, however, cooked to order! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wanted to like this place, but I just can't give it more than 2 stars. In my opinion, it doesn't compare favorably to some of the other places in town. If I'm in that neighborhood again I might stop in and give it another shot, but I'm not going to go out of my way. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As a Panther's fan, and a neighbor of the stadium, I'm probably a little biased here, but I like this stadium a lot. My one and only qualm that I've noticed a few other reviewers mention is the flow of people into the stadium. It's always a cluster f#$%^k going in! They either need to minimize the pat-downs, or somehow open up a few more gates somewhere.  Other than that, the views from just about every seat are good, the food choices are good, if as usual, a little pricey.  If only the Panthers were a little better, I might have found it within myself to throw that 5th and final star on top! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not cool: Putting me on hold for \""one minute\"" and forgetting about me. Also, how hard is it to have my order ready on time? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> always a good selection of clothing.  a great place to people watch too LOL <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've said on more than a few occasions that my meal of choice was the best tasting italian item Id ever tasted. I love the Alfredo dishes.... \nAnd excellent chicken Marsala! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Everytime I come here some \""customer\"" is always running out this store with a unpaid item. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.\n\nIrregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.\n\nThe pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).\n\nLori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.\n\nThe jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \""ham off the bone\"".\n\nOne other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.\n\nIf you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a great study spot with good coffee. It has a great cozy-coffee shop feel. They have a lot of power outlets and the music is not overpowering. My favorite thing to get here is the chai tea latte. The customers have this mutual understanding that it is a study spot. If you need to cram many hours for an exam kopi provides the right environment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had heard so many good things about this car wash, but I was disappointed. I drove away with waterspots and later noticed that the bird poop on my car hadn't been cleaned properly. Its partly my fault - I  should have checked, but when you're paying $23 for a car wash you should expect your car to be cleaned adequately. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this place so much. The food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied. The service is incredibly slow though, takes FOREVER to our meals! Even during lunch time when there's almost no one there.. I don't understand I always end up eating here for at LEAST two-four hours. Fish is always fresh, lobster is delicate and tasty, and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well. Clam chowder is rich and creamy-- perfect thickness! Love their salads as well. Definitely recommend this place for a date night :) pricey? Definitely, be prepared to spend at least $20/person! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great, well stocked shop with helpful, friendly staff. They have so much backstock, it's inconceivable to leave empty handed. I love this store and visit as often as possible. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Flies in this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pretty ghetto. Cash only and Mexican food for gringos, ie not good. They charge you for more chips. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow...if you are looking for a great date bar to take a lady for a fine drink and want to set the mood....this place is definitly at the top of the list for me and you would be wise to place it on yours as well.  Super dark, swanky, candles, couches,great dj and some nites they have live acoustic.  If your date is not into you by the end of the evening at this place she never will be my man.  I am pretty sure if Tiger had a mistress in Phoenix and didnt want to be seen he would take her to Merc Bar. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love the food, Karen is an excellent waitress, (the other one sucks) and I HATE THE SMOKE!  \n\nPay attention people!  Allowing smoke to drift into the building while people are eating is a VIOLATION.  I even asked the manager to put his cigarette out that he left burning in the ashtray and he just ignored me.  When I asked if they could at least shut the door while people were eating he said \""NO\"".  Sorry for ya, enjoy your fine!  \n\nPS, get a couple of new speakers for the crap radio station you play in there.  I know you can't hear too well but trust me, those have been blown for a couple years now! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pretty much what you'd expect.  Way overpriced, extremely low quality food served by not-that-bright, fake-baked girls wearing shiny nylons, big puffy socks, and the most unflattering shorts imaginable.\n\nGreat if you're a perv from '86, decidedly not great for everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  22\"" wiener, $27, meh. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A\n\nI know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. \n\nHere, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. \n\nFun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best!  They have been around a long time and have thrived when other rib places come and go. I make the long trip across town when I need a half-slab. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \n\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First visit here and they treatment me like a big-tippin' regular! Brian was the technician assigned to perform my pedicure. My dogs were in bad shape ya'll. Brian really took his time and straighten these suckers out. And I liked that he didn't try to up-sale. Brian is so personable! Ask for him! Loved the experience!!! Their prices are very affordable too! I will return for my next pedicure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First time visiting and upon entrance, I regretted not having the collection of CDs and DVDs to donate with me, but after receiving $13 Half Price offered for the 30 books* I brought in (that's 43 cents per book), I will not come back to sell anything else.  I was going to leave the books at work so that fellow readers could get enjoyment from them.  That thought gives me greater pleasure than the $13 in my hand.  (Changing Hands gave me $11 for four books just four days ago.)  Most of the books I brought had binds that weren't even broken- some were even brand-new!  I should've just taken them back.\n\n*Some of the brand-new titles I brought in: Culture Shock! (three editions- Britain, Philippines, Australia); Sara Gruen's Water For Elephants; Lahaye/Jenkins' Left Behind; Tim Lahaye's Revelations Unveiled; Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient; Alice Sebold's The Almost Moon; Lisa See's Dreams of Joy (hardback); and many more that were in very good condition. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I booked a rental through Costco Travel.....\n\nthe line was extremely long( like waiting for a ride at Six Flags).\n\nIf you prefer to use a debit card, they will slap $200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check. I think that it's the most ridiculous thing ever. \n\nI hate the fact that I didn't get to choose my car at their garage. A slip was given to me on where my rental is parked, and I had to get to it on my own; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle. I didn't like the Ford Fiesta they rented out to me. The breaks were making some sounds....AND!!! it was cherry red. I didn't like a cherry red car.\n\nOther companies gave you options and are more personal. Some even pull the car up for you, and help you put your luggage in the trunk.\n\nI like to be treated like a princess.\n\nTheir insurance is also pretty expensive. I was shell shocked and for the very first time, i drove a rental without any form of insurance. Thank goodness, the car was alright. My damage: $152 for a 6day rental. Not bad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm not a vegetarian, but this food was really excellent. We order a ton of food! I'll start with the things we didnt like so much or found odd. I didn't really like the spring rolls which tasted bitter for some reason and the fried rice tasted like it was drowned in soy sauce. It was so salty none of us could eat it but I talk to the waitress and they brought out some more that was just excellent. Also, the Sweet & Sour \""Pork\"" w/ Pineapple had really, really nice flavor but a strange chewy texture. I would order it again because the flavor was good.\n\nWe also order the Family Tofu, steamed broccoli, steamed rice, some kind of \""chicken\"" and noodles, and wonton soup. Also, we tried the cheesecake and YUM!!!  All of these were soooo freaking good... OMG! I totally crave this place now! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In other cities or other years, I could see the Barrymore getting a higher score from me. But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\n\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\n\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\n\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I recently had a work event scheduled at the Embassy Suites on 44th street, and unfortunately I was not 100% pleased with the experience. \n\nI first of all will say that the hotel itself is very nice, pretty, nice courtyard in the center, and the event room was set up well and clean. However the service was lacking quite a bit. \n\nFirst, when I got there I was the first to arrive out of my group, my event coordinator didn't get in that early and was not there to greet me or show me around, nor did anyone else bother to show me to the event room or how to get where I was going. I take that back, the girl at the front desk handed me a map and pointed me in a somewhat vague direction that didn't help much. I was told I would have easy access to the room to unload my car at, well without any employees to show me the access door I had to hoof my boxes from the parking lot around the building the long way. I did not find that back door until long after the seminar started. The room we were scheduled in was changed last minute for some reason, I believe  it has something to do with the final head count that we gave them. The room we ultimately in was a bit cramped for the number of attendees we had. \n\nI had to introduce myself to the catering manager and chef. No one came in to remove the places and trash from breakfast until almost 11 a.m. nor did they check on us. The boxed lunches weren't made right, only upsetting a few clients, but still.... I had to pop into the kitchen myself a few times and track someone down to help me. With the amount of money we were paying, it should have been perfect. For a cheap continental breakfast and a mediocor box lunch it was about $40 per head, kind of a lot. \n\nOver all my seminar went well at the hotel, but there were some behind the scenes issues that I really wish I did not have to deal with throughout the day. I wouldn't not recommend this hotel for you event, just make sure to cover everything prior to your event. Such as on sight contact, exactly how the food will be prepared, appropriate signage and whatnot. \n\n**I have not spend a night at this hotel so this review should not reflect on making overnight reservations. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stopped here while on a Sunday drive.  Tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed.  She was rude and careless.  We walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better.  Unfortunately the same lady came in and started venting about her customers.  Seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore.  Too bad because the beer was nice and cold.  Great views too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Self service for cost effective. A lot of steam rice. good!!    ,      .       .      .   +. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sandwich with a side of pretension? No, thank you.  I love a good gourmet market, but left D & D pretty disppointed the last time we went for lunch. The service was just not what I would expect, considering the price points were much higher than even Whole Foods.  The sandwich options were limited, and staff completely unhelpful.  I can not wait for A Southern Season to open in Charlotte and give D & D some competition. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.\n\nThere's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Old school diner, known for chili-dogs\n\nMost of the reviews here are on point.   We were there early so mostly had breakfast which was darned good.  I was not all that impressed with the chili-dogs frankly (sorry...pun).  \""Lost in time\"" type of diner.  Def worth a shot if you've never been. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's odd that even as superhero movies dominate the theatres, and fantasy takes over more of television, that comic book stores seem to be disappearing.\n\nPEOPLE, do you know that you can still get kids to read by giving them comics?? Boys, girls, challenged, gifted. . . like comics!!\n\nSo it is that poor old Kankakee doesn't have a legit shop and we rooted out this place for a few Easter basket goodies for a teen friend.\n\nYou have to be determined to find the location hidden at the end of the labyrinth in the groovy old 1916, copper-roofed Lincoln Building at 44 E. Main in bustling downtown Champaign.  Street signage and  visibility is Zero. Have no fear, enter the front doors and look for the tiny mounted signs to light the way.\n\nService was laid back, friendly, and helpful. Selection and pricing seemed very good to me, but we had a pretty open \""whatever-you-can-find-will-be-fine\"" kind of directive.  Would certainly recommend and return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  ughh......Ive been an LGO promoter for 10 years....no longer.  they had an excellent product when they featured tammie coe bakery goods.  the new internally baked products are just not to the same standard.......continuing the downward slide. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always good.  \n\nWe got in and out at lunch with good food and attentive service.  You can order from a special lunch menu or their full menu.  I recommend going early, as we were leaving around 12:30 and the place was getting really full. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error, but on two separate occasions I was charged twice for the same cup of coffee and pastry here. Both times I went in, and they promptly rectified it - but kind of annoying, no? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One of my favorite places to go...just lost not only my respect but my money. \n\nThey had the same sale on the same day for weeks on end. This same sale since i started going here. Never had signs, they would just come up and tell you. \nSo today when I go back again, the only thing on sale was clothes!!! \n\nAt the check the nice cashier was ringing everything up 50% off and out of no where the oldest lady of the group said no, only clothes are on sale. They disagreed and I explained to the older lady I have always been told these items were on sale on this day. \n\nThe oldest lady who was Adamant about the sale said it wasn't true. The other two ladies disagreed and wanted to give me the discount but she kept saying that sale never existed. \n\nAs I was walking away she said to the other cashier \"" that wasn't true\"". I turned around and said I will bring you back my receipts to show you I am not lying! What I won't do when I come back is spend another dime of my money. \n\nYou do NOT call your customers liars!!!! \n\nPerfect example of how you lose business and eventually...doors closed. \n\nWhen big spenders like me come in and clear your shelves, you do what it tales to keep them coming back. \n\nSo disappointed. You get two stars because you are a cause and and you have two wonderful associates who should have more power. \n\nDo your store a favor and get rid of that terrible lady. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I bought four woven shades at Home Depot on October 23, 2013 that Springs Window Fashions manufactured.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.  He make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly. I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy, brown hair, and awesome tattoos).   \n \nThe major complaint that I have with this location is when the high schools let out.  The tons of students just hang out, cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on tables and often just sit at your table.  When Arby's and Wendy's use to be open next door, the management did not put up with this loitering. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a tiny place tucked into some snazzy downtown complex. Its cheap for downtown, and the portions are generous, so I suggest getting only the smaller sizes.\n\nI had a rice and beans burrito, and they let you take one of their hot sauces to the table. I asked for something really hot, and I actually got it. This is surprising for Pittsburgh, because I've noticed overall the town is weak on spice (even the Thai restaurants). \n\nAnyway, the beans in the burrito were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the rice was also plump and lightly spiced. The place is tiny and clean, and I got in and out for under five dollars for lunch.   \n\nThis place is really a gem--its cash only though, so bring that with you.  Good find. A lot better than some of the other places higher up on the list. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband is in law enforcement and has been wanting to try an area dry cleaners to have his uniforms washed and pressed. After doing some research on Yelp, I chose to take his uniforms to Kim's Cleaners. I am not saying that our experience was the typical experience, but would like people to know how this dry cleaners handles a range of situations. \nFirst of all, the customer service was great! We were impressed by the man behind the counter. However, my jaw almost hit the floor when we received  our bill. I had my husbands two long sleeve shirts, two short sleeve shirts, and two pairs of pants dry cleaned and pressed. Many area cleaners give discounts to law enforcement officers; I did not take away a star for Kim's not giving one, but it would be nice if they would consider this option, especially since many officers frequent the same dry cleaners (although likely not this one considering the prices). My husband also wanted the sleeves on the two short sleeved shirts taken in a 1/2 inch. Our total bill was almost $60. I think the actual dry cleaning was about $20-$25 and the alterations accounted for the rest. I did not feel that the dry cleaning was worth that much. I will definitely not be bringing anything else here. I would recommend others to check the price when you drop off your clothes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wanted sushi and was willing to drive my friends to PV for Yasu Sushi Bistro (highly recommended by me!) but they were too tired and wanted something within a block or two of the Hyatt. \n\nThey asked the concierge, who recommended this place as very good! \n\nHas she ever had good Mexican food, or is she getting kickbacks?\n\nThe Matador Restaurant is across from the Hyatt Hotel, in the center of downtown. It has been in business since 1976, is large, and IMO, \""Bleh\"".\n\nIt is owned by a Greek Family for one. All 32 years. All the Mexican dishes and specialites were mostly from one of their first cooks. Great, make your cook create all the recipes for authentic dishes and you make all the money. There is even a small Greek section of the menu which offers low end Greek dishes (Gyros Sandwich, Gyros Plate, Greek salad, Feta Cheese plate, and something called Shrimp a-la Mike!)\n\nThe menu has print so small, only a search light and magnifying glass can decipher it. \n\nThey do have some authentic dishes, like menudo, carnitas, lengua con chile verde; and the basics like enchiladas, tacos, tamales, tostadas, chimichangas, carne asada, chalupas, fajitas and flautas. \n\nThey bring you chips and two types of salsa. We ordered (extra) guacamole, and it didn't taste or look very fresh, like they mixed a jar of paste with a couple of avacadoes. The Margaritas were uninspired and weak. \n\nI tried the Machacas (sauteed shredded beef) which was moist but lacked flavor, and was supposed to be with green chilis, tomatos, and onions with rice and beans for $10.95). 3 others in my group were unimpressed with the food, and they were French Canadien (So what do they know about Mexican food, except when it isn't good!).\n\nThey also have steaks and chicken dishes, but why bother? \n\nThe food was passable but would not entice you to come again, unless you got drunk at a ball game at the local Chase Field stadium and were starving. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'll try to be objective here. So disclaimer first, I would prefer a bar with a small dance floor over a large club with seizure inducing strobe lights any day. Yes guys, there are plenty of young girls here. It isn't difficult to find several packs of half-drunk girls to grind on, and if you lack confidence to approach at least the bartenders are gorgeous. This is the perfect place to find someone to take home, and it's so loud you don't have to worry about all the dumb things you say. Truthfully though it's just not my scene. I don't won't to sound pretentious, but this place feels dirty and you will most likely step in vomit or at least spilled beer. As others have said, it's mostly hip-hop, when I was there I rarely heard any house or trance. The crowd definitely trends younger, mostly in their teens or low 20s. I'm 25 and I almost felt too old there. But maybe that says more about me than it does Bar Charlotte. For that reason, I can't give this place less than two stars. Just know what you're getting into, it's your typical teenage get drunk and go nuts kind of club. That could be just what you're looking for. But the $15 cover on a Friday night is steep, and for me it just wasn't worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am at Food Glorious Food every weekend. I always try to sample something new every time I go, and everything I've had has been wonderful.\nThe cupcakes are so buttery and the fillings and frosting so creamy (and sweet, but not over the top sweet). The fruit tarts are also excellent-- my favorite is just topped with a very generous amount of cream and and assorted fruit (berries, kiwi, mandarin orange, etc). Ahh, soooo good.\nI haven't tried the focaccia (yet) but they look incredible. And I ALWAYS get a biscuit. Every time.\nThey recently expanded their hours, and are now open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And they will take orders by phone. So if there is something you want that is a popular item, you can call and they will hold it for you until you get there! \nThe line can be long but the staff is very efficient-- I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Husband and I needed bikes.  Why?  Well, to ride to Luci's, of course!  And how else would you take a ride to your favorite local coffee shop, but in a darling cruiser-type bike purchased from a cute little local bike shop?  The service and selection at Sun Cyclery were top-notch.  Adam was incredibly helpful on each of my (count 'em) 4 visits when deciding which bike to purchase.  Since looks were my main criteria for choosing a bike, he made sure that I could deck out my new ride with a wicker basket and shiny bell.  Does it get any better than that?  I love love love my bike (as does the Husband) and just can't wait until the weather is suitable for showing off ... ahem... riding once again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\"" is a good size for an individual pizza.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of the best places in Charlotte for continual live music. Open since the mid-70s the Double Door inn has hosted a ton of top acts and is always full of people who love music. Charlotte isn't known nationally for its music scene but with venues like this, it is hard to deny that you can't have a great time with Charlotte music. Decent beer selection and regular visits from the legendary Bill Hanna (at least legendary for Double Door Inn visitors) solidify the Inn as a location for musical bliss any night of the week. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We used Creations In Cuisine Catering for a Christmas/Holiday party for our work.  They were spectacular.  The food was amazing, the setup, the employees, everything was immaculate.  I didn't hear one bad thing about them from anyone at the party.  Actually, most of our employees wanted their name so they could use or refer them in the future.  \n\nThe quality of food was unsurpassed.  The appetizers and dinner were out of this world.  \n\nThe staff and chefs were amazing.  They were so nice, helpful and attentive.  \n\nI would highly recommend if you are looking for a caterer in the Phoenix area that you give them a call.  We were not disappointed and will definitely be calling them again in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Last night I introduced my friends to my fianc\u00e9. It took me a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for us all to get together for some wonderful food and drinks. I remembered going to Havana Cafe before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so finally decided that would be the spot. Sadly, this time around it wasn't very impressive. My drinks were verrrrrry weak, my food was not flavorful or even displayed in an appetizing manner. The appetizers and dessert were good, but not amazing. I'm not sure why last night was different, but it was different enough to ensure that I probably won't return. That makes me sad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So, they're good for a few things when in a pinch.  Problem is, tags are always mislabeled, they don't stock most items, they're over priced, and they have the worst return policy I have ever seen.\n\nI have a theory that amazon purchased best buy years ago, and made them really crappy so that people would just shop at amazon.\n\nI am just going to buy what I needed on amazon and do same day delivery - which is free during the Christmas season, and have what I need tomorrow afternoon. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have them such a glowing review before. \nI am really disappointed.\n\nEven though my first customor service rep was wonderful, this time I got a really rude lady named Tracy.  I just did not like the way she talked to me so much so that I just didn't even book a second trip.\n\nThere are so many competitors and the economy is not great right now.  Companies cannot afford to have the worst customer service.  I did call  Detours.  They were quite helpful. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yikes! I take back my last updated review. They changed ownership and it's NOT good. :( \n\nNo more wait service. Instead you awkwardly order at the counter.\n\nPrices have gone up drastically! \n\nPretty much the same menu but it tastes different. Not nearly as flavorful. My sushi roll was quite sloppy. \n\nNo booze! Booooooo. Supposedly they are waiting on a liquor license but if I had a buzz I probably would have been much more forgiving of the experience. \n\nI will still give them 2 stars because the counter guy was nice and the food was edible. But it was a bad experience... Usually when my husband and I hit up their happy hour we pay under $25 for tasty nibbles and a few alcoholic beverages. This time our bill was almost $40 for similar items but not as tasty but without the booze and without table service. Boooooooo! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had dinner on a Monday night. They weren't real busy. We had called 4 hours earlier to get a table for 12. They were not set up for us when we arrived. The dining area was about 25% full but they had to take 15 minutes to put a table together, by the fireplace. We had to have them turn the fireplace off as it was too hot.\n\nDrinks ordered and it took another 15 minutes to get any of them to our table.\n\nI tried to order Huevos Rancheros which is not on the dinner menu. Other mexican restaurants will normally make this. Not Aunt Chilada's. The waiter said the chef would chew him out if he took any special order to the kitchen. Again, they were not busy and they have Huevos Rancheros on their weekend breakfast menu.\n\nI've eaten at this restaurant before when visiting Phoenix. This was by far the worst experience of all from the service to the food and just the general attitude about us as customers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have visited this bar several times and must say I'm a big fan of this bar.  It is your average sports bar, with average drink prices.  Their bar food is out of this world.  Don't believe me?  Try the pizza rolls, buffalo chicken rolls, or wings.  Or all three.  Seriously.\n\nStopped there in the daytime once however to pick up some of the aforementioned deliciousness, and was put off by their carpet in the morning.  If you've had a bit to much too drink, don't stare at the carpeting while making your way to the loo.  You might fall over.  \n\nBeen here to watch some Phillies games before and even though the bartender was a Yankees fan, it was still a nice experience.  I will definitely go back to this place in the future. <|endoftext|>

You can go on a tour, ride the camel, go on the slides (which is really expensive because it's $3 per ride going down a slide), get up close with the giraffes and even get up close with the elephants.\n\nGood place to take the kids and spend an entire day there.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  About what one would expect from a conglomerate fast food chain as far as the food quality goes, but what was especially remarkable today was the very poor customer service. I sat outside, and when the employee brought my lunch out and did not bring a fork, she acted almost joyous that she got to tell me that I have to go inside to get my own fork. She will have no future in customer service I'm sure of that.\n\nThis was at 2:30 on 11/2/13. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't see to many options in Pittsburgh for sporting goods. Dick's seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I never really considered writing a Yelp review for UIUC, but after seeing some of the ludicrous negative reviews, I'd like to voice my opinion.\n\nMost importantly, for those individuals who may be considering the University for their higher education needs, know that it is an excellent place of learning, especially for engineering and the sciences.  \n\nI don't think it's fair or accurate to claim that there is nothing to do in Champaign or that it is devoid of the cultural richness of cities like Chicago.  If you asked many of my college friends, they may take the position that the best thing about the C U is the drinking, but I would contend that people who take that position have never left campus or spent time trying to find something to do with their time.  There are lots of things to do and places to spend time that don't involve drunk undergrads.  And, you'll get a quality education at a good price (even though tuition keeps going up). <|endoftext|>

Took my wife for Sunday brunch here last summer and it all went horribly wrong. Bad table, bad snooty waitress, disconnected Scottsdale dude who managed the place went through the motions when we walked out prior to getting our main courses. I have never been made to feel like I wasn't welcome somewhere by a server until that time. I told the waitress (who was the cause of 90% of our bad experience) that we were not staying to continue to be treated like this. She suddenly became very worried we were going to \""tell\"" on her. It didn't matter much anyway because as soon as I started telling the space-case manager what was wrong, he didn't even let me finish my first sentence before trying to buy my silence with gift cards, etc. I know they are a great looking restaurant and they have good food, but you are NO better than the people you serve, so remember that. Tip: Houston's has  nearly the same menu. <|endoftext|>

In fact, I was astonished to find that I hadn't written a review of the place yet.  So here goes...\nFirst off, the food is served cafeteria style.  I know this turns many people off, but if you give the place a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.  As I said earlier, the food is quite good.  My favorite is \""The Straw\"".  It contains mounds of hot pastrami, melted Swiss, and sauerkraut.  You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll.  If you like corned beef, try \""The New Yorker\"".  It's similar to \""The Straw\"" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.  A typical lunch will set you back $10-$11, but most people can make 2 meals out of the sandwich.  File this one under my \""Best Lunchtime Eats!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food has no taste.  I went here for my birthday because we saw it on TV.  I have no idea how anyone can give this place a good rating.  If you like tasty food please go somewhere else.  Not even my 3 year old son liked it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-\n\nI and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party, just one hour before lunch, told that they did not get the \""PANEER/cheese\"". They can substitute it for \""MALAI KOFTA\"". It was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / \""PANEER\"" entree. On the other hand the \""MALAI KOFTA\"" was just \""POTATO\"" in the gravy. The quality of food in this party was awfully bad. \n\nThis is a humble request to all INDIAN Americans and all NON-INDIAN Americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. We are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. You can confirm these details with me anytime, I am engineer by profession. I was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but I am lucky to get an experience before hand. I will NEVER NEVER recommend this place EVER. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I go to this place about once a month for lunch and I am consistently impressed with the quality of my meals and the service. It seems like an unassuming cafe, but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly and engaging.\n\nUsually, I will get one of their sandwiches and I am especially impressed with their chicken parmesan panini. It's obvious that the ingredients are fresh and the bread is homemade. It's the kind of meal I would expect in an New York bistro, but it is right here in Pittsburgh. \n\nOverall, this is a great restaurant if you like fresh ingredients and good Italian food. Also, the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I guess this is why I always go to the Good Egg on Central. It is always packed so I decided to try this one. It was quiet inside....no surprise. Food was decent. Service sucked. Took forever to be acknowledged for seating. Then the waitress just continued to disappear over and over again. If we needed anything...ketchup, fork, check, etc forget it. We had to flag down another waitress to go find ours and she would eventually show up with yet another excuse. Back to Central we go! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> as a suscriber to the Blumenthal, there is always some great entertainment at this venue in its several concert/symphony halls. Highly recommend for dates and time with friends! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's not often I feel the need to rush home to post a review for a place I have just eaten.  But I am in a breakfast bliss thanks to this place.  \n\nMoving to a different part of town is difficult, especially when it comes to things like finding all new places to eat a inexpensive yet great breakfast on the weekends. Alas, the Peoria Cafe is too far away for a Saturday morning breakfast run, so a new \""hole in the wall\"" was needed. I refuse the \""popular\"" standards such as IHOP and Denny's, and I was worried that there might not be a suitable spot nearby.\n\nThank God for Yelp! The reviews were mostly good for this place, which was only a few miles away, so thought I would try it.  Everyone said to expect a line, but I got lucky and grabbed a spot at the counter right away. Ordered something simple; eggs and bacon with hash browns and toast. OMG, the bacon, the bacon.  It was incredible, the thickest, most wonderful bacon I have eaten in a while.  Hash browns were crispy (not greasy) and eggs, well are eggs.  I can't wait to bring all my family here when they visit! \n\nONe thing though, when people say it is small, they are not kidding.  Even after reading that, I was surprised how small it was.  There are about 15 tables packed in there, and that's it. One of the waitresses was talking about 2 guys sitting at a table talking for over 3 hours - don't be rude, go somewhere else and catch up.  Make room for someone else to sit down and let your waitress earn a living. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been buying gas, details and car washes at various Danny's for 7 years while putting up with their never ending requests to fix my windsheld every time I go in.  \n\nToday was the first time that I needed to ask for a raincheck car wash after getting one last Saturday right before the duststorm.\n\nApparently you have to go in 72 hours after your car wash, NOT get rained on within 72 hours, which effectively makes the guarantee useless. Its been impossible to get in all week.\n\nAfter all the money I've spent with them, which they clearly track via license plate, it was a big let down from a customer loyalty standpoint, enough to the point that I doubt I'll go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you're into family-style seating with strangers, limited menus, not having a drink with your meal, and small portions with large price tags, it's perfect.\n\nI hope to go back when they have their liquor licence; that'll give it at least one more star (depending on how many drinks I have ;) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  AZ Hiking Shack did not adequately stand behind their product, in my view.  \n   I bought a backpack at the AZ Hiking shack and the pack messed with my back really badly, causing me to have to go to a physical therapist, it seems, for months of therapy. Early on in this re-healing, I went to take the pack back to get a refund. They would not stand behind the product and give me a full refund. \n   The pack was in great shape. I had cleaned it by using a dry terry cloth to take off a little dust, and visually, I could not tell it had been used. I brought all the tag material that came with the pack too. I had spent $269.00 plus tax for the pack and all they would give me is $100.00. I could not believe this! I appealed to the owner and he upped it to $125.00. I told him this was outrageous, that REI or Summit Hut would stand behind their products, and that I would have expected them to also. \n\n   I would never shop there again, with this poor service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The place smells awful.   Its non-smoking, but reeks of stale smoke, and when I spend 1/2 an hour there, I leave smelling like smoke.  This isn't an isolated incident, but it really smells every time I've been in there (at least once a month for the past couple years).\n\non the up side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is my third visit and my last. The drive through is always slow. today after 5 mins waiting I honked horn and talked to the speaker. nothing. At 8 mins tried again. Then left. As I drove by I could see 5 to 8 people inside playing around not doing their jobs. so off to Wendy's across the street. They were super fast, courteous, and we're happy to be doing their jobs. So very unlike the horrid sonic that we will never return to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The appearance and cleanliness of this place is really nice, however there isn't hardly any variety what so ever for there buffet. There is one table of food and that's it and most of there food was cold and tasted exactly like those canned foods that you buy at the grocery store. Price is outrages for what they offer as I went to golden corral with my spouse, and spent the same amount, exact same and got a ton and I mean a ton of options, and best of all there food tastes great! Sadly I do not and would not recommend this place to anyone. If you are looking for a buffet try golden corral or the mandarin, but don't be lured in by the appearance of this Indian place as you will leave disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of the only Starbucks I've seen with the swamp misters outisde. Pretty cool. They had some good jams playing inside as well and the gentlemen behind the counter had a strong southern accent, so obviously this is my new favorite place on Earth. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Did not live up to the hype.\n\nWe went looking for those \""intelligent\"" dog toys... you know, the puzzle type deals where they have to figure it out to get the treats. They listed about a dozen of them on their website.\n\nThe girl at the front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down, because we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go \""Ma'am? Ma'am?!\""  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me \""ma'am\"", I'm only 21, dammit!)   \nWhen I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. \n\nAside to the owner/managers:\nDear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.\n\n(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). \n\nThe place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).\n\nThe prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. \n\nThere were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.\n\n80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).\n\nTo top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.\n\nWe left with the \""Dog Tornado\"" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle... Le sigh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bad service. Waiter was rude and obnoxious.  We never got refills on drinks or salsa. The menus were sticky. Fajitas came out w literally one tablespoon of cheese..we live in Wisconsin! !! The chimichangas were on point though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The owner of this restaurant, Elliot, is extremely rude and has a lot to learn about the value of customer service.  He participated in the Entertainment Book program but refuses to accept their coupons and is rude to his patrons.  I used to be a \""regular\"" but now, will never step foot in there again.  Elliot lost a good customer - I wouldn't recommend Wagon Yard to anyone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The Good--Dr Day is well educated, very capable, and instills confidence that in his patients that your procedure will be completed successfully.  Also they can get you in quickly for your initial visit and follow-up visits. \n\nThe Bad--he took out all four of my wisdom teeth, and I had to make two more visits for him to finish the job and get the remaining shards out.\n\nThe Ugly-- He's very arrogant, his professionalism is subpar, and he's insulting to his patients at time. \n\nWhen I came in the last time for him to remove the last part of the tooth he missed the previous two visits, he rubbed some ointment on the area to numb it. So as he comes towards my mouth with what looked like pliers to \""snip\"" the tooth off, I asked if there was going to be any local anesthesia, his reply was the ointment was good enough and to \""stop being a wimp\"". I was kind of shocked but knowing he's got these pliers in my mouth, I figured I'd laugh it off. Well then when he poked the side of my cheek with the pliers trying to get to the tooth, I kind of flinched. Woops, my mistake! He slings the pliers and mirror onto the tray, tells the assistant to get a local, and storms off. \n\nI had read reviews on another website of Dr. Day and they pretty much said the same thing. But I figured, i'd give him a shot anyway as my situation is a little more complicated that impacted, adult wisdom teeth. I don't regret going to him, but I can't recommend him. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've now flown through here a couple of times for business in Charlotte.  It's a nice airport, decent places to eat/snack, etc.  I've not had any problems flying in our out.\n\nThe airport is pretty clean and, while car rental requires a shuttle, it's a quick shuttle ride and the shuttles are frequent.\n\nThey do have free wi-fi but, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to connect...you have to wait through a stupid AOL advertising video.  Really?  AOL?  you have got to be kidding, right?\n\nOne very odd thing...they have bathroom attendants.  Yes.  Really.  In every restroom there is an attendant who hands you paper towels to dry your hands and goes around keeping the bathrooms clean.  They are VERY clean, some of the cleanest I have ever been in for an airport.  But, then you feel guilty because you should really tip these guys.  But, I usually don't travel with much cash, so, I didn't have any money for a tip....sad <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  DISAPPOINTMENT NAMED SALAD.  I've been going to Houston's for 23 years (I started young) and I've been getting the same dish EVERY single time.  Why?  Because it's great EVERY single time.  Never have to worry.  Except this time.\n\nI usually split the salad with someone along with the artichoke dip.  Dip = great.  Salad = Worst.  When did we change it up and add corn?   And the portion was the size of a side salad.  Side salad?  Really?  Are we that pretentious Hillstone?  And never mind about mentioning the difference of proportion to your waiter.  It doesn't go anywhere.  Which was another first.  \n\nAll in all, a Debbie Downer of a meal at the sorta new Houstons. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They just lost my money cause no one would ask if I needed help. Waste of my time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I try to go here for lunch at least once a week. I believe it is the best lunch spot in the strip if not Pittsburgh. It's so good that it actually makes me smile thinking about it. I get the smoked salmon salad or the spicy thai wrap. I keep telling myself to branch out but they're such perfect lunches. Their cookies are delicious too. And the lady at the cash register is really nice! Absolute A+ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Found this on Yelp & decided we HAD to come check it out. I'm a huge fan of chicken fried chicken, I know everyone said this was known for the steak but I figured they would both be great.  I was correct! Our server & all other staff we came in contact with was super sweet. Our food came out piping hot exactly how we ordered it. Huge pieces of chicken, my husband & I could of easily shared it. Only complaint was the breading fell off of every piece I would cut. Eh. Oh well. We will def be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This airport has the nice walkway that have the nice trendy monitors that enable you to display announcements.  You can now display the names of the individuals you are looking for in addition to paging them.  They also provide the 1 quart plastic bags for you if you should have any liquids in your carry-on that you forgot about.  They also supply the hospital like footies so that you didn't want to be walking around in your socks or barefoot you would have a covering.  This airport seems to have the money....  The pick up area is slightly confusing because there is a South Side, and I'm not sure which side that really is...  If you are looking at the sign does it mean that it's the area in front of or behind that is the South Side area?!  There are the inner lanes where people can pick you up, and the outside lanes are where the buses and shuttles are located   This is the opposite of O'Hare and Midway where the closer lanes are for limo and bus and taxi pick up.  My friend picked me up on that side and the parking police was honking at us.  At least we didn't get ticketed.  It's interesting how each terminal has an arrival and departure ramp, as opposed to separating the arrivals and departures.  I really like how the seats at the airport terminals do not have arm rests.  I notice these things now, should I happen to have a layover I can spread out and lay on a few seats for more comfort.  They have a decent amount of restaurants as well.  I'm not sure if all the gates have a simllar set up and variety of restaurant vendors, but was the case for Gate A. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I walked in and asked one question and the clerk was unwilling to help and was also rude. It's worth driving the extra few blocks to hinkleys. As a manager of a retail store myself, this is a horrible way of handling customers and I doubt this place will be in business much longer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a fantastic hotel.  I went to a convention here at the end of June and loved the setting.  The convention center is well setup and the link between the hotel and the convention center works really well, especially if it's raining.\n\nMy only complaint is that the elevators are slow during busy times. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Of course driving by the name caught my attention, so why not!? After checking in with some adventerous friends, I noticed the placed lacked in reviews and thought I'd be the first, but leave it to those experienced Elite to lead the way! The place was small and lacked in an abundance of  love toys as the name implies, they did have plenty of cute outfits, and costumes ranging in sizes from small, super small to Xtra small and some  super high heels that would challenge even the most experienced of dancers! Prices seemed affordable for even the average \""working girl\"" , but don't worry guys they had costumes and colorful undercarriage for men too! Although they did advertise great deals on DVDs it was the outdated VHS tapes and reading material that caught my attention, ! No purchases were made, I've seen and experienced better and after a crack of the whip we were off to find our next adventure... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house, this location and the one at Lawyers & Margaret Wallace both argued as to which location was supposed to deliver to us! We didn't feel like leaving the house last night and decided to give them another chance. They were 20 minutes late, the pizza and wings were cold, and the customer service was terrible! I will not be ordering from this place again. I am really surprised this location has been in business as long as it has. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place for family and friends to enjoy. Comfortable, great atmosphere and good service. Plenty of TV's to watch your favorite sports. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This food is amazing! It's heavy but so delicious! I love chicken fried anything from here. The brisket is also so good. The Gravy is awesome. Most white gravy doesn't have a super strong taste but its definitely not bland like others have said. The best part are the lunch prices! $8 for a huge piece of chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes , corn and a biscuit! They even have lunch prices on Saturday. Yes it's cluttered but I don't rate based on decor unless its dirty which is a different story. It doesn't bother me but like I said I'm not the type of person who lets decor decide if I will return or not. The service varies, sometimes its awesome sometimes it's so so. I've never had bad service here. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was there ribeye because they dot use tenderizers or seasoning which I love but other than that it wasn't bad, I just prefer my steak seasoned and tenderized. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been to this noodle cafe many times and love love their Ramen. Their TanTanMen is very good and very hot. I like their Shrimp Shumai too.  The sushi is OK but I don't go there for that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here for my husband's birthday and they have a very nice outdoor seating area. I wasn't a huge fan but my husband loved it and compared it to being on the same scale as Eleven so that's why it gets a 4 star rating. \n\nWe ordered the korean barbeque ribs $12) which fell off the bone and the calamari with chilies, toasted garlic, mint and an uni emulsion ($9). \n\nMy husband had the seared rare tuna - sesame crust, korean bbq, kim chi, cucumber-red onion  salad, ginger fried rice and peanuts ($34) which he loved. I had the spicy basil noodles with broccoli, onion, button mushrooms, baby bok choy, orange peel, sesame seeds and fried egg ($17). I ordered it spicy but found it to have a strange taste. \n\nFor dessert we had the frozen cashew terrine which had chocolate ganahce, mango-rasberry coulis and candied cashews for $8. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For a Subway.. This is the best one I have been to. It's right by my office, so I have only been there during lunch time. The staff is awesome. I am always greeted when entering. The workers are fast, and get your order right every time. One of their employees during the lunch shift seems to keep it all together. He manages the other employees well ,and is extremely friendly. Not sure what his name is.. but someone needs to give the black dude with the earrings a big raise. As far as Subway goes, this one is the best- <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've revisited this Menards countless times over the past few months. Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \""No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\"" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn't have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \n\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I both had terrible experiences here. Gus' attitude is - well special. If you can handle it great - otherwise why should anyone have to deal with it. After all aren't we the customers?  The prices are outrageous...\nAND finally - i had 2 dresses that I entrusted to them for adjustments. Let's say - they are both COMPLETELY unusable. Why? well, my butt is nearly exposed on one of the dresses. (not exaggerating). And the other - is terrible.....\n\nI would not recommend them to anyone... very very truly disappointed as I could use a good honest knowledgeable helpful tailor./ seamstress.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  *For the bar\n\nWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.\n\nJust getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.\n\nI browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. \n\nIt was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.\n\nI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9.\n\nIt appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Oh for the days when the funny guy with the mustache was making the donuts fresh for us! I had an issue with this location limiting the menu selection on a prepaid discount offer, I contacted the corporate office and was reminded that their locations are all franchised. So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This Starbucks is in a strip mall at the bottom of Greentree hill and unfortunately has the unlucky fortune of being a hangout for the most obnoxious group of men who come into the store early in the morning, nurse a cup of coffee all day, take up all the chairs, and gobble up all the free samples of pastry that the baristas offer. It's really a shame too because this Starbucks has a fireplace with a nice fire working during the cold months. In the evening when the old man unemployment club leaves is a great time to visit. If not for the \""I can top that\"" club that come in everyday and tell the same old stories over and over IN SUCH LOUD VOICES, this would be one of my favorite Starbucks in the Burgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We lost a legend of deli's and it is replaced with a somewhat chain restaurant called So we MEAT again. The sandwich left much to be desired, the bread was mediocre and the thinly sliced piece of cheese on my sandwich brought a tear to my eye. The kabanosy sausage tasted over processed but a bit tasty with all the garlic inside, but the after taste was not pleasing. I may make the trek to the Stanley's on Bell road but was hoping this place was the birth of the rumored Stanley's that was supposed to branch into 7 new stores. I can't say that I would return to this shop as it was not terrific. There was mention of European goodies like stuffed cabbage and some other dishes during the holidays but is this not the holidays? Turkey day is 3 days away? If I do return here it won't be for a sandwich but maybe some cold cuts, smoked butt and during the holidays. The young lady behind the counter said that Stanley's shared their recipes with them but the menu states that these are passed down through generations of Shannon's deli with no mention of Stanley's. Maybe when they get the smokehouse in the back of the building going they will offer the 60+ unique cuts they promise. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\n\nThe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  And, its not good.  Some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\n\nThe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  They do have a good selection though.\n\nThis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Service here is always friendly, and it's a pleasant place that offers a lot of fish for the buck. Go for fish over lobster or shrimp, as you get more food for the buck, and it tastes good going down. Plus, salsa bar! They've added dessert, and the coconut-lime bars are really good. Not so good is the sangria, which has a strange cardboard background taste.\n\nWhy two stars? Well, it doesn't taste so good coming back up. Five hours later, it all did, and the problem lasted for 24 hours. That matches food poisoning with that meal as the source. It's too bad, as I enjoyed the meal while it was happening, but this is a risk I wouldn't take again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> CLT you are always clean and pretty and fabulous! The bags are usually up in a reasonable amount of time, no issues ever. Joy was the day CLT turned non-smoking! \n\nI love the Shuttle Personnel who never want you to wait for a shuttle. Both long term and short term parking shuttles wait at the same spot. If the CLT Parking Attendant sees you waiting, they will always come over and make sure the short bus you need is on the way! Thanks guys!! You are super duper!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Beware of these apartment complex they are the worst of the worst. I lived there for a year a whole year I can't even believe I actually survived and I mean that literally. The only way I survived was practically because I mainly just came home to sleep. So where do we begin? Mmmm... Starting of by appearance the apartments look run down old and there is cockroaches and bed bugs I was constantly having to put heavy chemicals just to keep those nasty bugs away. One day when it rained our 2 bedroom ceiling started leaking I had to put buckets to catch the water and on top of that Managment took 3 weeks to come and actually look at the damaged caused by the rain. Next is couple situations that happend here, I lived on the third floor (the last floor) the very first one at ground level lived a older man that I never got to meet but, basically after complaining for over 2 weeks about little red bugs what looked like fruit flys taking over our apartment, we come to find out this older person was dead for over 3 weeks it was crazy!! Police and what looked like CSI in white zipped up suits were all over that apartment it was scary. Another thing about these apartments are constantly scared for my life situations all from people fighting, shootings, drunk fights, 2 episodes with child protective services taking kids away, home robberies, car theft, possible prostitution (I say possible because there was men coming in and out of this girls apartment but, I didn't actually witness the prostitution happening but seriously what else could it be), and drug dealers! Oh almost forgot one of the apartment caught on fire!! I really can go on and on about these apartments. Don't let the cheap rent convince you! My husband and I were going through a really rough time financially and that's how we ended up here, but I will never ever go back and I for sure DON'T recommend living here you couldn't even pay me!! Staff is very rude and don't care about your safety. If I could I would rate a negative 0 lol! I wish I could tell you everything in detail about this horrible awful place but, it will take too long. When you see these apartment complex run as fast and far as possible and don't look back I'm trying to save your life. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ok, I'll admit, Phoenix has terrible BBQ.  If I were to rate Honey Bears in relation to other BBQ restaurants in the city, it'd get higher.  But this ain't no relative rating, and Phoenix needs some better BBQ.  So I'll continue.\n\nIf you like a sorry excuse for BBQ, this is it.  Meat tastes completely flavorless and dry save for the Memphis-style sauce.  Meats are not smoked, and I'm doubting whether they are actually even barbecued.  When you walk in, there is no aroma of BBQ, just meat.  Almost if they were oven cooked.\n\nMemphis style BBQ should be rubbed and smoked.  Meat should have a faint smoke ring and outside should be distinctively seasoned compared to the inside.  The sauce here is good and is a must to keep the food edible.  Sides are completely forgettable.  I gave Honey Bears 2 stars because the prices are good. \n\nFor those who think BBQ needs to be doused in sauce to be good, well, that's your opinion but contrary to popular belief the sauce should be a compliment to the already good seasoning of the meat.\n\nIn short - still waiting for a real BBQ restaurant.  This ain't it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Young lady that served me was busy chatting (about nothing related to work) with another male coworker, so i had to wait to order til she was done chatting. She kept talking to him as she took my order, barely acknowledging i was standing there. I asked her for honey mustard, she didnt even hear me. She handed my receipt and card back without even looking at me or saying thank you,  still talking to the coworker.  I still wanted honey mustard, so finally I said Excuse me, to which she replied, Huh? I repeated myself and she says they will help you with sauces down there when you pick up your order.\n\nI went to the other end, they threw my chicken fingers in a bag and folded it, never asking me if i wanted any sauce at all. And no thanks or nothing. \n\nI was hoping the chicken fingers would at least be good, but no such luck - they were dry/hard and not good at all. Buyers remorse set in, but it was now 10pm and everything else in the airport was closed. \n\nNot going back to this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We had a few cocktails here during a rained-out event they put on with the Young Affiliates of the Mint Museum. The venue was very trendy and relaxing. I enjoyed the furniture and thought it was a great spot to grab a nice glass of wine or a cocktail. You're in such a fabulous location in the middle of everything and I can imagine the view is quite nice when it isn't so crowded.\n\n I am not sure if they were solely in charge of food, but my one complaint is that it was very sparse at an event featuring quite a bit of wine directly after work. The event  flyer specifically mentioned food so that was a bit of a let down as I was definitely hungry towards the end. Overall they handled the rain situation smoothly so they get kudo's for that! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food was overpriced and not that great. Slow service wouldn't even refill my drink. Interior is dingy and the tables were sticky I would not recommend this place. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, I agree...never again with Hertz at CLT airport.  20 min wait for shuttle followed by huge lines and 2 clerks at off site location.  Then we went out to find a car with dents and scratches and no one wanting to document the damage.  Guy walking around cars said person at gate would do it as we left and then \""...ita\"" at the gate nastily told us that was not her job.  Her comment was to document it myself and then she would date stamp it.  SO I wound up walking around and writing down all the damage and photographing the car while everyone trying to leave waited.  There was NO way I was going to leave without documentation that I wasn't the one that made all the damage.  I'm sure they would have become very efficient then!  I was Totally disappointed in Hertz.  I thought they were better than this experience illustrated! <|endoftext|>

I get the same BS everytime I go. \""Your truck is too big\"" So,they measure the tires and it's all good, but always a hassle. I stopped going because they try to scam me for an EXTRA $25 dollars to wash my F150... Enough is enough.. I'll take it somewhere else.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very professional. The quote they gave was very reasonable. My house stays warmer now in the colder weather, and is even cooler when it is hot. My utility bills have gone down because of the work they did on my home. I would recommend them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What has the world done to the people in this place to make them hate life as they do?  And why does that translate to the mediocre food?  \n\nYou can do better for pizza.  Hell, practically across the street from this place is Salvatore's.  You'll spend a bit more, but it'll be worth it.\n\nThis place slaps grease and cheese on cardboard, wraps it cardboard, and hands it to you with a look on their face that plainly says, \""I should have listened to my teachers in high school.\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A friend of mine told me about this place and that she had been wanting to go forever so the next double date night we had, we opted to make reservations for the four of us. I easily made reservations on their website through Urban Spoon for 8pm on Saturday night.\n\nWe arrived a bit earlier than the other couple but were able to be sat at our table while we waited. Given the pictures I had seen online, our table seemed to be located in the less romantic room of the place. We were in a back room with a table for four and two other tables for two. While the house did have some character with the wood floors, as our other friends arrived they mentioned 'I think we're in a kids bedroom'. There weren't any candles and the lights were up all the way so definitely not a romantic vibe. We also had several visitors to the closet behind our table throughout our meal checking wires or something.\n\nOur server was good and her timing was great. We inquired about the BYOB and it was $10 for the cork fee. I've never been to a restaurant where they do this so it was definitely new. I'm still undecided how I feel about having to pay them $10 PER BOTTLE to drink my own wine. To each their own I guess. \n\nAll of the food was really good. We ordered the Three Onion Tarte and the other couple had the Brie Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both were really good and different. We shared the Taleggio salad and while our waitress said all of the salads were incredible, I can't say I was overly impressed. They did split it for us which is always welcomed but it didn't have anything memorable about it and I didn't care for the prickly pear dressing paired up with the fruit. I was the only one at the table who ventured out for the filet and the other three ordered the Pork Tenderloin. My filet was cooked perfectly and the tangy sauce was really good and complimented the steak really well! Unfortunately the vegetable medley over the steak had mushrooms in it, something I don't like and would have requested be left out of the dish but wasn't specified on the menu. I spent a lot of time picking through my plate as I ate. The mash potatoes were good I think. Someone asked me the next day what came with my steak and I honestly didn't remember if it came with potatoes or not and had to look up the menu to refresh my memory. Maybe it was the wine. \n\nFor dessert we shared the peanut butter and chocolate pie dish, it was good, rich and only needed a few bites. The dinner was perfectly timed and we were having such a good conversation, we ended up closing down the restaurant and they graciously never rushed us out of there. The owner did stop by our table and was really friendly and I appreciated the attention. Overall, it was a pretty good visit and we might try it again once they move into their new location. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Poor performance and total confusion at the shop. I ordered a cake for my son's baptism. I left detailed instructions, only to receive frantic phone calls a mere hour and a half before the time the cake was supposed to be picked up relaying that the decorator had \""no clue\"" what I wanted.\n\nThe decorations were very plain, underwhelming. The cake tasted bland and boring, price was absolutely not worth it. Would not recommend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This review if for the Holiday Inn-Greentree. I was traveling in Pittsburgh for work and picked this Holiday Inn due to it's proximity to downtown. I was not disappointed. This has been one of the better hotels I have stayed in.\n\nThe facility is very clean and the staff is very helpful. You can tell they recently renovated. Their workout facility was great, which is a nice change of pace from the majority of the hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are very spacious and have a refrigerator and microwave. This is great if you don't feel like going out to eat. There is a Giant Eagle right down the street too.\n\nThe hotel offers free wifi which has great speed and makes working from your room easy. There is a shuttle service that runs from the hotel to down town ever hour. All you have to do is ask the front desk and they will help you coordinate. They offer a free breakfast in the morning which is always great as well.\n\nThe next time I am in the Pittsburgh area I will be returning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We purchased a groupon for dinner.  We got married there several years ago and felt it was a great way to revisit.  We were so disappointed!  The view was spectacular as well as the mansion but our food was mediocre for such a nice place.  We were sat by the wine closet and were interrupted numerous times.  Clearly there was available tables we could have otherwise dined at.  When our coffee came at the end of dinner it was cold and had been sitting for quite awhile.  \n\nWe WON'T be back for the food. :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Simply lovely. A lot has changed since the other reviewers ate here.\n\n1) No more tasting menu - I was dissapointed as this is why I went (and its still mentioned on the web site)\n\n2) They don't seem to be emphasizing local sourcing - on the menu there was only the mention of some local eggs for the creme brulee dessert\n\n3) Focus on lower priced dishes - I was apprehensive at the prices, they are amazingly low\n\nIn any case - dinner was delightful. Our overly friendly waiter which the rest of the table loved, did an overall great job. Everyone at the table was delighted at all the food we ordered - and we did the full on meal. From appetizers to soup to entree including sides and desserts. The waiter also recommended are a resonably priced ($50/bottle) that was excellent.\n\nAnd yes, the room itself is very charming and when we sat down I asked the host about the place and he told us all about the history of the space.\n\nAt about 8pm on a rainy Thursday night it was just us and two other tables. I hope they get more business since this is a great independent restaurant that deserves to thrive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I rarely visit a restaurant where the service stands out to the point that it deserves an update to the five star review I already gave it. While visiting Spinatos recently, I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our seats and grabbed us water right away. Then, the second the the hostess left, the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly, but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work! Great pizza and great staff! A + Spinatos! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There is nothing not to like! Frugal MacDoogal's is just on the other side of the state line. Prices are cheaper (cash prices are even better than credit) and the selection is great! Take the drive and fill up on booze (and gas while you are down here!). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food and prices are decent but the service could use some work. I felt like this one waitress was very rude. Also, I ordered take out recently, picked it up myself, and payed with a credit card. I found out a couple of days later that they took it upon themselves to add gratuity. It was kind of shady business practice so I won't go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I feel compelled to say that I agree with Vinh about Mindy W. There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out they only go out like four times a year!\n\nI like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. On rare occasion, such as when I order prime rib at S&W, I get it rare. This is the ONLY way to eat quality meat. USDA Prime meat (and Choice) is not going to kill you like the crap you get in supermarkets. Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.\n\nI've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet \""cooked to order\"", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail at Capital. The lobster bisque needed more lobster, but the bisque was quite good and not too strong. My filet entrees were awesome. It's amazing that they can make Choice cuts taste like Prime. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My brother is a total beer snob and loves trying out local breweries, so when he came in town this weekend he picked SunUp for us to check out.  My father and brother were already there when I arrived and my dad said that the waitress told him everything on the menu is good (which in my mind is the same as saying nothing on the menu is good).  My brother and I picked the fish and chips with garlic/parm fries, and my dad got the shepherd's pie.\n\nMy brother got the flight of seven (I think? that's usually the number served for a flight at these types of places) beers and enjoyed them.  The food was a different story though.  The fish was one giant piece, which wasn't bad in itself, except that the breading was super thick and not crispy at all, really.  It was also a bit dry.  The garlic/parm fries were WEIRD - just something about the taste was wrong.  The coleslaw literally made me laugh out loud when I tried it - it tasted like nothing.  No salt, no vinegar, nothing.  My dad, who will virtually eat anything, salted it and said it still wasn't good.  His shepherd's pie looked okay, and he ate it and said it was alright.\n\nI would personally never come back here for food.  Maybe just some beers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Don't be fooled by the location in a strip mall.  Go there.  It's some of the best food I've had in Phoenix.  We showed up with 6 people and no reservation.  No problem!  It's clearly a place with a solid base of regulars, as evidenced by the gregarious interaction between the staff and patrons.  Two of the people in our party had not been to the new location since they moved from Bell Rd., and so were hoping it was still as good as it used to be, and it did not disappoint!   My father ordered veal (can't remember honestly if it was parm or marsala), and said it was some of the best he had ever tasted.  Three of us ordered the Pollo Piemontese and LOVED it.  Reasonably priced, beautifully presented, and the staff is top-notch.  We were so full from dinner that we declined dessert, and as a treat the owner sent over an after-dinner aperitif on the house.  You don't get treated like that every day, now do you?  I'll be back next time i'm in Phoenix, you can count on that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  New ownership maybe but it's not the same here. Cashier wasn't friendly. The high chairs were so messy with caked in food. It took me many wipes to get it suitable for my son to sit in and eat in. Wires hanging down from window lights.  Napkin dispensers empty during dinner time. Come on! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I gave one star because you can't give none!! The manager, Mary Figerarro was mean to me, she yelled at me and told me I was wrong because I wanted a sandwich that was cooked!! And continued to show her attitude problem about me having a different opinion about how done the roast should be cooked!!!!  I asked for a refund and she yelled at me again because I took my receipt!!!  She is a raging witch!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The worst place on earth. Lines are ridiculous no matter what time you arrive, customer service is deplorable and there are never enough parking spaces. This place rivals the dmv and social security office, Time Warner is a monopoly in Charlotte so it doesn't have to worry with how it treats it's customers. We normally don't have cable, but we're adding it back for football season. I am spending my day off waiting in this absurd line for a cable box so that my husband can watch the Panthers. If only we could get ESPN on our Apple TV... I can't wait until we can just stream everything <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For the price, you can't beat this gym. It's one of the larger locations, so even at peak times you'll still be able to lift, hit the treadmill, or find an elliptical machine. The prices are super reasonable and the equipment is in good working order. They also offer tons of classes from Zumba to yoga. If you're looking to join a gym, I recommend this one. I've been with them for years. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nothing but good things can be said about the food here, I simply haven't had a bad meal yet and doubt I ever will. I positively love New Mexican style cuisine and how spicy it can get. Pretty amazing how hard it is to find here in the Valley! \nDrop in for a weekend brunch meal and treat yourself to a super spicy Bloody Mary or a tasty mimosa and start the morning off right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have dined at Soba more times than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh; it is my favorite! The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town. \n\nOnce I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time!\n\nThe drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here. \n\nThe atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new). Our last server was really slow about checking on us and drinks took a long time (though it wasn't busy). And as with most Big Burrito restaurants, I don't like that there are separate food runners from servers, because it makes it confusing and more time consuming to ask for things. I prefer the bar seating and service, usually. \n\nAll in all, I think Soba is Pittsburgh's best place to eat and drink. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really love this restaurant! The food is always very good. I have been there many times and tried many different things.  At night it can be semi romantic.They dim the lights and they have live music. The wings are very good, as well as the meals and pizza. The coffee is never hot for some reason.  That would be about the only thing i could find wrong. They used to be a small little dive restaurant and have now moved several years ago to the location they are now. Food has always been good though. Sometimes dives are the best! It is family owned and run so  i think that is why they take such pride in the place. A very good thing. They have their own parking lot but, not many spaces on a busy  night. Great place for a meal at any time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> As I sit a the gate 3, Terminal 2, UA1507 PHX-SFO in the plane with a 90 minute \""SFO Flow Control\"" and \""Mechanical problem of rivets missing on the engine cone?!\""  delay, I write this review. \n\nSky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to give Aunt Chilada's credit - we stayed for a quite a while at an outside table drinking our margaritas until we realized that at 10:30pm we were the very last people there and that the restaurant had pretty much closed down around us. They had already picked up the check and never pushed us out so we had a relaxing evening.\n\nUnfortunately I was unimpressed with the food. The chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic. A spinach enchilada was very bland and a chile releno was mostly breading with a small chile and cheese but not much flavor. The two people who were with me agreed that their food was mediocre as well. We went with the frozen margarita only because we wanted a pitcher and the margarita on the rocks pitcher was much more expensive. The margarita was also unimpressive - perhaps the more expensive one would have been better but the regular on one the menu just tasted like frozen sour mix. \n\nWe had a good time, but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips, drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really good stuff!!! Service was incredible - pretzel rolls were to-die-for. I think between 3 of us, we had 3 baskets.... Sausages are delectable and spaetzle and red cabbage is awesome. We are to be new regulars!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you like the Olive Garden, you'll LOVE Lidia's!  \n\nWe were a party of two on a Sunday night -- the restaurant was moderately busy.  Our server was a bit of a space cadet.  We had to stop another waiter to ask for more water...I was never offered a refill on my diet coke (which sat empty for over 30 minutes).\n\nThe salmon was very good, but drenched in so much olive oil and garlic that an oil slick was left on the plate at the end of the meal.  The pasta tasting was....kind of weird.  One of the selections tasted like feet, the other tasted like something I could make at home with a bottle of Prego.  The best was a mushroom ravioli in olive oil -- but there was so much oil (see a theme?) I had to scrape it off before eating.\n\nLong story short, we passed on dessert.   The food was adequate, the service was sub-par, and it was just kind of a \""meh\"" experience.\n\nI won't go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One star for their great service. Food was the worst BBQ ever, horrible, ribs were rare?  Yes pink stuck to the bone not done, threw them away.   Expensive and horrible food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great spot in University City, take your dog and enjoy an adult beverage next to the lake. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Creepiest place ever. Didnt even get out of my car after a group of shady people started staring at my in the parking lot. Don't go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am typically a pretty understanding customer and realize that with anything mistakes on orders can happen.  Last night I placed a take out order and ordered the super nachos and only wanted beans cheese and sour cream.  I have gotten this order once a week for the last month and never and I do mean never have they ever put green chillis in the cheese.  \n\nAfter getting home last night when I found that the order had the chillis I asked them to correct it.  The cashier was accomadating but the owner was very rude to my wife and I and lied to ou faces saying that is what they always do.  I informed him of how often we come to his business and he still did not show any concern for us. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING their and they lost a customer for life. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The grocery store is cool, pastries looked delicious and the overall vibe of the place was cool. But our burritos were not great. Moved to Phoenix 6 years ago and have yet to find anything close to a Bay Area burrito. What is so hard about having the whole thing heated through?? Still searching. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of my favorite places of all time. Great atmosphere and even better food. Their appetizers are yum. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food is still good, but coming off the regular rotation list after tonight.  Was on the bubble with difficult parking and table waits, but tonight was ridiculous.  3 tables that came in after us had their dinners before us, with no explanation.  Table for 2 by the window, came in after us, finished eating and left before our appetizer came.  A shame.  What a way to lose business.  There are other places to go. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this place. The staff are all really, really sweet. Remember you after 1 visit and actually have a conversation with you. It's a family joint and you'll probably meet them all. Good color selection, acrylics, and gel too. Whenever I am in town, I usually stop in (thanks mom!). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Would prefer to have my face gnawed off by rats than go here again. Quite possibly the worst experience of my life. Pulled in at 1058 told them I wanted everything, hand wash, wax, the works but I was on my way out of town so in a bit of a rush manager asked me if 30 minutes was ok I said yeah. 30 minutes later I went to check and found they hadn't started yet!! I got in my truck and left stopping out front for a refund. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63, I got soup, salad, vegetables tempura, 6 avocado rolls, steamed rice, and pickles.  It was a ton of food and more than filling enough - I didn't even eat the salad and I was stuffed.  I will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - I added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  Even though it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  Oops.), it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's not the people, but how the bank itself runs that pisses me off. The fees, the red tape, the general BS I seem to have problems with these buttheads. I have three (3) business accounts here and they tell me time \n-and-again that I need to open a personal account to cash my paycheck with them. I own my business, the check is from them BofA, it's made out to me. F***ers give me my money, it's mine NOT yours. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Maybe I am the most \""uncool\"" person on Yelp, but I HATED this place.  A friend and I decided to meet here thinking it sounded like a chill place to have a drink, relax, go down memory lane, etc.\n\nWe drove separately and I arrived before him.  I paid a $10 cover to get inside, only to discover that \""inside\"" was so dark I could not see, so packed I could not move, and playing the most INSANELY loud I-don't-even-know-what-to-call-it music I have ever heard.\n\nTrying not to be a diva, I went to the bar and ordered a Jack on the rocks.  It took me screaming at the bartender to accomplish this feat, likely through no fault of his own.\n\nAnyway, my buddy showed up and miraculously recognized my silhouette in the dark.  (I am a perfectly normal size 10/12 so I didn't stand out at all.)  \n\nHe ordered a drink and we stood in awkward, pitch-black, booming silence until we decided to just slam our drinks and leave.\n\nThat was the most interesting $15+ dollar Jack (including cover) I have ever had.\n\nI don't see the appeal.  Maybe on a weekday? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a TGI Fridays. It was a Saturday evening visit, and it was one of those days...\nFirst off, I've been to this Friday's before, and it was decent. This time, it went bad. Starting off, the atmosphere was awfully loud with a few drunks at the bar, @ 530?!? The food however started ok, and progressively got bad. We ordered two appetizers and our main courses. Apps were ok, not great, but our fried green beans were luke warm at best and our dip was ice cold. We got Ribs and Chicken, and the Ribs were tough and very meatless for the cost of the dish. The chicken was soggy, and tasteless. Our waiter, he was very attentive, but too attentive, coming back every 2-3 minutes asking if everything was ok. It seemed like he knew there was a bigger problem than we thought.. It was a disaster on date night, and very disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been here twice. The food is pretty good; service is awful. The first time I was there it was very crowded. I was just getting a pre-made salad and a drink and apparently was in the \""wrong\"" line. After waiting my turn and finally getting to the cashier, she rudely told me I was in the wrong line and wouldn't ring me up. SORRY. Did not know that, being my first time. \n\nI had a similar experience with snotty cashiers the 2nd time I went. It's always over-crowded but I guess the yuppie a-holes love this place. I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When I used to work in downtown Phoenix I'd come here for lunch if I hadn't brought mine. I'd always get the pasta special which comes with the pasta, soup, bread stick, and a drink. You can get a free refill.\n\nA few times I got a breakfast burrito there and they're made to order. They were decent.\n\nIts unfortunate that this is the only affordable place to eat anything in downtown Phoenix. Sometimes Sheriff Joe and his security team eat here if you'd like to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nOn rare occasions the owners are rude. But that's rare so maybe they were having a bad day. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best Thai food in town, for sure.  Screw all those other places, they're inferior and probably cost way more.\n\nThe green curry is my favorite thing, but the yellow curry is pretty good.  There are vegetarian options (although I usually go for the meat), and one time they had a salmon tom kha gai soup special, which I wasn't sure was a good idea, but it was actually a terrific idea.\n\nOne of the few places I can take any or all of my family or in-laws and be sure that everyone will enjoy themself.\n\nThe name kind of lends itself to semi-comedic confusion, though:\n\""Where do you want to go for dinner?\""\n\""How about Thai Cuisine?\""\n\""Thai sounds great.  Where do you want to go?\""\n\""Um... Thai Cuisine?\""\n(Wash, rinse, repeat...) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  No free WiFi, you have to go outside to get to elevators and corridors to rooms are outside as well, which is a ridiculously bad idea in Phoenix's 100 degree heat. Trash in corridors as well. Hotel restaurant is poor as well <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> funky little cafeteria atop a very popular pittsburgh breakfast spot. it's BYOB - always nice - and the food is abundant and tasty. very casual, small menu, good, attentive service. plus they have a little shop with peruvian gifts, including an incas vs. spanish chess game, fluffy mini-llamas, and bright woven goods. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  ok so.. I'm obviously no thai connoisseur.. but I was really looking forward to a good peanut sauce with my Pad Thai.. Fail. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've driven by here a few times, but this weekend decided to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.\n\nComedor Guadalajara's exterior is pretty unassuming.  Looks like a brownish/pinkish box.  Once you walk in, you can see that while they have some nice Mexican items, let's just say you won't be paying for the decor.  When I went by Sunday afternoon their after church crowd was huge.  I was just getting mine to go luckily.  I didn't hear anyone quoted more than a 10-15 min wait - and some of those were crowds of 8-10.  Walking through the restaurant - it's huge!  There is so much seating I can understand why it was the go to spot.  \n\nAlso, I loved the mix of folks.  There was this guy in a cowboy hat, plaid shirt w/ jeans tucked into his cowboy boots standing right next to a guy in a full suit w/ a snazzy tie and shiny shoes.  It was really a great snapshot of Downtown/Southern Phoenix.  So yea, there were like 2 white groups.  But the rest of this place was a somewhere in the brown scale.  Black, Hispanic and mixed folks all hanging out waiting for the food.  To me, this is a good sign.  \n\nThe Chicken Chimi was absolutely amazing.  Some of the most flavorful chicken pieces with lots of red & green pepper and onions.  I also tried their Pechuga Asado which was really good.  3 lunch meals, plus a 60 cent \""to go charge\"" (weird, huh?) came out to $35.19.  We will definitely be going back again next time to try all their amazing seafood platters.  While they looked outstanding, I didn't think they were quite \""to go\"" kind of food.  Something to look forward to next time... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Monty's is one of my fave brunch-or-lunch places, especially on lazy weekends when I want breakfast food at 2pm but do not want big-chain food.  They have a wide array of something for everyone from vegan offerings to biscuits and gravy to slices of cake taller than your head, and it's all tasty.  \n\nIt does get really crowded at peak times, and the service can be hit-or-miss to an extreme:  sometimes I've gotten a server who hangs around making hilarious jokes and sometimes I've been in parties that were actually forgotten about after we were seated and then have the orders wrong when we finally did get our food (although the bad service is definitely more rare than the good).  \n\nAll-in-all the tasty food and the kitschy atmosphere make it worth the wait. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Totally starving this morning.  Had to go to the store but it was closed.  Went to 5 and Diner at Tatum and Cactus area.  \n\nWe were taken to our table and it took 11 minutes to have any one come to greet us.  Slow service.  Then a waitress stopped by - took our order.  The food came out quick.  Had the 2 eggs with bacon and biscuits and gravy.\n\nI hate it when your eggs come out and they are crunchy....CAN'T ANYONE SEE THAT THEY WERE COOKED TOO FAST AND THEY ARE CRUNCHY..  QUALITY PEOPLE....  QUALITY!!!!!  yuk!!!  Picked around the crunchy parts. Bacon was good.  Biscuits were ok...  lightly dusted with gravy.  semi warm.\n\nNot a fan of this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  While I LOVE Mad Mex, this one is to be avoided.  For whatever reason, they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions, I've just not felt well after eating there.  Because it's a BB, I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that.  But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues, I've had to write this location off.  Go to Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get a new KM for this location!) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just moved to AZ from NJ and dinner here was a \""Taste of Home\"".  My wife enjoyed the Seafood Marinara, and I thought the Penned w Meat sauce was excellent.  I'll definitely make the trip from N Glendale and eat here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I became such a regular here  that once, upon ordering at the drive-thru window and discovering I had forgotten my wallet, the woman who works the window told me to just pay her the next time I came there (we visited every Saturday). Yes, the people who run the place are really that nice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Underwhelming to say the least. Yeah we went on a Thursday but what a strange place. Not my idea of a cool wine bar at all. Atmosphere was blah. Music was weird and barely existent. The wine selection was half assed. The food selection was also half assed. Although the guy who seated us was great, he was not dressed for the part at all. He looked like he rolled off a 1970's surf flick. I don't know it was like Keanu meets eddy vedder. Weird. It had not ambiance no style, nothing going for it. It was not cool to even be in there. Will I be back.....uh I don't think so. Would I recommend it, ahhh hell no. Like I said I only had one good thing to say and the Keanu Eddy Vedder host was good and attentive. Otherwise the place was not even worth wasting space in my brain to remember.\n\nPeople talking about most extensive wine and cheese list in AZ, well kid, you have not been to very many wine bars. This place does not even come close to most extensive of anything in AZ!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very frustrating experience.  Our order was very simple but the cashier couldn't get it right.  While waiting for our food I watched the beleaguered manager apologizing to every table.  Every customer had a problem with their food or order.  We waited twenty minutes for our food and decided to leave.   I have never experienced more incompetence.  Never again..... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> very little to complain about with TGI Fridays.  i am always able to get an item that is no longer on the menu (blackened Cajun chicken sandwich) and the menu is constantly changing.  Always worth a visit a few times a month. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Napkin mittens.     How is it possible to destroy a sandwich and it's contents in the matter of 30 seconds?   Let's see, they put it together with yummy ingredients then they must use a large stick to shove it in the wrapper.  Nice party trick but not good at a restaurant.  What a mess when you open it, and I even had to use a spork to finish it.\n\nAnyways, the food tastes good and the free cookie is a nice touch.   Oh yeah, the other beef I have with this place is the sign \""Drink refills for large size only!\"" WTF!!!\n\nI'll be inventing those napkin mittens before I come back to this place again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A typical chain restaurant. In the city of Phoenix, there are way better Mexican places that are not chains. I would go elsewhere.\n\nDO NOT GET THE MICROBREW BEER!!! I had the Pilsner and the Amber, and they both tasted the same. I have consumed over 190 different bottles of microbrewed beer, and I was stunned to see that a pilsner tasted the same as the amber. Also, the pilsner was cloudy, which is the opposite of what a pilsner should be. Pilsners are clean, clear and crisp with a thin body. The pilsner I had could be described as a confused Hefeweizen. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When Smokey Bones first arrived here in the University area, we went several times and enjoyed ourselves greatly.  The brisket was smashing, the pulled pork was very good, ribs were spot on (this was before I became a Yelper).  So we decide to go last evening and MAN were we disappointed.  Now, I hate that my second review rivals my first inasmuchas I am not writing a good review, but I feel that this must be done before any Yelper out there goes and blows good money on dinner here.  \n\nThe most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket.  I cook and understand that to keep brisket moist, there needs to be a fat content to the meat.  What I recieved last night was underprepped and under cooked brisket (It was done to temperature, but for brisket to be done correctly, it must be cooked until the fat renders more making the meat tender).  There was so much fat, and it was fairly tough.  \n\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Portobello ($13.95) and got a grilled chicken breast (Dry) next to a stuffed protobello mushroom (burned).  I still haven't figured out what we paid that preposterous price for.   \n\nThe kids enjoyed their meals: a dry chicken breast for my son and a slightly overcooked burger for my daughter, but she mainly ate the fries (which were good!)\n\nThe shining star of the meal was the St. Louis ribs on my combo plate.  Smokey and just tender enough to eat easily without literally dropping off the bone.  Unfortunatly they no longer keep BBQ sauce at the table (you have to ask for it?!?!) and I used to enjoy mixing up the varieties to make new flavors.  \n\nThe food was disappointing, but what further bothers me is that had I been the waiter, I would never have served the food to my wife.  It was visibly dry and not terribly appealing.  I worry for the service industry when servers are expected to serve unappealing food rather than taking it back to the kitchen and getting a fresh plate (Bottom line restauranting).  \n\nAnyhow, I am not a problem customer, I just expect a little more for my money than I got.  We will not return, so I will have a new restaurant to review as we search for a good meal!\n\nEAT WELL!\n\nVic <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \n\nOne of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\"" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\n\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \n\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food, and affordable as well.  My wife and I get it to go.  It travels very well.  I've had better Naan, but overall.  It's great Indian when you have the craving.  Tip:  Don't get the Meat Naan. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Would normally give Pauls 4 stars,but have reduced it due to a recent customer service issue.I am a 'sorta regular' here. They have very good fish frys and equally tasty breakfasts [bacon is exceptional] ,along with generally friendly service...That  changed Sunday..Was here with companions .. Decided to play the \""'cherry master video machine\"" during our visit..Got to a $50 credit when we HAD to leave...Asked Julie to just clear the machine as she was very busy,and I would return later for the money...Please keep in mind clearing machine involves pressing a button and one second of time. Reply was \""can't now\"". Waited ten minutes as she walked by me 3 times..Finally told here again we needed to leave...She basically went into a public rant yelling to the bartender to \""give this guy $50\""...We just can not justify returning after this experience..Darn, cause it's generally a decent place... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Per dollar, your not going to find any better food close by.  I'm not saying literally \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""  But, on that side of town I don't know of any other place you can get full and have a beer for under $10.\n\nIt is a Deli/Grille with beer.  Pretty straight forward.  You grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order, then you order at the counter.  You walk around the side to pay and they give you a number.  Put that number on your table, and your food will be delivered shortly.  No wait service, just fast service.  I prefer eating out on the patio if there is space available.\n\nThere is quite a variety of choices.  From burgers to french dips.  Bratwurst to meatball subs.  Salads, stuffed potatoes, and even some vegetarian options.  I've tried it all and never had a bad meal.\n\nI know this review sounds more like an ad for the place, but I really have nothing bad to say.  Its a chill little spot that puts out great food at a reasonable price.  Kind of unheard of on park rd. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband has been researching places to find an artist with whom he could have a long standing and lucrative relationship.  After checking out places on Yelp, we decided to head down to NODA to check out Fu's Custom Tattoos.  We walked in around 1:20pm and spoke with the receptionist who was nice ( reason I am giving one star out of two).  There was only one tattoo artist there since they just opened.  He was in the front booth.  I am sure to all that know this place, I do not have to mention a name.  He seemed VERY disinterested, but spoke to my husband anyway and we figured it was just his personality.  My husband showed him some ideas he liked for a half-sleeve, but also said that the artist could have creative freedom to come up with something original.  The artist took a $50 deposit and made an appt with my husband for 2 weeks later, on a Sunday, at 1pm.  My husband was very excited.\n\nSo, two weeks roll around and we head out to NODA.  I could tell my husband was really looking forward to his appointment and tattoo.  There was a huge bike race going on in NODA and it was fun to watch (we got there a little early).  When it was time, we went to Fu's.  The receptionist greeted us, but seemed surprised that my husband had an appointment and began texting pretty quickly on her phone.  She told us that the artist was running late and to have a seat.  1:10, no artist. 1:15, no artist. 1:20, no artist. 1:25, no artist. 1:30, the receptionists tells us that he has been in a \""bump-up\"" and is waiting for the police.  She asks my husband to reschedule.  My husband works many odd hours and did not know his schedule offhand. The receptionist said that she would have the artist call my husband the next day to reschedule.  We head home....\n\nMonday, no phone call all day.  Tuesday my husband calls and said that he wants his deposit back.  No tattoo from Fu's after all that.\n\nHere is what I have to say about the situation: \n1. If you were truly in an accident, I am sorry and I hope all is OK (benefit of the doubt gives Fu's one more star).\n\n2. Also, if you were unavailable to call my husband the next day, you should have  had the receptionist call.\n\n3. If you were not in a \""bump up\"", and just didn't want to do the work and make money, it would be better customer service to direct us to an artist that would be happy to do it than to put us through all this.(also an artist that wants a customer to turn into a recurring client!)  Gas is expensive!\n\nI never write reviews on Yelp.  This is my first one.  I would have rather it been more positive, but being in the customer service business myself, I am sensitive to bad service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Eek!  Me thinks not is the truth!  HORRIBLE with a CAPITAL HORRIBLE!  About 3-4 weeks ago I took in a 20x20 poster to be framed.  The guy told me it would be ready 9/19.  Notice that It's 3 days later than 9/19 and I have not yet received a call from them telling me my frame STILL isn't ready, but I have also called multiple times since Monday and I sit on hold for 10-20 minutes only to find out they still haven't done my frame.  If you quote a date, it needs to be available to be picked up that day or before in my opinion.  After speaking to the manager just now, he says they have \""125 customers that they deal with weekly in the framing dept.\""  uh-huh.  That's NOT that many customers for a big name store and if they can't get their s*** together by the day they say they will, then they better back it up with a phone call or in the future recommend a later day that the item should be finished and ready for pickup.  Total crap. Two thumbs DOWN, wayyyy DOWN. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wonderful! Hailing from the Midwest, I've always loved desert flora and fauna because it's so radically different from what I grew up with. A few hours at the Desert Botanical Garden really indulged my fascination. Grab a sunhat, a camera and set aside a few hours to wander the trails here. It's truly a delightful experience. Besides all the amazing plantlife, I saw myriad birds, a lizard, a jackrabbit and some other kind of tree rodent thing, though I sadly did not catch a glimpse of desert tortoise. I guess I'll just have to go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This store is OK. It has been remodeled since the last reviewers and is clean and modern looking now. I tried the chipolte grilled chicken sandwich they have been advertising on the radio and it was bland. It was not spicy and I had pepper jack cheese on it. The chipolte sauce did not have any flavor at all. I could taste the bread over everything else. I do not recommend this sandwich unless you are looking for a bland, flavorless sandwich. \n\nI would like to add that the girls working the counter did a great job getting everyone through the line quickly. Sometimes when you go to Subways the people working the counter think your there just to stand and look at the ingredients under the glass. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The selection of bikes and accessories here is pretty good, but the service was terrible. These were the most unfriendly, annoyed, least helpful people I've ever experienced at a bike shop. They were annoyed that we got there 20 minutes before closing and practically shooed us out the door promptly at 5 'til. We rode our bikes there and bought a basket for my cruiser (and a couple other things) and asked them if they had a tool we could use to put it on real quick. They said \""maybe if you got here 25 minutes earlier we could help you.\"" I mean, I get it, you're closing, but you don't have to be so rude. It would probably have taken you five minutes to put it on since you probably do that exact thing about 5 times a day. Plus, we have been to a lot of bike shops and they are usually the most friendly people, willing to stay an extra few minutes to earn your business. We've spent thousands of dollars at other bike shops and we won't be going to this one again, even though it's just blocks from our house. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Phoenix is very fortunate to have such an awesome zoo. It is an awesome zoo that left a strong impression on me when I visited in 2004. Fast forward eight years, and we drove over 200 miles from Las Vegas to Phoenix to see it. The Phoenix Zoo is so awesome that if I had the power, I would trade the best Las Vegas casino for the Phoenix Zoo. Since I don't have that power, I will write a review of why the Phoenix Zoo is so awesome.Instead of repeating facts such as admission is $20, I broke the review into sections. Each section discusses the awesome characteristics of the sections of the zoo.\n\nTropics Trail\n\n  As Phoenix builds a bigger and better Phoenix Zoo, the temporary entrance is near Tropics Trail at the far right . This is where visitors get their first impressions of the Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are the elephant, jaguar, tortoise, iguana, Andean Bear, rhinoceros, anteater, flamingo, and manned wolf. \n\nChildren's Trail\n\n  The southeast section of the Phoenix Zoo is more than a children's zoo. Because it sits on the south side of water it is a hot spot for waterfowl viewing. On the path to the petting zoo is emu, bald eagles, an island showcasing siamang, warty pigs, and ocelot. The highlight of the Children's Trail is the Harmony Farm. Grownup children will also enjoy the Big Red Barn and windmill house.\n\nThe Main Lake\n\n  The Main Lake is the central right area of Phoenix Zoo where the walkways circle Main Lake. Besides the Main Lake; the highlight exhibits include Land of the Dragons, two islands showcasing lemur, otter, flamingos, and gibbon. For an additional expense there is a camel ride. By this time you might be hungry or thirsty. The Cavern Cafe serves decent food and soft drinks.\n\nAfrica Trail\n\n  The Africa Trail sits at the back center of Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are cheetahs, African wild dog, baboons, mandrils, warthogs, lions, and tigers.\n\nArizona Trail\n\n  The Arizona Trail is my favorite area of the Phoenix Zoo. It is here that a visit to the zoo changes into a hike into wild Arizona. The bighorn sheep exhibit is off the charts well done. The bighorn sheep exhibit incorporates a real mountain. This is the exhibit that leaves an imprint that Phoenix Zoo is awesome. It could be the best bighorn sheep exhibit in the country. Throughout Arizona Trail, natural Arizona treats the zoogoer to four star scenery and first rate pictures. It is the part of the zoo where bunny rabbits outpopulate wild animals. The Wild Arizona Trail, in my opinion is worth $10 of the $20 admission.\n\n  The Arizona Trail is discontinuous. To the left of the Zoo Plaza there is a more developed Arizona Trail. Here the highlight exhibits are bobcats, Mexican Wolf, Mountain lion, and pronghorn. This is also where the First Aid Station is located.\n\nThe Savanna\n\n  The Savanna is the center of the Phoenix Zoo. In the future it will be the main entrance. It serves as the plaza and savanna section of the Phoenix Zoo. Here you have Savanna Grill (my brother said there burgers are good) and Karibu Cafe. This is where the gift shop is. The main Safari Train Station is here. The highlight exhibit is a savanna showcasing giraffes, eland, and zebras. There is also a stingray bay.\n\nThe Exit\n\n  I left the Phoenix Zoo impressed. I was disheartened that it closes at 4 p.m. and that Las Vegas does not have a Phoenix Zoo. Headed to my car, it was time to explore more of Phoenix. Phoenix Zoo is near downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and Arizona Mills. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a depressing coffee shop. I went in on a wednesday afternoon to find the place dim, muggy, eerily silent (as in no music or talk, just shuffling noises), and filled with a sense of sadness.  I tried to sit down and enjoy some coffee, which was drinkable, but I couldn't get over the odd atmosphere, that is until the music started, so quiet I couldn't even tell you what it was, just that it was on. I'm giving it two stars for the awesome alternative energy posters hanging on the far wall. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stopped here to share three appetizers after sharing three appetizers at BlackFinn.  What a mistake!  The lobster crab cakes were one bite, if that and its questionable if there was actually lobster and crab in there.  We also had two Scallops wrapped in prosciutto, saut\u00e9ed crisp and served over a fava bean puree, topped with\nlemon marmalade which were just mediocre, and 3 Risotto balls which were stuffed with pancetta, sweet onions and mozzarella fried crispy and served\nwith a rich tomato sauce.   What a disappointment, the risotto balls were very bland and gummy.  The only good thing was the Lemon Drop Martini.  We should have eaten more at BlackFinn, we will know for our next trip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very loud, bad service, and the food doesn't met the expectations. We came w a party of 10 people, we didn't even get menus for a while, it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server. Dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time. Super disappointed <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First time going had a HORRIBLE wait time during lunch... The manager comped my food, but for a quesadilla a 30 minute wait is crazy since it's an appetizer.  I will not be going back any time soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had never been to CG and decided to indulge myself a little while out of town on business. After a brief conversation with a foodie friend, I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience. \n\nFood: 1 Star \n\nFor fancy steakhouses, I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce. \n\nI've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it. I did order some bleu cheese crumbles to go with it but it didn't mix well either. I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit! \n\nBut to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal. I am assuming my problem was remote and hopefully only a local problem but it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next time I goto a nice steakhouse. \n\nService: 4 Star \n\nService was great, but obviously, who cares if you get crap at your plate? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Big bunch of family over so we created our own buffet!  Shrimp biryani, veggie biryani, tandoori shrimp and tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, samosas, raita, and lots of naan (plain, cheese and garlic).  Everyone loved the chicken...which I don't eat, but others said it was good.  I loved both biryanis and the paneer with raita over it.  I also loved the naan dipped in masala sauce! SO glad it's close to home! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). \n\nI'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very overrated for the price.  Decor is good but tables are packed closed together.  I found the food to be mediocre - my friend & I had the chef's choice menu and found it quite lacking. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mediocre overpriced threading. Maybe I'm spoiled by my shabby little nails/threading place in New York, but Modern-Phillips Place charged me $70+ for what would be $30-40 in NY (compare business rents). \nSodi threaded my face in no particular order so I ended up with strays. It scared me to death the way she hopped between my sideburns and my brows--you can lose half a brow that way. \nNo consultation on the shaping. MEDIOCRE brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve. She did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so I guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow). The edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way. Holes should appear to be filled in magically. My brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face. She wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape, but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and NO STRAYS.\nNo pre-sanitation or post-care of the skin.\nA mark where she caught my skin in her thread.\nPlus, cold rude staff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The worst part of Le Peep is they aren't open for dinner, which only gives those of us who work during the week two days to enjoy all the delicious fare served up by Le Peep!\n\nOtherwise, I can't complain. Have always had a good experience and their food is delicious! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't typically review fast food chains but this location just asked for it. I wish I could give one star for this sorry excuse for a fried chicken chain. Not only do they have the WORST customer service ever (well, okay maybe not ever - I think Long Wong's MIGHT still have a slight edge) but they always forget the jalape\u00f1os. I mean, ALWAYS. Why is that?!?! And be warned - in this digital age, this company is a dying breed. They absolutely WILL NOT accept digital coupons, it MUST be in paper with NO exceptions. Even when the digital coupons have a coupon code printed in bright red on the top left hand corner and no barcode. Apparently their staff isn't bright enough to tip-tap-type these codes into the magical box of buttons and numbers to make the coupon effective. LAME. After my now second horrible experience at this Church's location, I'm Popeye's 4 LIFE! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Overrated, yes.\nFun, yes.\nSomething different in a very Midwestern town, yes.  For that reason alone I give it 4 stars.\n\nTake a look at the options while in Middleton, there isn't much.  This is a great place to get drunk and eat a cheeseburger.  That's about it.  However if that is what you want to do, come here.  They have an outdoor patio that is nice in the evening and on days that aren't too humid.  The place is loud and great for families.  The place is not good for an intimate setting, for that go to Lousianne's.\n\nBack to the thing about the drinks, the drink list is enourmous.  They have frozen drinks, on the rocks drinks, beer, liquor, you name they have it.    For those not from the midwest, it is a nice oasis.  I'll leave it at that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Met some friends here last night with high expectations due to good reviews. We had a party of 10 so we made sure we were there right when they opened at 5pm. They sat us immediately but when  we asked them up front (before we ordered) to split the checks they had a bit of an attitude. We made it a game to get them to lighten up. Which they did! A for effort on the waitresses part. We had her laughing and smiling.  I should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well. Not a good sign for a sushi place. This should have been our second red flag. Food came fairly quickly. It was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get. Towards the end they started to rush to get us out which we would have gladly done 30 minutes prior if they would bring our checks. By the time we got home I was extremely sick and that was how the rest of my night went! I am not new to sushi. In fact its my fav! I would NEVER go back to this place. The only reason its getting 1 star is because the waitress was a hoot! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I just moved to Pittsburgh from New Mexico and was excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \""Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\""). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \""What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\"" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles. I won't be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm a steak fan - with a preference for filet mignon. The Lone Star is a good, reasonably priced (about $20 a plate) fix when I really need a filet \""fix\"". Service is fairly fast, attentive, and friendly, the beer is really cold, and a cocktail has a bit of a kick. Salad was very crisp and fresh, steak was cook exactly as I markedly requested to my server (a true medium, not cooked medium rare or medium well - so my server was obviously paying attention to me!). As others have remarked, the baked potato was kinda smallish and a little overcooked, but I had the \""works\"" with it, so it was edible. Not the best steak dinner, but for the money, pretty good. Recommend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After busting out every tool I could find from the toolbox and trying for 30 minutes to remove a watch link, I gave up.\n\nLuckily, the watch guy was able to remove it in under a minute for $5. He also replaces batteries for the same.\n\nHe's cash only and not open on weekends. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would have given it 2.5 stars but you have to go with 2 or 3. \n\nPro's: location, location, location. Large outdoor deck and bar. Live music. Great gathering place for the locals or those who want to enjoy a view of the lake. Excellent after work stop also. The tall thin woman really works hard and is on top of things. \n\nCon's: Outdated decor and seating, average food to sub par food. Can be difficult to get a drink sometimes as it does get busy. Drinks outside of the happy hour can be a bit pricey, $4 for a bottle of Corona for here is a bit much I could see that at an uptown bar or something but not T-Bones. Idiots that sit there and throttle their outboards and choke out the people on the deck with their exhaust. \n\nThe place is quirky and odd, the can be a pro or a con for some. It is a part of Lake Wylie as much as the lake it seems. Go for the entertainment and think of this place more like a start to the night. They get bands and their is no cover. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food at Ritter's tastes like I made it at home, and this is not an endorsement.  I had the feta and tomato omelet, and it tasted skunked, like it had just been cooked in a dirty skillet.\n\nIt's a dirty diner with meh food, but it is open 24 hours.  If you're drunk, I bet the foood is great. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always fast but most importantly they are always honest with you. Their prices are very fair and they always want to show you the old part that was bad. The entire team there is great and very knowledgable. If you need anything done to your vehicle I would highly recommend taking it to Gabs, you won't be disappointed! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sky Harbor Airport is one of the most modern looking airports.  On top of it, it has to be one of the easiest airports to get around.  You can either enter the airport off the 143 highway or you can go straight on 44th St going south.  Sky Harbor gives plenty of chances and warnings of which terminals to go to.  There is basically 2 different departure terminals and two different arrival terminals.  The arrival portion can be a bit confusing, so you need to coordinate with your ride to the airport.  Once you get out of the gate, you have an option of going to the South Side or North Side.\n\nI have to say that this airport never seems to get too busy.  I have come here during major holidays, and the traffic is never bad.  I am not sure if it is because of the structure or if there are not as many passengers going in and out of Phoenix.  \n\nI never really get airport food, but this airport has all sorts of varieties.  They have a few good bars near the terminals to relax and chill before a flight. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy, and the bacon was minimal. It's just a little shack of a joint on a desolate street where you'd think you might meet Freddie Kruger after dark! But Darren was dying to go here just so he could review it, and it sucked, didn't it sweetie? ;) They didn't even deliver to us. I had to drive him there just to get it, and you can't eat in either. Cash only. Avoid.\n\nWe could have ordered from Slice, which I like and is in our hood, but noooo...\n\n:D <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Sure if you have a crazy craving for a weird pie Marie Callenders would be a great place to go, but other than I wouldn't recommend it. The food here isn't great, and I would even consider it overpriced for what you get taste wise. Also the real reason I wanted to review this place is the service here is just awful. I have only been there about twice in the past two years, but both times the service was just REALLY bad. I mean these servers were weird and did not know what they were doing.\n\nPlease Marie Callenders start screening your employees! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't frequent the Galleria very much but go to their movie theater every once in a while.  The theater is outdated and old - you would think for their target clientele they would give the movie theater an upgrade.  The stores that I enjoy here include, Anthropologie, Williams-Sonoma and Charming Charlie.  \n\nThey also have some decent chain restaurants like Mitchells, Houlihans, Bravo and Panera if you are hungry after watching a flick. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are explosive! When I order for take-out, even after only 10 minutes of a drive in my car, my car ends up smelling like the pizza for 2 full weeks! The antipasto wasn't much to write home about as the house Italian dressing wasn't very flavorful, but the 2 spinach pizzas are AMAZING.  I also just tried the Chicago last night and it was so so good.  Check this place out for eat in or for take-out.  Just expect your car to smell like this stuff for 2 weeks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Extremely quick and easy to deal with. It pays to use them because you can pick your own vehicle style at no extra charge. Much better than Hertz! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and I am happy I did. The store front and decor are completely ordinary, but don't be put off by the lack ambiance. My waiter could not have been more pleasant and yet not overbearing at all. He greeted cheerfully and invited me to choose a table.\n\nI received a complimentary salad of crispy fresh lettuce with ginger dressing. A tasty treat to start. I ordered a spicy yellow tail and spider roll which were both well made and tasty. The rice was done perfectly and the sauces complimented the rolls nicely. \n\nThe price was very reasonable. My lunch with salad and two rolls was $ 14.42.\n\nI've been looking for good sushi in Charlotte and have not been able to find it too often. Today, I did. A definite keeper. I will be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let's be fair to Mike Kwan here & make it clear that this is NOT the worst buffet in Phoenix, much less the world.  For that, you'd have to decide between Hong Kong Restaurant & New Sun Star Super Buffet at Central & Southern!\n\nThe problem here isn't that the food is bad, it's that they don't have anything!  It's a tiny place with just a few hot food choices for $4.86.  Now, I'm not going to complain about the price, but I want salad, so that was it for this place... won't see you there!\n\nIf you want \""cheap\"", whip over to Best Wok Buffet at McDowell & 51st Ave. instead.  It's much better, & it's only $4.25 for lunch, & $4.95 for dinner! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm not really a fan.  The place seems awfully crowded and it is hard to navigate.  What is worse, though, is to charge me $6 for a Red Bull with no liquor.  Bunkhouse usually charges me $2.  The back patio is small and skinny, whereas the usual clientele is not.  It is what it is. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In general I prefer credit unions to banks.  I've moved all my money out of banks into credit unions.  \nThis credit union is the exception.  In short, they stole $10 from me.\nThe long story is, last year I set up a checking account for our family trust.  In the process I was forced to create 2 savings accounts with token amounts of $5 each.  I was told this was a requirement of credit unions.  What I wasn't told was that come this year and the $5 was still there, they confiscated it from both accounts because of \""lack of activity in the account\"". Even though I had nearly 6 figures in the checking account.\nI was not told this when I set this up and I feel I have been robbed!\nBEWARE OF THIS PLACE. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Service A+. Food B-. There was beautiful seating outside next to the herb garden. I had the ribeye topped with Dungeness Crab on a bed of mushrooms and bacon. The steak was ok however; the mushrooms were amazing. My wife had the sea bass which was less than stellar. I gave the overall rating four stars, but the food honestly was about three stars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I remember coming to Kabuto and the chefs would actually entertain you - no matter how old you are. Nowadays, you can't get them to smile at you. I went to lunch with my mother earlier this week and we were appalled at how bad the customer service was. They close at 2pm and as mom and I walked in at 1:15, the hostess assumed we would have the express. We told her we were having the regular hibachi. Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1:15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1:50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2:00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail. I would give Kabuto at least a 4 rating, but I would highly recommend that they work on their customer service first. Hopefully, when I see better results from other patrons on here, I'll be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Dropped in for breakfast with my wife after hearing great things.  The process to order was a bit confusing, but once we connected with one of the cashiers, we figured it all out.  It was a bit of a free for all in the dining room, but we were able to find a seat pretty quickly on a Sunday morning (10:30amish).  \n\nThe food was incredible...seriously.  I ordered the Commuter Sandwich (egg, bacon, tomato on a fresh-baked English Muffin)...it was fresh and it the spot.  My wife ordered the chicken sandwich...very similar experience.  \n\nOrdered a specialty latte as well...very sweet but tasty.  \n\nTrendy place, the music was loud, but we enjoyed ourselves and got out of there in under 45 minutes...even though we took our time.  \n\nI would go back for sure! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I like the idea of Cafe Kopi, but the drink are less then impressive. On the plus side, there's ample seating! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food is very good, not outstanding and they are  pretentious. They seem to be very New York like in terms of seating trendy looking people in the front and parking the Bentley's ou front with lots of orange cones. \n\nOne of the six of us got the wrong dish, but she ate it. Turns out to have been the best dish. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Go on Half Priced Bottle night!\nI went one night with a friend and had a bottle of Elyse \""Korte Ranch\"" Zin for $35!!! I wanted to take one home, but didnt have the guts.\nSushi is always enjoyable, even though it is no longer being prepared at the sushi bar. The Executive Chef, Scott Wallen is super talented and has a great staff in the kitchen, pressing out dishes that just work! Wine list is good, although, at one time a much more \""Seafood Friendly\"" one that has now given way to the big names. Service is always good, but if you really want to have a good time, sit in the bar area! If I could give Upstream a 4.5, I would! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Luckily I don't mind Coke....  I have been here several times and it's been... \""meh\""... but the last time I came through the drive thru and ordered a simple Medium #1 with onion rings.  I thought it was strange that the order taker did not ask what I wanted to drink, but just drove around (figured he would ask me when I got there).... NOPE just handed me a coke.  I try to roll with the punches more-often-than-not, but this was not the end of the world for me.  When I opened the bag, I had fries... and mentioned it to him.  There was no apology and he just went and got the onion rings and handed me the bag back.\n\nI guess  the phrase, \""you get what you pay for\"" applies here.  I will probably give this place another shot since it's right near my house when I need a BK fix, but this is very disappointing in my book. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was having an issue with the emissions light in my car. I spoke with Arlene, who gave me a rundown of what I could expect while my car was in the shop. She then told me that even though they were very busy, I could stop by before my appointment so that Tim could check things out and make sure my car was safe to drive. Tim poked around, figured out it was the gas cap, and sent me on my way without charging. A good mechanic is worth their weight in gold and I will not only return to this garage but refer others as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Brittany, you are a TERRIBLE waitress. You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.\n\nMy friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \""Umm, can we get some service??\"" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. \n\nThis blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \""not seeing\"" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. \n\nMy friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\""Sorry guys.\"" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. \n\nIf you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A great place to get some American Chinese food. This is the best I've found in the valley. I usually order the house chow mein (get ready for some serious broccoli action!) and the peking pork; I am planning on being adventurous and trying spicy next time, since the medium is fairly mild. The service is super fast, and I always go home with leftovers. Their lunch specials are perfectly priced and the portions? Well, they're perfect, too. Get ready to be happy and full. Dinner is a little pricey, so I gave them 4 stars. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cafe Sam has a cool Pittsburgh vibe. It's a bit funky but the food is good and interesting and their menu offers a lot of choices. I went with a group and we all had the Prix Fixe menu. It was a little bit pricey, but I think it was well worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  *Disappointing, uncaring experience.  No follow-up.  Apparent left-hand/right-hand problems in the office, but at least the office staff is pleasant...*\n\nHeard some good things about this practice, so it came to mind when I had a recent medical issue (and needed to find a new PCP).  \n\nI had some flank pain and then days later had an incident of hematuria (rather unsettling and far too much for me to trust my Internet medical degree).  So, I went ahead made an appointment.\n\nScheduling was smooth/friendly.  Got a relatively quick appointment (called on Friday, appointment on Monday) to see the NP at their new location on Thompson Peak.\n\nDay of the appointment, the desk personnel were friendly, the paperwork normal, and the desk personnel pleasant/friendly.   The wait was quite reasonable (pretty close to scheduled time - unusual for a doctor's office).\n\nThe MA was generally friendly and efficient, and the wait for the NP was short.  The NP was professional (though some might not think of her as \""friendly\"" or \""pleasant\"").  As a previous reviewer mentioned, she was laptop-focused and efficient.\n\nLeft a quick sample (verified hematuria w/in a few minutes) and received an order for anti-biotics (to fight off any potential kidney infection) and an ultrasound - and told to try and get one right away (to look for stones).\n\nGot an appointment and took care of the ultrasound that afternoon.\n\nThe following evening I experienced some pretty severe flank pain in the middle of the night, but it subsided on its own.  I logged into their patient portal and left a note to that effect.\n\nTwo days later, not having heard anything back (odd as the radiologist's office indicated results would be sent to my PCP next day), I called the office at around 1:45p, and was told that the NP had not reviewed the results yet, but that they would take my callback number and send her message to review the ultrasound.\n\nAt first, I was kind of annoyed, but then, I was actually kinda of happy to hear that it wasn't a priority (must not be that bad).\n\nLater that afternoon (~5:30p), I receive a message via their patient portal from the NP asking if I had gotten an ultrasound and rather curtly telling me that I really need to go get that ultrasound...  HUH?\n\nSo, I sent a reply letting her know that I had gotten the ultrasound and contacted the office earlier that afternoon.\n\nThe next day, I get a call from a pleasant person from their office (not an NP or doctor) letting me know that a doctor had reviewed the ultrasound, and it was clear/normal (no cysts or stones).  OK - cool.  So, of course, I asked, great, what next?  I'd really like to get to the bottom of this... And the answer was literally, \""Well, I don't know, but at least the ultrasound was clear!\"" (and I could hear the very genuine smile on the other end).\n\nIt has been 3 days, no response to the message I sent in reply in the patient portal.  No follow-up.  No posting of the ultrasound results to the patient portal.  Nothing.  Silence.\n\nMaybe my expectations are skewed, as I have been somewhat fortunate in never having any real medical issue to date, but when I see myself pissing blood and have unexplained flank pain, I really, really wanna understand why - and I kinda feel like my care provider would generally follow-up quickly on something like this - or at least tell me if there's nothing to follow-up on.   \n\nReally.  You don't even have to call me.  I like technology.  Use your patient portal and copy+paste your notes... Really.\n\nAt the end of the day, I suppose I'm responsible for my own well-being though, and so I will.  I've got an appointment with a new doctor tomorrow afternoon :-).  Maybe it's nothing.  Maybe it's something, but I'll keep looking until I find a care provider that can/would-like-to help me find out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\n\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\n\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\n\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\n\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\n\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \n\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'd give it 4 stars for the margaritas and the service. Our server was really nice and attentive. \n\nThe food though, has much to be desired. Last night we went there and I got chicken tacos. They were so horrible that I only took one bite. My friend got the same thing and she also didn't eat more than one bite. They were that bad. The chicken tasted like it was canned. \n\nThe chips are good and the salsa isn't too bad either. They're generous with the chips and keep them coming, good thing too since that's what I ate for dinner since my tacos stunk. \n\nGood place to go if you're just looking for 'ritas and chips. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  While my food was great,  I definately didnt enjoy the service.  We waited and waited and waited 45 mins for our food & drinks.  I felt like our waitress forgot we were there.  However she was super attentive when it was time for us to pay... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For a really sunny place, this airport is very dark; the drop off point looks old and dark, the check in counters are dark (except for the lighting, of course). Is it to shield from the intense sun? It might be kinda nice to leverage the sun a little?\n\nAnyway. What really scared me were the BIRDS in the Southwest terminal. The staff seemed to think that it was funny to have a swarm of sparrows flittering around in the waiting area. Disgusting and Dirty. \n\nOtherwise, adequate airport, pretty fast lines and ok food choices <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There is no surprise this hotel is #1. The property is amazing. Location is perfect. Service is outstanding. Food is delicious. The Spa offers some of the best services Ive ever had. Cant wait to go back!\nNote: Service charges are included with everything including your car service, so no need to tip! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Costco, I love you.\n\nMy family and I have been going to this Costco since it was \""Price Club\"" --- whoa, that's a long time. At least 15 years. \n\nThe service here is consistently wonderful-- and what is even more amazing is that there are employees who are still there after all of this time. That tells you something.\n\nCostco is the best pharmacy around. So much cheaper than other pharmacies. They get my vote every time.\n\nBut today, I am giving a specific shout out to the two wireless kiosk phone guys. I had a couple of questions about my contract, which they answered. My phone had started to die while I talkd to them, and I asked if they had an extra charger that I could borrow while we spoke. Sure enough, they plugged it in, answered my questions and gave me some extra information. A+ for customer service on that one. My phone lasted just long enough to get me home. When I need an upgrade for my phone, I will DEFINITELY be coming back to visit them.\n\nPS: The Kirkland brand cranberry and macadamia nut cereal is delightful. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow, I have never received such crappy service in my life. The Barista must've worked for the welfare office or dmv, or another city service job, cause her attitude showed. Sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for. Avoid this location, either go to the on on camelback or 7 st. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant bringing 8 out of town guests from across the country. The food was outstanding and the wait staff is very accommodating. Alex made a special effort to make sure our time there was enjoyable. Good authentic Italian cuisine at a very reasonable price. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My partner and I came with two friends who were from out-of-town. I had heard really good things about Blue Plate, and I wanted to try it out, but I wish we had left when we saw there was a wait.\n\nWe ended up waiting for a table for around 45 minutes. While waiting I had to use the restroom--disgusting. There was no soap in the dispenser, water all over the counter and floor, and paper towels crumpled everywhere. I realize this is largely because of the patrons, but you would expect somebody from the staff to pop in every once in a while to make sure everything is neat and in stock. \n\nWhen we finally got a table, service was rushed and impersonal. I was a little dismayed that a manager never came over to at least thank us for waiting for so long, but who knows if a manager was even there? It seemed totally chaotic and like nobody was in charge. Lunch was okay, but nothing special. I had an omelette that was pretty good, but the breakfast potatoes that it came with were soggy, and while some of the potatoes were heavily seasoned, others didn't have any seasoning on them whatsoever and tasted horribly bland. I also had to wait several minutes before I could even eat because the server who delivered the plates (not our server, who spent approximately two minutes at our table in total) brought everyone else's meals out first and left mine in the kitchen. \n\nWill not be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to say, I am pretty disappointed in Yelp and their usually unnecessary Filtering.   \nScroll down to the 13 FILTERED reviews.. all of but 1 are 1 star. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Arrived, party of 6 on a Wednesday night. Host would not acknowledge our presence, wasted :30 mins of our time figuring out whether we could get a table or not.\n\nTerrible service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Before you bother, CASH only, so bring your ones.  You won't need much more beyond that.\n\nHB's is a decent bar esteemed by my Midwestern friends because (*shocker*), it reminds them of something that could have been 'back home'.  Oh Jesus.  Can we petition to have a moratorium on this phrase for anyone coming to Phoenix from between the geographical regions presented by the Mississippi and the Appalachains?  \n\nNaturally, then, this place looks like a lodge in Duluth, with glossy wood, pool tables, darts, and other bar olympics that seem to occupy the minds of the fly over population.  \n\nNot bad really.  Just nothing particularly special.  I've had plenty of drinks in here, and never once was I tapping to leave.  Its just a natural progression to leave this bar after you've championed your beer or your cricket group.  \n\nWhats appropriately odd about this bar, I might add, is their remarkable and diverse juke box selection.  I can't stride over to the bartender without depositing a couple of dollars of The Cure for the townies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First problem:  Dear god I was taken aback by the menu prices when I first sat down.  Almost everything was well over $10 per meal, even the staple stuff.  I mean you'd think that since Nitaya's in a \""college town\"" the prices would reflect the clientele that they're going to attract.  \n\nSecond problem:  No leftovers.  I was hungry but there's a universal understanding that Thai food portions should ALWAYS be big enough to make at least two meals out of.  That is a fact and Nitaya, to quote The Dude \""YOU FUCKED IT UP!  YOU FUCKED IT UP!\""\n\nLone positive:  As much as I bitch and moan, the Pad See Ewe was kind of really good and at the perfect level of spiciness. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Bell location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They have one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I have never had anything bad here. Great meat products, just don't get the sausage patties. They are not of high quality, but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good, but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed, it is always packed, and there is always a wait. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wish I would have consulted Yelp before dining here... \n\nI'm new to the area, and drive past this place quite often, and thought I'd give their Sunday brunch a try. Big mistake. The food was awful. With the exception of the salad bar and fresh fruit, everything tasted and looked like it had been previously frozen or canned. \n\nSimply put - I've had continental breakfasts at the Holiday Inn that were better.\n\nOur waiter was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Too bad the food wasn't. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Looks like I am not the only one that had a poor experience at this UPS store. I went in to ship a package that I needed to return to Amazon. The owner barely glanced at my package, told me the box I had was \""too big for the item,\"" and that I would need to purchase one from him for $6.95. I'm not sure how the box could have been \""too big,\"" if it was the same box Amazon used to ship the item to me. I had even added my own bubble wrap, just to be sure the item was secure. The owner was very confrontational during the entire exchange. I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and said maybe he was just having a bad day, but judging by these other reviews, he is ALWAYS having a bad day. I left with my package and I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals, I went over to see the cat. The cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention. I picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me. I will NEVER NEVER go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way. The shop isn't that great anyway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have visited the Casey Jones pub 3 times over the past year or so whenever I visit my mother who lives in Phoenix. Everytime I go I have had a great time! Take for instance this past weekend, they had UFC 116 on for free. Not many places in California even show the fights and they definitely are not free! Also after 10 p.m they have $1.50 small pitchers of domestics. SOOO that speaks for itself!! The food is typical barfood but it is very good so you can't go wrong there.  I will continue to go here whenever I come to phoenix!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Super super strong drinks. Very smoky and small, but definitely worth coming to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love coffee and any place that serves it. Shadyside is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, especially on a Saturday afternoon. It's very alive and animated with people everywhere! I personally love window shopping at the Apple Store, but that's a different story. \n\nMy girlfriends and I met on Saturday for a little shopping and lunch, and while we were waiting for our one friend, we hopped into the Coffee Tree for a morning tea. They have an awesome tea selection, and I had their organic citrus green tea. The layout is great inside - a lot of tables, and outlets for the laptop users. Up one level, they have couches by a fireplace, and finally in the back they have a closed-in meeting room available for groups. Great location - great tea. It was perfect for the brisk, sunny Saturday morning walk down Walnut. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!\n\nI'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really love this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was last the the Mimosa Grill a few weeks ago while visiting Charlotte on business. It was pouring outside, so to was very nice to be out of the rain and be immediately greeted by the welcoming decor. We were quickly seated by our very pleasant host and our waitress briefed us on the specials for the evening. I asked for a recommendation on a cheese selection her choice of a local goat cheese was fabulous. For the entree I chose the New York Strip Pepper Steak and it was prepared perfectly. A glass of Beringer Reserve Cabernet went very well with the meal. I have been to the Mimosa Grill a few other times in the past and have always been pleased with the entire evening, and this was no exception. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been using this salon exclusively for the past six or seven years because of how Rose the owner and her staff treat me. I've never had to redo a single nail - and over the years I've tried everything! Don't let the poor reviewers stop you from visiting this shop. Just expect to wait because she's busy with repeat customers. And new ones. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My boyfriend and I came here to have breakfast after New Years. We weren't expecting much being not at our best either. \n\nThe service, as mentioned several times in yelp, is really slow. My drink was forgotten about and the next time our waitress came around she was serving our meal about 30-40 minutes from taking our order. The restaurant was probably half full of people. My boyfriends meal was mediocre \""at best\"" as he put it but my meal was worse. My bacon and egg omelette was burnt and the cheese was scarce. \n\nAt the end of our meal, our server still charged us for the missing drink but they were kind enough to take it off the bill, that is while we waited 10 minutes standing at the register. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant because I think my time is worth more than they treated it but could be nice for those who think differently. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Ultimate Yelp Party 2011 was a smash hit. Great Food....Great Drinks....Great Music....Great Exhibits...Great Entertainment....Great Activities.....Great Staff.....Did I say everything was great.....LOL....Well I have to say I had a GREAT time as well. There is nothing in the world quite like a Yelp party....and once again the staffers at Yelp did not disappoint. Now the only reason I gave it 4 stars had nothing to do with the establishment.....or any of the other GREAT things I mentioned earlier...I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because we had to pay for parking which we didn't have to do at the Botanical Gardens last year.....and Secondly because the Botanical Gardens Party last year was GREAT....GREAT....and REALLY GREAT. Now with all that being said Yelp done a great job as usual....and I am looking forward to Next year's Ultimate Yelp Party. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pricey repairs for air conditioning.  Being the good Union wife that I am, when my mothers a/c went out, I opted for a union company to do the repair.  It was a Friday afternoon, about 2:30, and was told that there would be after hours charge for coming out to repair unit.  Not thrilled, but ok.  Todd was very friendly and did a good job fixing the problem, but the price of the bill was incredible.  We were charged $196 to look up the part number and to pick it up.  I found a coupon to use for $75 off, and still paid $520 for the repair.  When I went home that evening, I found that the a/c at my house had failed as well.  When it rains, it pours.  Turned out to be the same part that my Mom had to have replaced on her unit.  My husband was able to fix our unit for $18.  Too bad he was at work on Friday, and not available to look at the a/c at Mom's.  After talking to several people within the company, we are being refunded the after hours charge of $99.   Unless you're eager to throw away good money on repairs, I'd look into a different company. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went there Friday night to try it out on the recommendation of so many Yelpers.  The place was neat and clean and the wait staff most friendly.  We immediately received chips with salsa and curtido( a type of coleslaw.) Didn't really like the curtido, lacked vinegar and some herbs.  But the chips were amazing.: warm, crispy and not greasy.  Nice start. I order the pork chop with plantain, rice mixed with frijoles and salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful, but being a really good cook of latin food I am going to make this recommendation to the cook.  Never add tomato sauce to rice because it makes the absorption of water difficult and makes the rice sticky.  Use Goya's Sason for coloring or tumeric.  That said, my significant other ordered the baked fish dish (because HE is watching is girlish figure) with plantains and salad.  He really enjoyed it.  I ordered a pupusa because I had never, ever, ever had one.  I ordered the one with pork cracklings, beans and cheese.  It was good.  By the way, both entrees can with a side order of pupusa.   Too full to try dessert but they had some interestingly delicious offering. \nI think the meal was worth the money.  Try it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm from New Mexico, and being right next door, you think it would be easy to get some familiar grub. Not so! Unless I'm headed over to my mom's for dinner, my quest for food familiar to my taste buds has pretty much been a bust.\n\nAlthough it's kind of weird to have a bunch of koi fish in a too-shallow, too-small space right when you walk in, that (and the fact that Rosita's is, indeed, in a sketchy part of town) is the only detraction.\n\nThe food isn't New Mexican, but it is yummy. I've eaten here several times. The tacos are okay. The chicken flautas come loaded with tons of sour cream and guacamole.  A friend of mine says that you can tell the quality of a place by their rice and beans, and Rosita's doesn't disappoint.\n\nWhere Rosita's shines, though, is in its soups and green chile meat dishes. Go starting in October for the best posole. Or order the green chile burrito, enchilada style. The chile isn't for wimps, and the meat is tender and melts in your mouth. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Only one word comes to mind about this place \""OVERRATED\"" i ordered the sausage with extra sauce, the extra sauce was spread around the top of the pizza...COLD which made the pizza disgusting already the sausage was nothing to write home about. good service i suppose and that's the only reason i'm not giving it 1 star, as far as Chicago Style goes i think Johnnie's pizza is light years ahead. Not worth it if your in that shopping center and you must eat just go to Codfathers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The decor is really nice and the food is amazing. After traveling Italy for four months I would still say that the gnocchi here is incredible! The only thing I didn't like was the lack of attention to the bathroom floors, the amount of dust collecting was disgusting. Everything else was great including the amazing white bean appetizer with olive oil and fresh bread. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My cab was 30 minutes late -  I didn't receive a heads up from dispatch,  and they were reluctant to give me an  estimated arrival time. I almost missed my flight and will not be taking Union cab again. <|endoftext|>

The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!\n\nService is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee and/or tea!\n\nAll the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  \n\n\nThey also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.\n\nThe first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.\n\n I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Mike N Molly's has a great atmosphere on the outdoor patio, a surprisingly good beer list, and decent specials. Yes, brews on tap could be more plentiful, but it's as good as Champaign gets if you're looking for a beer garden. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am extremely disappointed.  I have been going here since November and today was horrible. I left with 2 finger bleeding, 2 nails on crooked and skimpy polish.  I am definitely in search of a new nail salon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to RiRa for dinner on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly good. My husband and I sat at the long bar, while a fire roared behind us and the NFL playoffs were shown on the one television.  \n\nI rarely order burgers but was enticed by the Guinness BBQ Burger, figuring that it would be impossible not to pair well with my frothy pint of Guinness. I don't usually order burgers since they rarely meet my high expectations of a well seasoned, juicy, not-too-big-but-not-too-small beef patty, but RiRa delivered on all counts. I scarfed the burger, leaving little room for the good, but not great fries. My husband was very happy with his burger, which was some sort of super-spicy special and apparently left his mouth satisfyingly aflame. \n\nWe'll be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Fuck this airport. TPA represent! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dave goes to New Mexico part 1.\n\nWell, I already reviewed my home airport - John Wayne, so I will say that I started my long travel day there after the quick drive from home. John Wayne was, as always, clean and pretty efficient.\n\nMy plane landed at Phoenix Sky Harbor at about 10:00.  I was meeting my boss who was coming in from Ontario.  We were heading to New Mexico.  We had about 90 minutes to kill in Phoenix.\n\nThe restaurants are pretty slim pickings inside security at Phoenix.  My boss needed a pair of sunglasses since she forgot hers.  There was no place to buy sunglasses inside security.  Neither of us wanted to leave the secure area because of the lines to get back to the gates.  We just decided to try to find some seats and wait out or layover.\n\nNot my favorite airport experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best bar on Walnut.\nGo here anytime of day,\nThey will have your fix.\n\n(b) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yeah, don't order from here, unless it's for dumplings. since they arev fast and the potstickers are really good. Everything else we had sucked. Shrimp and Scallop with garlic was bland as hell. The Beef on a Stick was liked eating a marinated shoe with a skewer in it. Yuk. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been to Rolands a few times and have not experienced any of the problems others are saying they have, however, I'm only giving 2 stars because you're in the strip-you can do better than Rolands! I was most recently at Rolands during the steeler season last year. I ordered the crab chowder which I have had every time I have been there and each time it has been excellent. On this most recent visit I ordered the raspberry maple scallop appetizer as my meal. It was a large portion;I could not finish it and my fellow diners were too stuffed to help me. One member of my group ordered the seafood pizza and crushed it-said it was so tasty. My other fellow diner order the stuffed banana pepper app and also said it was good. They have a wide draft selection and if you get there early enough you can grab a seat near the tvs. The bar is usually too crowded to grab a seat at but our service at our table was attentive and quick. On a previous visit, I split a margarita pizza and it was good too so there is a variety of entrees/apps etc to choose from to please any palate. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend. the restaurant is a fairly good size and we were there around 1145. it was so slow, maybe 15 people in the whole place. we ordered 2 rolls and 45 minutes later still no rolls. i stopped the server asked him what had happened to our food and he said \""its out of my hands\"" i ask for a manager, he goes to the back to get her she goes to the sushi bar and this other lady comes over to us. she said well what do you want to do? get your food and go or just go? she was incredibly rude but we ended up getting the rolls about 15 minutes later and she says \""hey thanks guys\"". WHAT?! She was the WORST manager i have ever seen deal with a bad situation, had no realization at all for customer service, none. i know we will never ever go back here again! oh yeah and when we went to eat the food, the order was wrong! ridiculous. worst sushi place, ever! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot.\nReally enjoyed the Pacifico on tap ($4.25/glass) and the Nachos gustivo pequeno ($9.00 for small).\nA bit pricey but still a fun place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Love the stars!  But you can get them online cheaper.  The other lighting that they carry is WAY overpriced and quite antiquated. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After coming here 2-3 times a week for about 7 years - I think i have the lay of the land...\n\nI get food fast, food is good enough, always cheap, never had a problem, very well managed.\n\nI could eat bean burritos pretty much every day - and some weeks, I do. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went to The Club this morning for Sunday brunch (which we normally do). Usually have eggs/bacon/muffin or toast but today splurged on French toast. Was VERY good - Love my French toast crispy and this totally hit the spot. We always ask for our bacon crispy, and today's was no exception. We also stopped in Wednesday for Bingo/Trivia night. I thought I was good on trivia, but Moose came up with stumpers I couldn't even find on my phone on Google - but others got them. We had burgers that night and they were great. Exactly what we ordered. Even the onion rings were hot and quite tasty.\n\nWait staff is a hoot - they enjoy shaking things up with different songs that all present can enjoy - who doesn't like Muppets doing Queen's \""Bohemian Rhapsody\""?? They're all very accommodating with tv channel change requests, please turn up/down the music, etc.\n\nBEST NIGHT TO GO: Badger Band Concert Day in April! The Club gets a bus for Thursday night's concert and you are fed a catered dinner prior to boarding. There's way too much food and it's all really good - don't get me started on the Jambalaya! - whole thing is a great deal.\n\nMy husband and I have enjoyed The Club for years ... and will continue to. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A classic old-school joint. The bar dates back I don't know how long. And the service has that old-school quality. I wanted for nothing. I was stuffed by the burger they served me. It was tasty and delicious. I can't wait to go back and enjoy another. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We visited the stand for this restaurant at the farmer's market downtown.  We sampled their zucchini lasagna, eggplant lasagna, two kinds of eggplant rollatini, meatballs, peppers and sausage and bruschetta.  Overall, I was really impressed, and it can be difficult to impress me with Italian food.  Their eggplant and zucchini were sliced so thin that they practically melted in your mouth, which is my favorite way to eat it.\n\nWe ended up buying some rollatini and zucchini lasagna to take home, and we're curious about trying out the restaurant sometime soon.  More to follow... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pretty good Thai, though slightly overrated. Hit and miss, with the curries more solid than anything else I've tried. Enormous portions.\n\nAmbience is very open and casual but somehow still pretty \""nice\"". Seating is never an issue.\n\nIt's good to have more BYOB options. Go here with some friends casually, bring a growler or a couple of bombers, have a good relaxed time. Overall, I'm a fan, but wish my friends would want to go here less often. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Absolutely, the best gyro that I have ever eaten, and I have eaten a lot of them over the years.  I miss you Zorba's! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was the hotel my wedding party and I stayed in the weekend of my wedding. We figured it was the best choice since it was right next door to the reception venue and it was very inexpensive. The highs and lows of the hotel equal out to a solid 3.5.\n\nI booked one of the \""penthouse\"" suites. It had 2 queen beds and one sofa bed in the sitting room. For the night before the wedding I thought this would be perfect for my mom, sister, and niece. Except the sofa bed didn't work and was actually a safety hazard. We almost got killed trying to pull it off. We called the front desk trying to get a roll a way for my poor Mama but they said the roll a ways were locked up because house keepers left and they are the only ones that have the keys. ??? My mom ended up sleeping on the couch. \n\nNo major problems other than the broken sofa bed. It is not super nice looking, and the decor in boring and outdated. However, it is a good size and very convenient. The bathroom was oddly large and included a huge tub. The balcony was spacious. Our room looked over north Phoenix and was directly above the Irish Cultural Center, which was our reception site. It was great to be able to watch the set up from our balcony. \n\nThe staff was very nice. They were also apologetic about some of the conditions of the property. My sisters asked some of the staff to decorate our suite for our wedding night, and after the reception we were surprised by candles everywhere in our room and a bottle of champagne! Very sweet. \n\nOverall I am pleased with our stay at the hotel. It is old, outdated, and definitely not fancy, but when it comes to value, convenience, and location it can't be beat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First time visting this place.  Ordered the burrito with chicken ( had to pay extra 25 cents thought that was different and beef taco.  I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.  The chicken and beef had no seasoning that I could taste at all.\n\nThe refried beans was like sauce.  Well the service was fine.  I was hoping for more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This company constantly harasses us by calling every week. We have told them to stop. 6027491677 is the number they call from. Their way of gaining customers is horrible. I honestly would get service from them when I need it, but now that they have bullied us with phone calls, I want nothing to do with their company. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There's only one Sams on the Northside and whenever you go in there on a Sunday, it's going to be crowded. With that being accepted it took me at least 20 - 30 min to get thru check out and out the door. \n\nThey do have the best Cinnamon pretzels, however, there's usually always just 1 person working or taking orders in the cafe. I mean it is super busy after church, so I wish they would have more people working there. Plus a lot of people get the large pizzas (which are comparable to delivery pizza or frozen store bought) to take home,  but still only 1 worker. \n\nAlso, they don't accept all major credit cards, which is odd. Of course, I will keep going because there's not another closer. However, BJ's is worth a trip too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wally's is kind of hidden gem tucked away in a shopping center on 44th Street and Camelback.  There's nothing like an evening meal on their comfortable patio after the sun has set. The patio is dog friendly as well. I've been here a few times and really have enjoyed everything I have ordered; my favorite is the Cuban Sandwich. My wife loves the Chicken Sandwich with the Brie cheese.\n\nLast time I was there, they forgot to send a server to our table for about 10 minutes. The Manager took responsibility for the oversight and offered my wife and I dessert on the house. We decided to share a creme brulee, which was excellent. That was definitely a case of turning a lemon into lemonade in my book.\n\nIt's definitely been too long since I've been to Wally's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start off by saying, I HATE the dentist.  It is my worst fear.  I came to Edgewood Dental after stellar reviews.. and let me tell you my first impression was amazing.  They were professional, so nice, easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that I didn't feel a thing.  Although I had 7 cavities filled (my teeth are horrible) I felt good that they did a good job.  Flash forward 3 months later, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings.  First, I was very upset that I was never told of this downgrade.  I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.  Meanwhile, I have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill.  I have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word.  Jerks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When my favorite lamp stopped working, I went to Lighting by Erik because they were close to my home. I was initially pleased by the private parking lot as parking can be an issue in that area. The service I received was outstanding.. I was told that I could save about $30 by fixing the lamp myself, and was directed to the technicion who quickly showed me the parts and how to do the repair. I was very impressed by his expertise and customer service, and learned he has been doing this for 45 years. They really went out of their way to help me out on the spot, and it made my morning. I was also impressed by their chandelier selection and will definitely visit again to shop. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I LOVE Whole Foods as a company, but this has got to be one of the worst locations in AZ. Maybe I'm spoiled with the shelf space and layout of the one on Mayo in Scottsdale (a flagship store built in 2008), but this Shea store is about a third of the size, if that. EVERY time I have gone there (it's much closer to me than the Mayo location), they NEVER have what I need. Whether it's a type of hummus, cosmetic, vitamin, flax oil, it's never there like it is on Mayo. They just don't have the shelf space.\n\nToday, I tried one more time for Barlean's flax oil. Oh, they had it, but the 16oz sizes had been sitting on the shelf since November (it says on the bottles when they are created) and due to expire in one month. Shows how little product they move. They just don't have the customer turnover. I looked for a hummus they had at the Mayo location and they didn't carry that either. When I asked about the brand, they tried to sell me something else that I didn't want. Weak. \n\nMy other major complaint and apparently it is a common one according to the staff, is that they have a HUGE display of bath salts (open) and soaps sitting out near all the food smack in the middle of the store. If you want flax oil, you'd better be good at holding your breath. It was so strong that just from walking through the area once, my boyfriend asked me \""what is that smell, it smells like cheap perfume soap or something\"" on me when I got home. Wow. It's really bad for anyone with perfume sensitivities which is a lot of people in AZ, one of the worst allergy zones in the country. \n\nI mean, Whole Foods is supposed to be a mecca of health, not stench and inconvenience. \n\nThis long-time customer will be exclusively shopping (and dropping lots of cash) at Mayo from now on. I'm tired of wasting my time and breathing the fumes at Shea. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I did some research, saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken, biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley.\n\nI went for breakfast.  The service was fast, but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes.  The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible, it just wasnt great. \n\nIf you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'd really say its about 2.5 stars. It wasn't horrible but it was definitely forgettable.\n\nThe place smells dirty. Greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty. The decor is 70s kitschy, and that's okay. But the real reason I go out is for good food and to be served.\n\nI thought the prices were high for the food quality. $12.95 for spaghetti? Really?  The tomato gravy was okay. Thick and sweet. It would be good on pizza. But they don't use enough mozzarella in their various dishes, garlic seems largely absent, and the food was tepid. (I had the baked lasagna.)\n\nWhen we arrived it wasn't busy, but the service was sub par. Then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent. It's a pity too, because I love independent, non-chains and try to frequent those establishments. But frankly, next time, I'll go to the Olive Garden. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love ordering take-out from Chili's on days when I'm too lazy to cook something but I want food that's better than fast food.  The online ordering experience is simple.  The pick-up is convenient and right inside the back door.\n\nPlus, their chips and salsa have me hooked for life.  I could snack on those for HOURS! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been going to A Desert Song for now over 16 years since it was at the 16th street location. The staff are very dedicated to their craft and will help anyone, at any level. I would recommend the intro series for the new students, or the basics class. The staff will get to know you by name, and personally help you. Even in a large class you may feel like you are having a private yoga session, especially with the owner Mary Beth.\nAs others have mentioned, this place is truly a breath of fresh air in Phoenix. When I am tense all I need to do is go to yoga and it all washes away. If I need some deeper intervention, desert song is hands down the best place to get a massage in the valley. The practitioners can root out your stress and rub it all away. After a massage here I feel as if all of my stressors in life have magically disappeared. There's nothing that even comes close. They've ruined me for everything else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I guess when you grow up eating authentic Indian food, the bar gets set pretty high.  Maharani was not at all what I'd hoped for.  The food was bland, under-seasoned and the woman working the door seemed not to care much that we bothered walking in.  \n\nThe decor is old and drab, the entire place having a rather sad mood.  Someone needs to wake up, update, and start cooking with passion.\n\nLife is too short.  Go elsewhere until that happens. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We just ate here for the 1st time today and it was really good. The food is great and I couldn't believe the cheap prices.  Its definitely a hole in the wall but the staff is very friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \""thank you\"" and \""how are you\"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is probably my favorite store in Pittsburgh, for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing. Other stores carry the same stuff but for much, much more, and it's hard to find all the stuff that the Basement carries in one spot. (Yes, I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was very shocked to see that my review from yesterday had been hidden! What is the point of this website if people can't write their opinion? Obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurant's yelp site didn't want people to see how POORLY my children and I were treated at this establishment. A friend of mine and our 3 little boys (two of them babies) came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down. It was quite ridiculous and offensive, seeing that two of the children are ONE year. Yes sir, let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude. I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue, my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty. Also, a note to whomever this concerns in management in control of this site: if you take my post down again, I will continue to write this review. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  As early 90's rapper Tone-Loc once said \""Let's do it.\""\n\nUnless you have spent your first 20 years or so in a subterranean nuclear fall out bunker, odds are you know of Ruth's Chris. The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The food is excellent.  The service is average and the place is over priced.  BUT THE FOOD IS GGGGGGGRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you were to add up the amount of time I spent at Murphy's in college, it would probably be close to the total time I spent in class.  Even today, this haunt is still our campus favorite when down in CU for a football/basketball/hockey game.  \n\nBack in my day, they didn't have the new addition but having the additional space makes it much easier to get a table and some space to move around without affecting the divey-campus bar feel.  Wednesday is Logo Glass Night, and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years.\n\nTheir beers on tap is great, especially for a campus bar.  The food is pretty good pub grub, but I believe there is a \""game-day menu\"" where only certain things are served, which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game-day because it's not on the menu.  The jukebox is great (every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there) and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on.  If you get there early, you won't even have to pay a cover. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good food, pretty hard to find.  We were visiting from out of state and felt like Mexican.  So I found this restaurant with an app and it took a while walking up and down the block before we realized it was inside another building.  Even then, you have to search for it as it is tucked away.\n\nAnyway, once we found it we were pleased with the choice.  The burritos get to be pretty big and filling and the salads (my wife had the salad) is also large.  The chicken had good flavor and just a hint of spice.  The overall price was very good for the amount of food you get.  There was a long line and I now understand why, good food for a good price.  Also, the sweet tea is delicious if you like it pretty sweet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  These reviews are sort of confusing me.  I went there today and had a really great manicure and it was pretty cheap ($12).  However, next time you're there...I urge you to look at the floor by the pedicure chairs.  There is an enormous amount of toe-nail clippings.  Eew. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you're coming in here for a burrito, you're better off walking that extra block and getting one at Chipotle. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Lidia's is a good restaurant for Italy food.  Though there is little bit loud, food here are really awesome. \n$6 is needed for valet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Have been here innumberable times:  Consistently high quality product, service, and reasonable prices.  The place is always very clean, and  they don't mind me lounging with a magazine or the Trib long after I've finished.  Price is reasonable, and the meat quality is the best in town.  Li'l Porgy's may slightly have an edge if you like sweet sauce, but I am a fan of HR.  Great place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been expecting this place to get better whenever I go there, but each time has brought a bad experience. The first time, I had a horribly rude waitress and slow service. The food was mediocre. The second time, I had a great meal with the enchiladas and good service, but my significant other had to ask to take the food back once, and almost a second time, too! For a Mexican food place in the middle of Phoenix, one would expect authentic and flavorful cuisine,  but this place is far from it and overpriced to add. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We went to the OSF last night before the Suns game and it was another great experience. I love that it's on the light rail path so that you can hop off, eat, and get back on and head downtown. The service is always friendly and you always get a hearty meal at a good price! The hot out of the oven sourdough bread is the best!! If anything come for the bread. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Copenhagen was a great find. Even though we have seen it about 100 times driving up and down Camelback. Best selection of sofas we have seen to date. Great selection of contemporary classics and Natuzzi.\n\nThey also have a more affordable section called Denmark. We finally found our sofa and chair! Great price and the service was the perfect combination of helpful and respectful of our space. \n\nWe will shop here first for all of our home furnishings! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Convenience was the only factor when choosing to come here for past car washes and, most recently, an oil change. There's something overwhelming about the amount of people that swarm your car the minute you pull up and repeatedly try to sell you additional services without your solicitation. \n\nOne of the employees asked for my phone number and I asked why he needed it. \""In case we have to up-sell you or return your car,\"" was his response. Reluctantly I gave it and sure enough I received a call while I was grocery shopping and waiting. The employee asked me if I wanted additional services after I already said no. I insisted \""no\"" and he still persisted. Very frustrating.\n\nAfter the carwash, there was oil all over the inside of my car and I had to ask the employee to wipe the writing off my windshield which obstructed my view. \n\nI will drive the distance for a better place in the future. Convenience is no longer worth the compromised service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  not happy with this dealership because you cant reach anyone in service and it goes straight to the answering machine and then they never return your calls. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been going to this place for the longest time.  Not only is it near my house, but the polish lasts awhile.  I have been to other places where the polish washed off the next day.  These people are nice and remember my mother and I everytime.  They even remember what type of style I  like my nails to be done.  I definately like this place <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!\nTheir food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Blue Fin has awesome Teriyaki Bowls and daily specials for under $10. The portions are large and you will even have leftovers. I am a big fan. The menu is a bit limited, but has good customer service and short wait times. Took off one star for limited seating- it is very busy and I would like to have more table space/options. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am so happy they aren't keeping this crab and scallop \""pot\"".  It was overly messy and no return of flavor.  Better off just having steamed crab legs instead.  Overall, Red Lobster is a great place for me to get my crab fix when I need it.  There isn't any other affordable place in town to support my cravings. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work, went to the office and she did not even check my name!!!!.... Waited for the shuttle around 40 min at the airport.  Not even friendly people working there... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We stayed here for the recent Phoenix Rock and Roll marathon.  The hotel itself is \""boutique\"" as the website says, yet it has paper thin walls and we could hear the drunk people come home at 2am the night before our 8am race.  In addition, this hotel was listed on the race website as a good place to stay, YET when we returned back from the race (which ends in Tempe and requires a 45 min train ride back), our hotel room door was locked with our stuff inside.  We were then charged an additional \""1/2 day\"" fee in order to get our stuff out and shower rather than having a late check out.  There is a Hyatt and a Westin near by ...stay there!!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Andy the Sushi Guy.  \nFast, entertaining, friendly and did I say fast?  No worries about standing in line and taking a few minutes of your busy day to watch Andy work his magic.  After all, it's not often one can find a fresh fish market with the freshest sushi ingredients. And you can bet Andy the Sushi Guy won't skimp on ingredients.  \nWe stopped by on Saturday about lunchtime when Wholey's is packed with its Saturday shoppers, which is it's usual crowded busy-ness.  Andy's Special for the day:  Tuna & Kiwi  or  Salmon & Avocado FAT Rolls.  Yes, the special of the day is usually a FUTO maki extraordinaire.  \nWe ordered the Tuna & Kiwi and Andy's Sushi Combo.  \nTuna & Kiwi began with crispy dried nori (seaweed) topped with an ample amount of fluffy sushi rice.  Smeared on is Tobiko (flying fish eggs) with its bright orange color. Just as you're admiring his steadfastness, POP goes the rice ladened seaweed as  Andy flips the seaweed to create a reverse sushi roll.  Folks, I'd have to disagree with another Yelper when they say that nori goes on the outside. What's not to like about creativity? And personally, what's not to like about more ingredients that you can stick on the outside of a sushi roll?  Like Tobiko or sesame seeds? hhmm...???? \nContinuing with the innerds of the Tuna & Kiwi roll, more Tobiko, asparagus, seared tuna with a light breading, red leafed lettuce, fresh tuna and kiwi...a la Andy's Special of the day.  Roll up all of these and keeping it in tact so when the slicing begins, all of the innerds remain in tact. Whoosh!  Did you see how he picked up the whole futomaki (fat roll) and placed it in the clear togo container, fan it out, add an ample handful of shyoga (thinly sliced pickled ginger) and a hunk of wasabi (no explanation needed) with soy sauce in a mini condiment cup. Sushi a la Andy the Sushi Guy at Wholey's~~It's what's for dinner!\nIf Andy didn't cut the roll, it would take two hands to pick it up and eat it like a ginormous fat burrito, kinda like you'd get in one of them hole in the wall Tex-Mex joints down close to the border (the US Border, that is).  But it is cut into yummy 8 slices and is done quickly without smushing down the circular form. Instead, admire the sliced sushi serving as you lay it flat and be amazed at the color and textures of the ingredients. Not only does it have fresh fish, but some veggies to add to your daily vitamin intake.  \nThe only 'drawback' and I think that is what some of the sushi connoisseurs are quick to point out, is that the sushi rice is not seasoned.  Yes, folks, traditional sushi rice is seasoned with a slight glaze and a very subtle sweetness.  Now, if Andy seasoned the sushi rice as sushi rice should be seasoned, then I'd have to give the guy at least a 4.5 star rating (fresh ingredients, ample servings, creativity, appearance or presentation and seasoned sushi rice on top of all of that). \nI think I'm going to have to defend Sushi a la Andy against the folks looking for 'traditional sushi' in a sit down sushi bar.  You ain't gonna find it here.  And if that's the limit on your sushi palate, then you're certainly coming to the wrong place!  For if you're looking for fast, fresh and ample, this is it.  The bonus:  Andy treats you with friendly hospitality and part of the Wholey's family. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This was the most horrible for I've had in YEARS! I'm pretty forgiving but I can't forgive the junk they cooked here. Please don't go, you will be horribly dissatisfied...I went at 12:30pm on a Friday. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I took a friend who was visiting from out of town to Saturday brunch and both of us were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is great and the food even better.  I had the Benedict and Enchiladas (Richardsons Combo) and was a bit surprised (in a good way) by the burn of chili peppers.  The smoked pork loin on the Benedict was also noticeable and overall it's probably been one of the best meals I've had in quite a while. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best of Philly in my opinion is hands down the Best Cheese Steak in the Valley.\n\nThey build sandwiches to your liking with fresh baked bread, lean steak grilled with olive oil and real American cheese. \n\nYes the place is small, however the owner has a giant heart. He and his wife have stayed true to form and their passion for cleanliness and quality shines through with every menu item.\n\nMy business partner and I have made the pilgrimage to Best of Philly in Phoenix every week from Tempe for six years running.\n\nBest of Philly experimented with a second location in Mesa; however, they sold that store off, so be sure to stick to the real deal and grab a coupon from the website. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Waited over 40 minutes for a half-pound of dry ground beef; nothing \""BBQ\"" about the BBQ Western burger. If the rest of the menu is the same quality, no wonder they need girls in shorts and tank tops to get customers! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was trying to decide whether to visit the Carnegie Museum of Art or the Museum of Natural History, and decided to go with the art museum first.  Lo and behold, your admission ticket to one gets you into the other at no charge, and they're connected so you don't even have to go outside.  Score!\n\nSo, two great museums for the price of one.  The art museum, even on a Saturday afternoon, was not crowded.  The galleries don't have the most intuitive layout, and I kept feeling like I was missing something as I walked through the smallish rooms.  Still, it was pretty easy to find the collections that most interested me.  The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history.\n\nThe natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons.  I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife.\n\nOverall, a worthwhile diversion on a larger scale than you'd expect in a city Pittsburgh's size, with a bonus museum in the price of your ticket. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bottom line, save your money and go to Mastros. I'm not a fan of capital grill but decided to give it a shot since I hadn't been there for ages.  Old country club decor, servers that can barely crack a smile, and the food is a poor value. The good dishes were the lobster crab cake appetizer which had large chunks of lobster and a fresh corn salsa, and the spinach salad.  Both of our steaks were ordered med rare and came out rare. We sent them back and the filet was ok but my kc strip was still rare in the center. The filet was very bland even though it was served with a pathetic portion of cippolini onions, mushrooms, and a sauce. The kc strip with roquefort cheese and crispy onions on top could have been amazing if cooked properly though it can't really hold a candle to Mastros. Dessert was unimpressive as well and really uninspired. Obviously left feeling disappointed and bewildered how this place stays in business with so many amazing restaurants around... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would never stay here again.  There was a party going on in the next room and nothing was done about the noise.  I complained again in the morning to the desk clerk and was basically sent on my way with a very insincere apology.  When I contacted Motel 6 I was told that the reason the hotel was so noisy was the Illinois Marathon.  I was one of the marathoners staying in the hotel and i can assure you that the noise going on in the hotel was not by the other runners, especially at 3:00 A.M. with a 7:30 A.M. start.  The problem was a bus of students who partied, went out and partied and then returned to party some more.\nThe room itself was very basic, which I expected and did not mind.  The floor sloped at various angles and did little to muffle noise.  Very thin walls increased the noise.  The bathroom was dingy <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I poped in for a quick lunch yesterday knowing they would probley have a buffet. they are'nt overly cheery to have you as a customer not that there rude there is no emotion at all....so i was told to take any table and off i went to the buffet you better be ready for chicken because thats the protien du jour one of the chicken dishes was quite tasty the other tandori was dry the spinich dish was good along w/the naan the food was not bad but when i paid it was 11$ a bit pricey....no...alot pricy for the selection of dishes.....maybe there dinners are better but i most likly wont return to find out <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Don't park your car and expect it to be there when you come out after eating there.  They towed my car today because I did not eat in the restaurant.  Unfortuantly we did eat there and could not get out of the parking lot because of event across the street.  So we walked around the nuthouse01area for a bit came back and car was gone. Talked to manager who said we did not eat there and I showed receipt and was told that was I was not seen on some camera so I did not eat there.  Now have to wait until Monday to get my car.  Well thats it never eat here again.  \n\nLost customer for ever Wendy'  Wish Dave were alive he would have treated customer much differently.\nShame on Wendy's <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We like to order from here for take out.  We usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan, Mongolian Chicken, and egg rolls.  They always get the order right.  It is nice to eat here too, there usually isn't a huge crowd for dinner (I'm not sure about lunch).  The decor isn't much to look at, but the food is very authentic and that is what I come here for. Very tasty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here last night to grab drinks with a friend and had a blast.  The place was pretty empty in the downstairs bar so the bartender was at our service.  I didn't catch his name, but he has a shaved head and makes the best drinks!  The gin gimlet was perfect, not too strong or too sweet.  The dirty Stoli martini was even better....oh how I love a good martini!  Then he took the reigns with our drinks after that.  My friend had a chocolate martini and then something that tasted like a raspberry creamsicle.  Both were sweet but delicious!  And I had a blueberry lemondrop and an appletini.  Don't judge me on the appletini!  I just wanted a green drink!  They were all good and we were in reverse happy hour so we got the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped scallops for $5 a plate.  They were huge bites for only $5 a piece and I loved the sauces that came with it.  I'm coming back for sure, but only if the bartender is there!  I love the drinks!  Put anything in a martini glass and I'm there! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food for a Taco Shop is Ok... I got 3 bean and cheese burritos for almost 16$ That's pretty dam pricey if u ask me. I didn't look at the price when ordering so shame on me , but when I got to the window and she took my $ I then asked how much burritos were she said 4.48$ each , shocked and stunned at the price still I didn't have time to do the math in my head , I get my food .. Confused , I pull over to see the menu and BEAN Burritos are 3.15$ cheese is .95 so that equals 4.10$ .. Where did she get 4.48$ ?? And how did it end up 16$ ?!?!  Long story short , BEAN and CHEESE burritos are not on the menu , cheese is a extra cost.  The burrito it's self isn't bad and isn't the best ... Bottom line - do the math before u order cause they don't . I will not be going there again , I can get way better 5$ bean and cheese somewhere else ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Outstanding place - a real asset for Pittsburgh.  They carry incredible food, but they don't carry the snobby attitudes (or high prices) that usually go along with good food.  Great cheese selection, and the guys at the counter know their stuff.  They're a little gruff, but they're actually really friendly guys.  (Please: don't hold a five minute conversation with them and try 10 cheeses on Saturday when there are 30 people waiting, though.)  The salamis across from the cheese counter are excellent, and this is probably the only place I've been that has 3-4 different brands of anchovy paste.  Their fresh pasta is excellent, too. \n\nOn the note of waiting: there's always a crowd here on Saturday, so grab your cheese number as soon as you get in the door, do the rest of your shopping, then head back to the cheese counter.  Better yet, go after around 3 on Saturday (or pretty much any other day of the week) to avoid the crowds.\n\n\n**P.S.  Don't go sampling 20 cheeses to make up your mind, but ask for a sample of any cheese before you buy it.  I just bought my second pound of \""past due\"" blue in a year.  (Two pounds out of probably 6-7 that I've bought in the past year.  And yes, I know most people would think that all blues are \""past due\"", but this stuff had the ammonia taste that's the telltale sign that the cheese has gone.)  Still love PennMac, but have a little caution. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Service -- not so much. :(\nFood - - we just stopped in for nachos, and they were super cheesy. \nMargarita - - 99c during happy hour 3pm-6pm. Meh! Tasted like a lot of sour mix, but what can you expect for 99c, right? \n\nThe nachos were $11.99, but then marked down $2 to $9.99 for happy hour. \n\nNeedless to say.. we've had better nachos. But really the lack of service will prevent us from coming back. \n\nWhat were we thinking? :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  There were 4 of us and I don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled, it was a slow weeknight as well.  So yes that could have just been bad luck with the waitress, but food is sub-par and atmosphere is well.\nI suppose this is a good dining option in some situations, but there are so many other places in the area, and I guess this was just nothing to write home about for me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking \""random\"" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same \""three\"" girls and then the host \""randomly\"" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After reading other reviews, I thought I would add my $0.02\nI am surprised for the most part that the Embassy Suite franchise would put their name on this property. \nThis is an old 'cool' place but it does not mean it does not have its charm.\nI felt like walking in the a Hollywood set of Melrose place / Karate kid establishment. It s definitely not for everyone but I enjoyed the different atmosphere this place had to offer.\nSure, it s in a sketchy part of town but since you re in Phoenix, you probably also rented a car so scooting to other nicer areas is not so much of an issue.\nOk - i did not pay for the stay either so I understand that some other reviews may not be as positive as mine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place. The chili fries are AMAZING! The best peanut butter shake I've ever had. Get it and you will not be disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Fish was good, atmosphere stunk, service was incredibly slow, and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis.\n\nAlthough my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty.  Then he completely forgot to let me order an entree.  Meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer.  The entree came pretty promptly thereafter though.  \n\nOverall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it. <|endoftext|>

They make your visit ridiculously amazing!!! I will be returning, most likely, at least once a week!! The vibe and atmosphere is just mind blowing. They keep it clean and sophisticated.  Never wait long for my drink order to appear in front of me. I was also waited on a young lady named Lexi. She was adorable and timely. Always a smile on her face! The service there is impeccable!! I was beyond impressed!! If you're ever looking for a great spot.. Sexy atmosphere, great cocktails, and unbelievable hospitality and service... Merc Bar is the place to be!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I tried to order to go from this place. The phone rang and rang and rang, when someone finally did pick up they put me on hold until the line disconnected. I called back and had the exact same thing happen. We figured they were just busy and decided to drive there to get to go. There was only ONE car in the parking lot. And the place looked like a total dump, like cockroaches in the kitchen dump. \n\nForget this place. There is no excuse for not taking a phone order when there is no one in your restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So I've been hearing this joint has one of the \""Best\"" burgers in town. I'm generally reluctant to order a bar burger - they are generally frozen and then cooked to well done. Not at Players - hand pattied in view of the customer. Meat is from the Jennifer Street Market - Right around the corner. \n\nYou want your burger rare - Fine... It's rare... Sha- Freaking- Zam! I think perhaps the only Burger Joint in town that is capable of cooking a burger properly to order. \n\nSandwiches come with pub chips - you can upgrade to fries for a buck... Other stuff like onion rings for $2.  The sides are frozen and then dropped in the fryer. But you are here for the burgers - they are fresh, as is everything on them. The tomato on my burger was actually tasty. My only complaint is the burgers could use a more robust bun... But the fact that Players can properly cook a burger makes this discretion forgivable.\n\nSo go to this locals joint blue collar bar - have a beer, get the drink special and order a freaking burger! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i usually get annoyed when i see people review a thai restaurant and give lower stars because neither the owners, nor customers, nor servers, nor anyone is thai. you've seen these reviews cause in my head, if the food and service are good, why should i give a shit who is serving it to me. the whole debate about authenticity is one i find annoying on several levels.\n\n. so, first, no, i am not giving them two stars cause the guy who served us was the blondest gringo (with passable though arrogant spanish) with a haircut i don't know the name for but would describe as a mini bowl cut/possibly a shelf cut. his service was SHITTY, which definitely has something to do with the low stars. and it certainly doesn't help that i had to listen to him ask the waiter in spanish, which he assumed i didnt speak, maybe 7 times if the cheesy convertible out front was ours but then i had to listen to him talk about convertibles with another table for ten minutes. that may have something to do with the star takeway.\n\ni actually could have heard the guitarist sing guantanemera 8 more times than listen to the waiter/possible owner talk about cars to the neighboring table. that is a big statement for me as my nipples usually invert for minimum 48 hours every time guantanemera is played anywhere within a 17 mile radius.\n\nthe most obvious reason for the 2 star rating is the food. it sucked shit. it did not taste that it was freshly cooked in any way. there was a film over teh meatball sauce that had to be broken several times for the moat of semi-warm liquid to emerge. everythin was severely underwhelming and lacked flavor.\nspecifically, these items, in addition to tiny meatballs in a bowl of lukewarm sauce (that the mother, bless her, was a fan of) would be...\n\nempanadita trio (we had the beef-BLAND)\n\nsome kind of black bean ball- the only reason this place didnt get one star is that the avocado dip for said BBball was tasty. this has to do with my undying love for the avocado rather than their particular dip\n\nspanish tortilla- the worst i think ive ever had, and i spent 5 years as a poor tortilla eater in spain and argentina in  between english teachin gigs when they came as free tapas.\n\nthe best thing here was probably the bread, they brought it warm.  our other favorite was some kind of cheese spinach thing that i would put more in the greek family. wasn't bad.\nall in all, this place was, mas o menos, mierda <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here, we were hungry shortly after. Go figure. Well, the service here on the times we have visited has never knocked our socks off. Just okay. Very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy. It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty. Not a place we want to run to on a regular, but good enough for a \""snack\"". <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went here on a Friday night, and like everyone else says, it is your average bowling alley.  However, I did not care for the customer service.  I called around 2pm to book two lanes for my husband and I, as we are practicing on bowling not just hanging out like most other people.  I was told that they booked us two lanes and when I showed up at 7pm, we only got one lane, which would normally be okay, but there were clearly lanes available.  Then, the people next to us were acting quite immature and not even bowling most of the time.  They were walking down the lane and lying down on the ground.  This was annoying especially because they received two lanes for three people and when I brought this up to the front desk, they didn't have anything to say, which I feel was plain rude.  In fact, when I brought this up to the front desk, they looked at me like I was stupid and then they saw for themselves that the people next to us were walking down the oiled lane!  I don't mind having one lane, but don't tell me that I am going to have two lanes and change it just because there are kids there the same age of the staff.  I will not be returning back to this location, I am going back to Union Hills Lanes, where the customer service is awesome! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Luci is awesome.  She took the time to explain to me exactly what she was doing and how it would affect my hair.  She recommended products that would help keep my locks looking amazing, but did not push for me to buy them there.  She is very knowledgeable and friendly and I was easily able to trust she was going to do my hair good.\nThis salon is beautiful.  It's very open and has a warm feeling to it.  The gal at the front desk was so sweet, so be nice to her.  This is a Bumble and Bumble salon; so if anything, just go in to get a conditioning treatment and styling\nA great salon in my favorite part of town!  Go see Luci! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A beautiful theater, no doubt.  It's absolutely stunning.\n\nSeating however?  ARghhh... Can only vouch for the first balcony tier.  These have got to be, by far, the most cramped seats I've ever encountered, Boston, MA and NYC included.  I get that they will be somewhat confining; but, seriously, I'm 5'5 and my legs were crushed against the seat in front of me.  The thought of crossing my legs at any point was merely a thought; it wasn't gonna happen -- no way.  \n\nSo, while renovating it never occurred to anyone to arrange seating with a wee bit of space?  I mean even airlines have more space (yeah, yeah, by only mere inches, but it counts).  \n\nOne plus was the ladies restrooms.  There are enough to accommodate and the line went surprisingly fast.  \n\nFour stars for the beauty; definitely not for the seats. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress. Table of 8, we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings.  Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \""pairing\"" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her \noff. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \"" he's busy dining with a client\"". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always been wanting to go to this place, so a friend dragged me in here on a night I didn't feel like being out...but this place made everything seem alright. \nThe staff was friendly but a little slow at the bar to say the least, I ordered a couple of Long Island Ice Tea's which made everything warm and fuzzy.\nMy date ordered a couple of appetizers, can't say I really care for deep fried pickles but the wings were delicious....but how can you fuck up wings.\nI would have to say that I would like to give this place another ty on the food end of things. But as far as Sports bars go, this place is pretty cool, TV's could be a little bit bigger but that is a matter of opinion.\nPlenty of stuff to do video games and pool to.\nOverall not a bad little joint. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  awful tasteless food, ordered chicken chow mein chicken like rubber, sweet and sour pour and chicken no vegtables or pineapple and cherries one little bag of noodles cost me 32 dollars for an awful meal for my family ,when called woman said they are getting plenty of complaints since they went under new MGR 2 years ago NO refund mgr doesnot even speak english, get a new chef or call Gordon Ramsay in :) This place needs help for now on I will use panda express. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. We went to men's warehouse thinking it would be an easy accessible place to rent tuxes for our small wedding party of 3 plus the groom. When we went in to inquire about rentals we were told that it was cheaper to buy which we thought was weird but we decided to trust the sales associate and buy which ended up costing over $200 per suit after alterations. When we bought my husbands suit, who was the groom we paid a deposit plus the fee to rent all shirts and ties. When our grooms party went in to pick up shirts and ties they were charged for something we had already paid for. The best-man was called to pick up his suit, saying all alterations were done, when in fact the pants weren't even started. The tailor job was awful and fit him horrible, I'm assuming since they had to rush the hemming. We requested all items to be transferred to one store, and of course none if it had been, leaving us scrambling around town trying to get things together. Awful customer service, no one knew anything when our party came in, tried to over charge us when we had our receipts. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Not worth the crappy service, crappy tailor job and definitely not worth the stress on your wedding day. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've lived at Alexander Place for almost two years.The location of the complex, the quiet, well-kept atmosphere and the friendly neighbors are great. It's also convenient to have a full-size washer and dryer provided in the unit. Though I love my apartment, I will most certainly not be renewing my lease.\n\nThe management staff of the complex continues to show themselves to be disorganized, non-communicative, and disinterested in helping out tenants. Any time that I have called or dropped by the management office with an issue or question, I'm told something different. On multiple occasions, maintenance issues have been dragged out for over a week, with a different excuse being given every day as to why nothing was done. It is clear that this management staff has no pride in their work, that they care nothing for providing service to the tenants to pay highly to live in these \""luxury\"" apartments. The \""upgrades\"" were slapped on so carelessly and cheaply to fixtures that are so sadly outdated, it's unbelievable to pay such high-end prices to receive such low-end service.\n\nThe attitude of the management staff appears to be an extension of the property management company, the Conor Group, itself. At one point when I faced an issue with an employee serious enough to warrant contacting them, I placed several calls over multiple days only to finally receive a response from someone in the Alexander Place office. No one from the Conor Group could be bothered to return a simple phone call.\n\nThe cherry on top of all of this is the mandatory $100 cable and Internet fee charged monthly. Yep, mandatory. That means anyone who doesn't even use a TV or computer is required to shell out an extra $100 for basic cable and the slowest Internet speed. Never have I heard of this being done elsewhere. When asked about it, the management office stated it has to do with a contract with Time Warner, that they can't even do anything about it. But why did they sign up for this contract in the first place?\n\nA quiet, well-situated apartment doesn't seem to be enough to make up for a staff that can't be bothered to provide reliable service to its tenants. I would not recommend Alexander Place Apartments to anyone, the price is just not worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Welcome to Restaurant Hell, courtesy of Kamakura. \n\nGoing there with girl. Ordering Bento box (me), one of those fancy soft shell crab sushi rolls (her). Minutes go by. Many. After almost an hour, talking to the waiter. \""We've got management problems\"" he says, like in a bad sitcom in which *we* the customers are supposed to feel sorry for *him*. More time passes by. Finally my lunch box comes in. Close to inedible. The Sarku chicken (cheap fast-food!) in Market Place Mall is many many degrees of magnitude better. How about the sushi we ask? \""Your order had a lot of complications (!). First they've burned your chicken then they've forgotten to put the crab in the sushi roll.\"" No kidding? Not, apparently.\n\nAfter ten minutes: sorry we have to go, we said, we'll get the sushi roll (a $15 one!) to go. The waiter kind of half-apologizes and says: \""I won't charge you for the sushi.\"" Probably we were way too polite, or didn't show anger or something, because when he brought the check the sushi was there included, with no explanation regarding the change of mind. We actually had to leave, I had an appointment. Friend eats sushi a little later.... there is no crab in it (15$ roll!), just the traces of the skin of the soft shell crab. (Yes, we know the delicacy that soft shell crab, properly prepared, can be.) All in all an incredibly bad experience, almost on a par with the other horror stories restaurants in Chambana - B Won and The Great Impasta.   \n\nThe name and reputation of Japan, for which I have the greatest respect, don't deserve this cruel bastardization! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food. All their food is canned process nonsense. It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline. Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has a decent menu, it's executed pretty well, and they (of course) make their own beers. Too bad it's often packed to the rafters with \""former frat boy turned middling banking executives who still listen to DMB on the side\"". I'm happy to eat there if I happen to be uptown and the crowd wants to... but I try to avoid it whenever I can. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent cheap, authentic Mexican. \n\nI have been coming here since 2003.  As a vegetarian I usually get the vegetarian burrito.  A great deal ($4-$5)! I also enjoy the potato and cheese burrito ordered off menu ($3). The chips, quacumole and cheese are made with quality ingredients and I never skip the amazing salsa bar. I decided to be adventurous recently and get the cheese enchilidas with rice and beans. The sauce was tasty but the rest fell short. I'll stick to the burrito.\n\nIt helps if you or your dining buddy speak basic spanish. The staff always enjoys my friend's spanglish when attempting to ensure \""no carne\"" is in our food.\n\nAs a 24 hour joint, I usually stop by in the wee hours.  However, I had lunch the other day with the same great quality! A relief to know my intoxication was not the sole reason for my love of the place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to come here a lot because it is convenient. Its overpriced as hell, and they have shit selection, but the previous owner (?) Steve was nice. They have a variety of stuff, but not a good selection of anything. Cider and wine selections are ridiculous and the staff doesnt know what they carry, so forget about the drive thru. Cant think of a reason to go back really. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Had a Breakfasts meeting last week & enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.  I imagine my cholesterol jumped, however it was delicious food.  Steak Omelet, I'm thinking imitation steak but no, also with 3 types of cheeses what could go wrong.  You would think that with that may types of cheeses it would be heavy but no just the right blend & amount cheese & steak.  Home Fries come with it and all I can say is I hope your hungry.  The portion is quite large.  I'm guessing about 1/3 of my plate was home fires.  Overall service was good and food good, price is average for a dinner type atmosphere.  Definitely will add them to my list of restaurants to revisit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We were ten minutes late for our reservation, but LaVecchia couldn't have been nicer about it! Sat us immediately at a great table, and we received adequate and unobtrusive attention throughout the meal. Mussels appetizer was simple and good, steak and salmon entrees were perfectly done. Water glasses sat empty a couple of times, but not enough to really spoil the experience. Overall, a nice evening out. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Minus one star for the amount of time it took. We got there just before the lunch rush, and it still took awhile. \n\nI sat out on the patio, so I can't comment on the interior, but I LOVED that they had misters outside. Nice touch, Oregano's.\n\nMenu was HUGE!! Pizza's, pasta's, sandwiches. I went with the midday rush, $2.99 for a slice of pizza, $0.79 for extra toppings. My \""slice\"" of pizza was actually two large slices. What a value! I loved the thin crust. I added the caesar salad for $2.29 - very good. Not fishy at all. \n\nTheir garlic bread was delicious as well. I wish we'd have tried the garlic CHEESE bread. \n\nOur server even offered me a refill to go. Nice touch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables, I agree with the other reviews here.  I think the \""Manager\"" only hires other smokers, and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking, instead of being prepared to serve customers.  \n\nI go there because sometimes it's convenient, b/c of the location, but last week they left their A/C broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.\n\nThen when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though?  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!  Hello, Allegheny County Health Department?....\n\nThen the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars.  I've seen this there before, but this time, I said to them: \""You know, this is a business, you shouldn't be here.\""  Well, the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother?) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: \""We asked da owner, we is allowed ta be here.\""\n\nWell, that coffee I spent $2 on?  That is the last money I will spend in that place.  Disgusting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great beef brisket. Fills you up! I thought the rest of the meal was pretty good.  You can mix and match here, and you get a large cornbread serving with your meal.  We also chose to get the dessert, which we barely had room with.  This is very similiar to a southern style BBQ serve yourself resteraunt.  It was tastey. <|endoftext|>

On the occasion they make a mistake they are quick to fix it and very nice about it. The entire staff deserves to be rewarded for always being outstanding. Thank you! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Definitely a fan of Radio Maria. It's always a safe bet for a great meal. I always have tapas but they have a full dinner menu as well. I recommend the hanger steak, plantains, and pork tacos. They also have charcuterie and cheese plate type tapas dishes that work very well as starters. The wine and beer selections are also substantially larger than the average restaurant. Anyone visiting Champaign or locals that have never been to Radio Maria should definitely give it a shot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I usually am the type that only writes positive reviews. I am not the vindictive type of person. I can tell you, with certainty, this place does good work. However, that is not their problem. Their business practices are awful. The owner conducted a bait and switch on me. I had them write down the prices of their services which included shoes and pants and then when I came to pick it up, prices went up. Even prices that had tags on them for a certain amount, the owner expressed to me that they are old prices and charged 5 extra dollars after the work was already done, which I know is BS. I was warned by a friend not to go there and to go to Brothers Tailors on the other side of Camelback. For one pair of shoes they charged double because it needed a little extra work, maybe five minutes extra that I could have fixed myself if I had the time.  It reminds me of shopping in the arab marketplace in the old city in Jerusalem. It is an absolute shame that an establishment with a mezzuzah on the door treats clients with such blatant disrespect. It really is my mistake for going back there, it is not the first time they have done this to me. Plus they charge extra if you want to use a card - which is against visa bylaws. I never write bad reviews, I think its bad karma, but be warned when you walk in this store, you will get ripped off. I am 2 for 2. First time shame on them, second time shame on me for going back. \n\nRIPOFF!!!!!!!!!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not great. Stale bread and the food was strongly over-flavored. I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another, and I said \""just a half glass\"" which I ask for all the time (and get). The reply from the waitress was \""we can't do that\"" and the same from the manager. CAN'T do that? Terrible attitude - more like WON'T do that. Well, I WON'T be going back <|endoftext|>

We were originally supposed to go to Oaxaca for Caribbean Night, but when we got there it was dead *crickets*.  Lots and lots of people here!  Being from NY, I'm used to a very diverse crowd in lounges/clubs so it was weird partying in a place with only one demographic... I love dance music so I dragged my friend over into that room, but we actually spent more time in the salsa/bachata room because it had great ambiance and was filled with so much energy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Having such a good reputation, I was a bit disappointed with my last trip.  My boyfriend and I have a VW that is often occupied by our amazing American Bulldog Cashmere.  There was a good buildup of his fur in the backseat so we decided to spend the money and get a full detail on the car.  Upon arrival, they told us that it would be ready at 3pm.  Then it was later changed to 4pm.  After arriving at 4pm, my BF waiting another hour for our car to be finished.  Upon completion, the employee said :\""You really need to get a different dog, because it took us so long because of all of the dog hair in the backseat.\""  \nIM SORRY THAT MY $150 WAS A BIT TIME CONSUMING FOR YOU TO FINISH THE JOB WE PAYED FOR.  I maybe would have understood if we would have purchased the lowest wash/clean or something, but we bought the most expensive...so if you really expect a car not to be a bit dirty, maybe you shouldn't work at a car wash?  I'm just saying, it was a bit insulting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Flying Saucer is the Taj Mahal of beer gardens. Each time I've visited, the beer selection seems to have grown or something has been added that wasn't previously available to the human race. \n\nThe walls are lined with plaques from local Pro Beer Drinkers. You can register your beer-capades and work your way up to earning your own plaque. Sounds like grounds for a great DYL, am I right?! \n\nI've enjoyed most every nook of this fountain-esque beer haven. Great outdoor seating, cozy inside seating and the bar is long and hospitable. Here's a tip: order the pretzel. Oh, man. I can't think of a better pairing of food/beer. Salty, warm, chewy, soft pretzel with melty, melty cheese. Throw in a tall German beer and it's like being 21 all over again. What a treat. \n\nThis is the premier establishment to grab a craft or import beer north of Uptown. Can be overrun with UNCC students and other beer fanatics. Sometimes difficult to find a table for large parties. Absolutely love this joint and always stop in for a quick brew if in the area! Cheers! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a small, franchise-owned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area. Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. \n\nThe pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store.\n\nOnce again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. \n\nIn general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Placed a order for delivery tonight, I had guest over. I ordered the specialty chicken pizza with the breaded chicken, order of street fries, passion bread, and ordered twenty four honey hot wings. All the food was cold- I live on the same street blocks away. The chicken on the pizza was very dry, passion bread was hard/cold. The Street fries were the worst, rubbery and stale. The twenty four wings I ordered, only came with 11 wings in the box. I was charged for twelve. My order came up to $50.61 and I tipped the driver $5.00\nI was fine with dominoes, but my guest wanted something of better quality. As hungry as we were, Now the food still sits cold on my kitchen counter- minus the eleven wings for my refund in the morning. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The place was busy as expected when there are events downtown. The server came over pretty quick and took our drink order, then delivered them promptly, that's where the good ended. Waited about 20 minutes for her to come back, finally flagged her down to take our order. The most pathetic looking chicken nacho came out first. It was missing the chicken, tomatoes, jalapenos, black olives, guac and had about 5 black beans on it, we sent it back. The new one came out still missing toppings and the chips were burnt. My wife had a wrap which she said was good, my buddy said his pizza was alright. My burger that I ordered medium came out raw, and our friends medium burger was well done. She ate hers I sent mine back. My new burger came 15 minutes later and was super greasy. We had to flag our server down to get the check, which she ended up getting wrong three times. We were there for 2 1/2 hours and received a small discount from the manager. I don't know if this is how it's normally run or if they were understaffed for some reason, but I'm hesitant to go there again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Somehow I thought the place was going to be fancier.  The way the concierge at the hotel spoke of it, it sounded like it was going to be expensive and busy.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see entrees that weren't too expensive and a very comfortable atmosphere!  It was a welcome warm spot on a cold November night!\n\nI had the Pasta 3-course meal and was thrilled! - cesaer salad, all-u-can-eat 3 types of pastas and any dessert off of the dessert menu!  I thoroughly enjoyed 2 of the 3 pastas and particularly liked the meat raviolis.  Very tasty!  While it was an all-u-can-eat offer, we really didn't have much more than small amounts of each, as all the portions were hearty and filling.\n\nThe wine list had a selection of $28 bottles that were not fantastic, but tasty for the price.  And the ambiance was enjoyable.  Our group of 8 had pretty good service, and definitely enjoyed our experience there.\n\nSide note:  Not an Italian dish, but the night we were there one of their specials was Hungarian Goolash, that was raved about by the 1 person at our table who ordered it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I feel compelled to write this after going to the VA Emergency Room and being taken care of literally less than two hours after I went to them with my situation. I went to the ER AFTER going to my assigned Emerald Clinic, and the effiency of the ER really highlighted how poorly the Emerald Clinic handled themselves, once again. This review honestly doesn't include the VA's ER department. I'm not sure if the intense nature of emergency medicine puts all the most skilled doctors, nurses, and staff in that department, whatever it is, they are miles ahead of the Emerald Clinic from when you first see the person at the front desk, to when you leave.\n\nAfter taking a job offer in another country, I was informed five days before leaving that I need a health examination done. I went into my assigned Emerald Clinic hoping that they could help me out. Now, I knew my situation was far from critical, but I was more than willing to wait as long as it took to get this health examination. I explained my situation to the lady at the front desk, and she told me, \""I'll do what I can.\"" After about thirty minutes I asked her my status, and she gave me a \""thumbs up\"" so I was pleased that I'd be seen. After waiting another hour, I was called in back and told, \""sorry, we aren't going to help you today. You need blood work for a physical, and it's too late to start doing that.\"" It was approximately 1:30pm. I mentioned the time, and said, \""we literally have hours left in the day, I can go do what you need me to do right now.\"" She just sort of shrugged at me. I asked if we can skip the bloodwork, and just do a quick check up (I didn't need bloodwork for the job). \""Nahh. We can't do a physical without bloodwork. And nobody else will,\"" (lie number 1). Her dismissal attitude, and apathy was shocking to me. What came next though really upset me. Another thing I was told was that, \""your health care provider is pregnant, and not staying til we close, she's leaving early, so even if you get the bloodwork, we still aren't going to help you.\"" Unprofessional. \n\nI asked her if she had any suggestions for me. She told me, very confidently, \""oh yeah, go to the hospital on 7th Ave, past Roosevelt, and they do physicals for vets for $20. They'll have you in and out quick too,\"" (lie number 2). After wasting my time and gas money driving to the hospital on 7th Ave, they looked at me like I was crazy, and said they do not, nor have they ever, done walk in physicals for only $20. The bottom line is that it was 1:30pm on a Friday when I was in the Emerald Clinic and they didn't want to take a walk-in patient after 12:00pm. So after refusing to help me, I assume the lady I saw lied to me to me to get me out of there quickly.\n\nThe person I saw at Patient Advocacy literally shrugged it off and said, \""It's Friday. They want to go home.\"" Like that is completely acceptable behavoir. Luckily, I got a little empathy at the ER, explained my situation to nurse Sharon (who was awesome), and like I said, I was in and out in less than 2 hours, WITH a health examination. I don't think Emerald Clinic's laziness is fair to the ER, who in my case, blatantly had to pick up the Emerald Clinic's slack. Making me wait almost a hour and half just to tell me they wouldn't help me was another upsetting fact. That's not how you treat people, and it's certainly not how you should treat vets in a veteran's hospital. Thank you very much though ER department, you guys do rock! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I use to shop here all the time when i lived close by. Its a smaller book store but you can find books at some of the best prices in town. I often have payed just one dollar for books by great authors. If you love books and like them cheap this is a place to check out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great little hidden local spot.  I arrived before my breakfast date and the server got my ready with coffee and the menu.  My coffee cup was never empty.  This is a huge plus in my breakfast world.  I ordered with breakfast sandwich with bacon substituted for the ham and hash browns extra crispy.  This was such a simple comfort food breakfast that I could have easily cooked for myself at home, but instead the staff here made it for me and it was even better.\nThis is truly a tiny little place with as many tables as possible pushed in there.  So if you don't like seeing what your neighbor is eating, you might try someplace else.  I personally loved making conversation about what they ordered for breakfast.\nLove 40th Street Cafe and can't wait to try it for lunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \""were already at the airport\"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The ambiance is cool and the wait staff are friendly....BUT....the menu is tired and the prices are expensive for the quality of food.  Great for a tourist...get you in there one time...but for a native like myself....there are too many great places in walking distance for them to compete with.  They really need to shake up the menu and audit their pricing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1/2 stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I brought my dog to Dr Arnold for a initial exam for a torn CCL and to ensure he was ready for surgery. During the visit, Dr. Arnold agreed that it was a torn CCL and then we discussed which surgery to do. We agreed on a surgery and set a date for 3 days after the initial exam. I dropped my dog off at the hospital for his surgery and received a phone call about an hour later from Dr. Arnold. Basically, my dog has an infection and he recommended waiting to do the surgery until the infection was gone. I agreed with him but then was shocked with a $400 vet bill when I picked him up. I felt cheated because I thought the infection should have been something discovered in the initial exam to say he was ready for his surgery. I felt like I should get refunded the money which was only $132 after I was going to spend $3500 total. There reasoning was that it was only a consultation so the doctor didn't really put his hands on him to check him out. My argument to that is that if it is the first time you have ever seen a dog wouldn't you want to check him out thoroughly to make sure there will not be any complications during the surgery. They did agree to refund $40 of the $132 that I felt that they owed me. I have total confidence in Dr Arnold but will not use their services again due to the way they conduct business. There are plenty of great vets around that due surgery. Try somebody else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Says it's Kosher, but apparently only sometimes.   I Googled \""kosher bakery phoenix\"" and Karsh's popped up. So I made the visit to the shop, preparing to find something suitable for passover. I arrived and was met at the door by the sign, \""Sorry. Our products are not suitable for passover. Everything is made with flour, bla bla bla\"" I'm paraphrasing. So I went inside, wondering if it was an April Fool's joke. Although the store was COMPLETELY empty, I mean, barren of all lifeforms, the surly girl behind the counter took her time asking if she could help me. Our exchange proved that it was no joke. They could not help me. No yummy kosher flourless chocolate cake would be in my immediate future. They were kosher - just not for Passover. Lovely. I should've Googled \""kosher bakery Scottsdale.\"" <|endoftext|>

Both times I have come I have had the My Sherry A'more it is grilled chicken, white onions, button mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach sauteed in a robust sherry sauce, with diced roma tomatoes, jasmine rice, and feta cheese wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla... YUMMY!  This is going to be one of my regular lunch places now.  Also they have a strawberry lemonade that I am sipping right now that is so refreshing! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Walked in and had to wait for the host to show up.  Got seated git drinks order, all fine no issues.  I ordered the Crab-topped Steak and my wife the Crab-stuffed Shrimp.  When the food arrived what I got was a steak that had a (frozen) crab cake placed on top and some sauce poured over it.  I ordered my steak medium and it arrived rare.  I promise you blood poured out when i cut it.  It was sent back and they made another this one arrived med-rare and I thought, screw it and said it was fine.  you could easily tell they had smashed the steak onto the grill with that flat iron thing, I do not know its name,  The one side of the steak was smooth.  My wife got shrimp that was rubbery and had a cut up crab cake placed on each shrimp.  Not worth our time and not worth our money.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe liked her sweet potato and my garlic Mashed potato was real good but.....\n\n\nthe manager came by and chatted with us and said we could come back and he would personally cook for me but I think I will not be going back.  We stopped going to this chain years ago because the quality of food had serious dropped.  we hoped that time had fixed this, but it had only made things worse. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Never go to this Jiffy Lube.  They tried to charge me $45 for an oil change- no way! I just asked them to change my headlight bulb, and it took an hour and a half.  They kept taking other peoples car who had come in after me, probably because they weren't making much money off of me.  It took them at least a half hour to actually change the bulb- I looked over and 4 people were under the hood trying to figure it out.  Clearly they have no idea what they are doing because last time I needed this service it was done in 5 minutes.  All of the employees were rude and had an attitude.  I would NEVER go back or recommend this place to anyone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> drive around a little before settling for the 12 dollar lots. we found one for 3 bucks only half a mile away...and we're going to register for a race, so why not walk a little bit. \nthey kept things moving and efficient, but when there are so many freebies to hand out, the flow of traffic does bottleneck in some spots (people will wait in line for 30 minutes just for a free water bottle, pen, or chap stick). no beer samples this year...boo hiss. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this place.  I used to live within walking distance and that was a treat!  Karaoke is a great time.  The drinks are great and inexpensive and there are always great people to meet there.\n\nI miss the pickles.  ;) <|endoftext|>

OK fine check the leg, but for God sake what is with this wiping the hands down and then the leg. I never see anyone else getting there hands wiped. If you do not find a bomb attached to the leg, leave the hands alone and lets just get on with it. \n\nReally gets tiring for a people who travel a lot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went here twice when I visited Phoenix in late May, early June, 2008. This place is awesome! The group I went with and I had quite an experience. Right after we ordered our food, we noticed some men with television equipment were setting up the table behind us: turns out they were filming Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations! Lo and behold, sitting alone at the bar was Mr. Bourdain himself, drinking  beer. We took a couple pictures with him, and spent the rest of our meal peeking over our shoulders at the filming of the episode. Alice Cooper showed up, it was a great interview! You can actually see me in the background throughout the segment, I'm wearing a tie dye tank top. The food here was awesome, if that's even worth mentioning. If ever I am back in Phoenix, this will most certainly be a stop for dinner or lunch. The staff is fun, with their Cooperesque eye makeup and fun personalities. I'll always remember my trips here, and I'm grateful for a great story to tell! (On another note, Alice Cooper is the shit! He's so nice, and funny enough it was my second time meeting him...first time was at my church in my hometown in IL. Believe it or not, it's true and I have the autograph to prove it!). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a good place to take your 90 yr. old friend. Please turn up the lights when you have the \"" Early Dinners\""  I'm sorry but four little pieces of bread for SEVEN dollars, really? then to get a special and it has a small piece of fish and about a Quarter cup of salad for $29! Don't get me wrong I'm truly not a cheapskate but in this economy to pay $145 for three dinners, then have to have a snack when you get home is terr able!!   Won't be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tucked away into an old central (and scary) neighbourhood, it was a bit hard  to find in the dark. Glad we did, though!\nGot a lemonade (made with fresh lemon juice), the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading, thick and juicy meat inside. The biscuit was really tasty and flaky. It came with a few cubes of watermelon but I don't like melon so those went untouched. \nWe sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly. They have quite a few regulars and I could see why. The prices were a bit higher than I expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity. \nAn order of cheddar bacon fries, a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side, lemonade, and tip totalled to just over $21. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome!! Can't believe i drove by it a million times and never went. Best ribs!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I didn't hate it, it was okay. If you have a lot of time to piss away, go ahead and check this out. The service is super slow. There was no one to greet my fianc\u00e9 and myself when we walked in.\n\nWhen someone did come out about 5 minutes later, she greeted the first party and invited them to sit where they liked, so we followed suit. Then she brought out water about 10-15 minutes or so later. The water was refreshing! They have freshly sliced oranges in it!\n\nThen about 10 minutes after that we ordered. If you're keeping track, we has been here about 25-30 mins at this point. We shared the dumplings, I had the sweet and sour divine, and he had the Garlic sensation.\n\nThe lentil soup they serve with the meal was yummy! And the dumplings can satisfy in insatiable appetite for all things dumpling. I have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings. Mmm, dumpling. \n\nThey serve Stash jasmine green tea, which I loved. The soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good, nonetheless. I could make a tastier meat sub, myself\n\nAnd holy hell, they do not know what a sense of urgency is! We had to leave and said, \""we're running late, can you go ahead and run our bill?\"" Note, we has already finished eating and had not even been visited for a check. She went off, did a couple of other things, adjusted a menu on her way to the register, and finally checked us out. \n\nIf you go, do not expect great service. Expect alright food, aloofness, and a strange ambiance. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would not eat there any more. I went there late night or lets say after 4am. The staff didn't know how to greet a customer the appropriate way and was dressed any kind of way. I seen a few staffs without there McShirts on. And i know McDonalds have uniforms. Then they messed up my order. And instead of making me a new one. I believe they swap out the bacon and put this dried up steak and dried up onions on the same egg, cheese and bagel. Because she said i would have to wait and then Bam! the sandwich was there. 15sec.  My other item bacon, egg, and cheese was also hard, dry and cold. After waiting in drive thru line at this time of morning, I was expecting 3 hot freshly made biscuits and bagel. Smh. terrible. They didnt even offer me anything for their mistake and wait. Looks like they were in there just playing with ppls food. My thing was, breakfast just started at 4am. It was 4:11am when i ordered. Why is the food hard and dry?\n\nI was so disgusted with the unprofessionalism, not caring employees, i didnt want to even look at them anymore and i didnt want to wait and make them cook it over because i was tired and hungry. I don't usually eat at Mcdonalds and you pretty much know what ur getting, but dam! That is just ridiculous. You had to see it with your own eyes.  \n\nAll i can say is the staff at this location needs to be trained much better including managers. There is no reason to run a business that way. I don't care what area its in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The worst service ever :( They messed up our food and we complained we go yield at. I will take my money some were else. There are plenty of Indian restaurants in the valley, and you just lost a customer :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is ridiculously expensive, but being from out of town and I'm trying to experience all there is to the east coast I was brought here by my colleague.  I bought sugar cookies for my kids that were $5 each and I expected it to be top notch for that price, but all it was was a regular sugar cookie, of regular size, and of regular taste.  I tried the mocha they had and it was just ok (the chocolate they used wasn't really that great) and the next day I decided to give it a try with a vanilla latte instead and again it was just ok.\n\nFor the price and quality of it's products I'd probably look somewhere else. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I came into this store on Saturday to upgrade our phones and to add him to my plan. We were put in the queue for a sales associate, and were then called over by a woman with blonde curly hair who basically refused to help us at all.\n\nHere's what happened:\nUnbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. \n\nMe -So how do I change my name on my account?  \n\nSale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?\n\nMe - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.\nSo how do I go about changing my name on my account?\n\nSales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.\n\nMe - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?\n\nSales associate - Not at the store level\n\nMe- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....\n\nI then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.\n\nThe woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?\n\nCongrats for earning my first 1 star review!\n\nIf you need to go to a Verizon store, drive the 6 miles to the other one on 44th and Thomas where they actually will help you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I dig the melting pot, i mean, its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  \""Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!\"" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement. \nI also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo...\nGoing with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Friend asked me if I wanted to go out and I said heck ya, he said what about downtown Phoenix tonight, I asked him what does he have in mind, he being a rock n roll kinda guy said Copperstown! My 1st thought,,ooohhh yummy getting BBQ!!!! Everyone from the valley knows Copperstown gets down on BBQ, regardless if you're a rock n rock fan or not.  So I said let's roll!! \n\nOne of the things that Copperstown boast is that it's a one-of-a-kind sports bar, when we walked in I 1st thought eh Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 feeling,,,the guitars  on the wall, other rock banks & Alice's memorabilia on the walls and a store for those would like to buy Copperstown related items (sounds like Hard Rock right?). So that one of the kind feeling was lost on me but he does also have sport related memorabilia hanging on the walls as well and I have to say I was digging the blue glass behind the bar.\n\n All the staff has the \""Alice Eyes\"" which I though was kinda cool, our waiter was very nice and friendly, when we got to Copperstown I checked in on Facebook and got 10% off our bill, which I thought was pretty cool too.  \n\nThe menu items are named after people, and I did catch a glance of the \""Big Unit\"" hot dog, yes it is 22 inches, if I was with  a bigger party I wouldn't mind trying it, it looks loaded with everything and its 18 bucks, but if you split that between 3 or 4, that's really not bad,,,unless you're the type that can eat the entire dog, Im a Man Vs Food fan and I know Adam had his turn with the Big Unit,,,but anyways back to my trip to Coopertowns.  \n\nSo after scanning the menu, I was ready to try one of the bbq sandwiches, because it said messy but good , and I'm all about a messy bbq. I ordered the Gonzo's BBQ Beef which is beef brisket that had been slow smoked all day then shredded & tossed with bbq sauce and the sides were the nightmare chili and fries. I noticed they had drink specials so I ordered a drink or 2 lol. \n\nWhen I ordered I asked the waiter if the chili was spicy hot, he said yes, because something called nightmare chili gotta hurt right?? And I'm a fan of heat, so bring it on! Well sorry to disappoint yall, it hot at all, and maybe the name nightmare is from one of Alice's song and not for the heat it could have had, it but it was very favorable with a smoky taste to it, I wasn't let down by the absence of heat because I did enjoy the chili, in fact I wish I had more of it. Ok now the fries, I wasn't too keen on the fries they were deep fried and like had been dipped in batter or something because it had little nuggets on them, but cover them in bbq sauce and it's all ok, but I'll try the slaw next time. \n\nThe sandwich which I had been yearning for since ordering it came and I removed the top bun and expected to see a saucy meat mess and was let down I saw shredded beef and little sauce,,,,how is this messy? But the beef tasted so dang good; I just asked the waiter for more bbq sauce and got messy! Over all my experience at Cooperstown was enjoyable, was watching the NBA playoffs on all the screens except 2 screens had the Diamondback game on, the staff was friendly and fun and that right their makes a place Great! I do plan on going back and getting some more BBQ 4sure! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's kinda my fault. I should have yelped this location first. But most Applebee's I've frequented have been decent.  The service was good. But the food wasn't up to par. My wife and I had their 2/$20 deal. Spinach & Artichoke appetizer was so-so. Not much flavor. My wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta. She says it was \""alright.\"" (I made the same thing at home last week and mine was better) I had the chicken and shrimp skillet. The shrimps were small and just warm. they were probably cooked ahead and spooned on top later. The chicken breast was overcooked and dry. Served with fried red potatoes and a mushroom and onion stirfry, I hesitated to send it back fearing retaliation (if you know what I mean) on a different meal.  Now I'm totally turned off by going to another Applebee's whereever I travel. Should have went to get burgers at Five Guys in the same parking lot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The post-party for the Switch OYE was here. Even if there were only 8 of us. We came just in time for trivia night. Which is apparently a big deal here. I LOVE trivia with useless factoids, so I felt right at home. 40 questions really tries the useless knowledge portion of the brain. Which in my case is most of it. Unfortunately I was already a little sauced and was 3 more beers deep by the time we were done. It was a great time, including war paint. We scored 28 out of 40. I am going back soon to redeem myself. Georgie S, are you down?  We also created a new game that works when Nikki F is there.  If she starts to fall asleep, someone says her name and then rest of the table, in unison, must yell her name again.  Good clean fun!\n\nI like the decor. There are authentic European football jerseys and scarves all over the place. Rugby too. \n\nA couple of side notes. 1 star deduction for, what I am guessing was a manager, coming over and telling us we were being too loud and disruptive. WTF?!!! We are in an English pub, with a lot of beer, drunk people, playing a competitive trivia game. Are you serious!? I was dumb founded and I think I may have talked back to this dude. Couldn't believe it. \n\nI have started my \""Slay the Dragon\"" card. Only 61 more beers to earn my shirt. Starting to train now. \n\nSorry for the pic post Nathan S, I had too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am a bit surprised at how many people refer to Ice House Tavern as a \""dive\"".  It is not a \""dive\"" in the true or hipster sense.  A \""dive\"" does not have 6 flat panel television sets, a disc jukebox stocked with local music & a modern internet connected jukebox, a mean pulled pork sandwich or a great selection of booze.  It may be old (by Phoenix standards) but it's no \""dive\"".\n\nIce House Tavern is one of the best bars I've been to.  Period.  Unique to boot.  It's attached to an ice rink.  While I was there a range from mites to juniors were practicing on the ice.  I was even treated to watching a Phoenix Roadrunners Zamboni resurface the ice between sessions.  As the practices died down the bar began to fill with hockey people.  It was amazing.  I was able to watch a Red Wings game with sound at a bar in Phoenix.  \n\nAccording to a calendar of events posted by the door there is also dart tournaments, local comedy and bands.  I think they get punk shows.  I found out, after the fact, that a few friends have attended shows there.  \n\nThe beer selection was most impressive.  Have your pick of cheap swill or tenderly crafted micro brews.  A delicious pulled pork sandwich is the only proper eats offered.  If pulled pork isn't your thing you'll have to settle for snacks: Corn Nuts, Slim Jim and various candies.  Great service too.\n\nIce House Tavern is a must and I look forward to future visits and, perhaps, the opportunity to explore events that happen here.  I know I have found a home to watch hockey games. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Being born and raised in Eastern North Carolina has made me really biased about eastern style barbecue, but I have to say that this is some of the worst eastern style barbecue that I've ever had.  I've been here a few times and on each of my three visits, i have to say that the BBQ really disappoints.  This is the first eastern style barbecue I've had that has nearly no seasoning.  During my last visit, I decided to pony up the extra money and just buy a bottle of their vinegar based sauce to season the meat with.  Even after all of that, it still wasn't very good.  I recommend that they use more salt, pepper and vinegar when cooking the hog.\n\nWith that being said about the terrible BBQ, the rest of the food is actually pretty decent.  I really like their fried chicken, coleslaw, potato salad and other dishes.  I haven't tried the chicken and dumplings yet, but my friends say it's really good.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and attentive and I really like the comical signs that they have outside.  I'd recommend this place for fried chicken and good sides, but I can't give the thumbs up to anyone regarding their eastern chopped barbecue. <|endoftext|>

So I went to this location and the girl who served me was Lorena. She greeted me as I walked in and was ready to serve me in 30secs. I had trouble ordering because what I wanted wasn't on the board. (Mesquite Shrimp tacos) I mentioned that I didn't see it and she told me it was no longer on the menu but she could still make it for me! She charged me accordingly and i had exactly what i came for in a matter of 5 minutes! Thanks to the friendly staff and quick service! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So, I know it's crazy that I'm giving this place one star but hear me out. I recently had my engagement pictures here. I was so so excited, bc I come here every year and I thought it was going to be an amazing experience. I have never been more wrong. I paid the $31 fee to have my pictures professionally done there, not a big deal bc I loved this place and it was worth that to me. I then found out we only had an hour to take them.  Ok still, we can hurry. As soon as we walked into the building, we were bombarded by the woman who runs the place(I assume), asking what we were doing, did we have a permit, and what not. We told her yes we paid, and we were waiting for our  photographer. She then asked me if I had any clothing changes planned, and I said yes, just one. Her answer astounded me. \""We don't allow people to change in our bathrooms, so you need to find someplace else, like your car\"". Ummmm, it was a Saturday at 3pm and almost 80 degrees outside, how can you tell me I need to change in my car??  I was floored, speechless. She then goes \""it's in the contract\"" bc she must have seen our jaws on the floor. How can you ask that of someone?!?  I work in customer service, and the way were treated that day was awful. Thank god a friend of mine who works with a limo service was there that day and I changed in the limo. My fianc\u00e9 did not bc he did not feel comfortable. When we came in, she followed us and goes \""10 minutes left\"". Um again, what?!  I would assume she's walked the grounds before, and it takes a while to get around, especially in heels.  We ended up going 10 minutes over.. Oops. And my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring. Apparently the woman tracked her down and said she needed to leave. I was so excited to take my engagement pics there, considering they will be the only ones I take, and this lady ruined it. I've never been treated so terribly. Especially in a public place like that. Part of me really never wants to go back there ever again. She needs a crash course on customer service. Bc she has zero. I would be fired and lose a lot of money if I treated people the way she does. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\n \n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\u00f6rhead tank top. I am a huge Mot\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\n \n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\n \n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I wasn't sure about going here. It came highly recommended but I read some reviews and they weren't great. I think the problem is that some people have unreasonable expectations, especially after having visited for myself. The food was pretty good, the portions were unusually large and the service was far above average. This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but nobody at my table had anything but positive to say about their menu choices. My daughter in particular had an adult-size meal that she ordered from the kids menu. I tried it. It was almost as good as my carnitas chimichanga. I hope that people wait til they are in a better mood before they write their reviews. When a place truly sucks then I could see, but this place doesn't. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really like this place! They know how to relate to kids. Always calling my daughter 'Princess' and speaking to her on her level. Like any dr's office, they can get behind from time-to-time so having the play area in the waiting room is really nice. The rooms themselves could probably use some updating but they are kid-friendly designs on the walls. \nWe've recently worked with Jennifer Valentine and she was amazing! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They are very good with gluten free, have a specialized menu.   Not so much for lactose intolerance.   Server did not know if any of the dishes contained butter, and did not offer to go check with the chef.  I ordered the flat iron steak, which came smothered in a spicy sauce. Had I known that, I would have asked for the sauce on the side.  Was stuck with french fries as the only certain lactose free option.  Would have preferred vegetables or roasted potatoes, but server did not know if eithe was prepared with butter.  My husband ordered the hickory grilled sirloin, which turned out to be a very odd cut and not particularly tender.   Server was very pleasant.  As this was my third trip to Harper's and none of the times was there options for lactose free, I will not be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i wish i had got his name, but they have an employee in there, white guy, shaved head, he was trying to be kinda smart with me and act like he was above me, kinda like he was competing, now i wore my tank top in there, i am 26 but i look like im 20 and im not trying to act tough, i never do. Anyway i tried to be nice at first, and when explaining my problems (there are about 5 different problems i am having with my brand new stratosphere 2) he would tell me \""well there's nothing we can do about that\"", and im like \""well what about all these other problems\"" he would reply \""what other problems\"" 2 TIMES after ive explained all my problems he says\""what other problems\"" i said f*** it dude you are an idiot im going to talk to someone else... so i talk to someone else here are the problems im having with the stratosphere 2 in my first two days (mind you i haven't really used my phone these two days because these problems are constant and f***ing annoying):\n1. i cant send or receive calls/texts (this happens on and off)\n2. if my text is somewhat long people either dont get it or they get a couple words out of the few sentences, just a couple f***ing words sometimes half of a word\n3. the calls that do go through, well 75% of the time no one can hear me, i can hear them, they cannot hear me\n4.the phone reads my sd card but it wont play my music (the sd card works fine in my stratosphere 1)\n5. i cant use my apps, they randomly just exit and im back to the front screen, if i try again it happens again\n\nOF COURSE when i go in to show them the phone starts acting normal, so i cant get a replacement on this f***ing phone that i cant even use, have to keep re trying my calls, miss texts, people dont get my texts or they get a couple words from it AND i cant use my apps, so pretty much nothing on this f***ing phone works, but i cant get a new one..... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Nice clean airport with lots of places to shop and lots of food options.  Terminal 4 is nice.\n\nTwo things:  \n\n1.  The marathon walk from the Southwest ticket counter to the D gates...good God, they need a tram or moving walkway.\n\n2.  The Security bag screening machines are old and tiny; my bag got stuck; it's NEVER been a problem at any other airport I've been through (SMF, LAS, SNA, ONT, SAN, BUR, SEA, LAX...)\n\nOh, and if you rent a car, be sure to allow extra time because the shuttle ride to/from the airport itself is at least 10 minutes.  But it's a nice rental car area... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What did I just eat?\n\nI'm not 100 percent sure.  I've been all over America and I've had sausage gravy over biscuits just about everywhere.  I've been down South and had amazing sausage gravy.  I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel 6 in Custer, South Dakota (no lie!).  I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.\n\nThe gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  \n\nThe biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin' Pillsbury, out-of-the-can, cook 'em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, I'll stay home and cook it myself.\n\nOn the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.  \n\nThe decor of the place looked straight out of 1985 and desperately needs some updating.  \n\nThe price would be reasonable--if they had given me decent food.  At the price I paid for what they gave me, I feel a tad overcharged.\n\nI'm not going back.  Madison is a big town.  You can do much, much better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \n\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \n\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\n\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here tonight at 10 pm, and the resteraunt was full of a bunch of panzy, animal like, horizon high school kids. Now I know that sounds mean, but they were literally standing up and yelling, throwing things, screaming across the reateraunt....and not being polite or respectful to other quests. The thing that bothered me the most is that I told multiple waiters to get a manager to ask them to act like humans, and that never happend!!! The food was good, and our waitress was sweet...but management needs some help, if they are allowing this behavior. I was informed by multiple employees that these kids come every Friday night so I would avoid this location!!! I Won't Come Back, I Don't Have Enough BOTTLES Of advil To Handle That, nor do I Have the patience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Last night was the first time I went to Soba and I LOVED it! My friends and I got some tables in the lounge area and it was the perfect setting for a quiet Saturday night catching up with friends.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Drama, Drama, and More Drama.\n\nThis review is for the event planning/wedding cake departments only.  I actually like the rest of the store.\n\nWe had previously arranged for an appointment to talk with the cake department, but when we arrived, we were told that the cake decorator had left for the day without plans to return.   We were then shuttled to talk with the event planning department about cake pricing options.   The event planner was cold, and odd, and definitely not in a good mood.  (For brevity and to protect her anonymity, I'll call her stormy.)\n\nStormy then gave us a wedding cake catalog with decorating ideas and pricing.  This is a bit of an overstatement, actually, since they make it intentionally difficult to figure out the price, hiding charges in five or six components and not being clear about any of them.\n\nI went to ask for help from stormy, but imagine my surprise when I found she was busy frantically scribbling a letter to Giant Eagle H.R. about how she absolutely can't get along with another person in her department and how they were always cold and frosty with each other and storming in and out of workplaces when they were around each other.  I didn't see the whole letter, but that was the gist of it.  As I was trying to ask a question, stormy excused herself and said she \""had to get something for us.\""   She took the hand written letter away and came back a good while later, having delivered her letter but not with anything to help us with our search.\n\nEventually, a replacement cake decorator came to our table with samples (good cake, by the way.)  The replacement decorator apologized for the \""drama in the department,\"" which I appreciated.  We asked her to help us decipher the pricing, and she gave us some quotes, but then stormy said those quotes were no good, and she would have to look them up in her book.  And then stormy herself became confused and couldn't figure out how much a particular cake would be, since they seem to have recently instituted a more expensive pricing structure.\n\nBetween the two employees, they weren't sure if filling was extra or not, and if it was extra, much it would cost.  Same with whether the cake structure could be modified, and if so, how much that would cost.  They weren't sure how many servings were in a particular cake, (which seems to have changed recently) and thus, how much it would actually cost.  \n\nBut the general gist is that the cakes are overpriced and about 40% more than local bakeries.   \n\nThe sad thing is that we really liked the cake there, and we would have liked to buy it from Giant Eagle.  But considering the ordering drama, we couldn't trust them to deliver a good wedding cake, so we ordered somewhere else. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to five bridal salons before finding my dress, and Anne Gregory was definitely the worst.\n\nI scheduled my appointment a week in advance, yet the salon still did not provide anyone to help me dress---and those dresses can be tricky. The owner, Greg, was assisting me but obviously did not help me physically get into or out of the dresses. \n\nI had gone to Anne Gregory's to try on a specific gown that the designer's website indicated was in stock. Greg said that he had ordered it but it had not arrived yet. Ok, fair enough. I asked about another dress from the same designer that I was interested in and was also supposed to be at the store, and though he went to check on it, he never said one way or the other whether they actually had it there. \n\nI was disappointed by all this but still wanted to look at the dresses they did have. Instead of pulling dresses similar to what I wanted (dropped waist, full skirt) he continually brought out trumpet and mermaid dresses that are just not my style at all. Its nice that he found them flattering on me, but i was clearly not interested.\n\nWhen I left, I expressed how I had had my eye on the particular dress from the designer and how it was basically my dream dress and I still very much wanted to try it on. They promised that they would give me a call when it got in.\n\nThey never did. I saw it in the shop's window weeks later, but never got a phone call. I ended up getting a very similar dress from a shop that actually paid attention to what I wanted and called me back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is fun to walk into, as it really looks like you're walking into a Depression era drugstore, not the 50's. It's crammed with old pharmacy stuff and signs, just lots to look at.\nI really wanted to love this place but I can't because the service just isn't what it should be. We were helped by two of the staff during our visit, one very friendly waitress who breezed by and said hello  and a waiter who couldn't have appeared more miserable.  \nI was surprised at how small and, hate to say it, dull, the menu is. Burgers, hot dogs and cold sandwiches. The burgers are from frozen patties and I actually had to pull a big chunk of cartilage out of my mouth. Yuck.\nThey use Thrifty brand ice cream and have an extensive menu of ice cream sodas made with unusual flavors. We ordered our sundaes and for some reason, they were made one at a time, so that my companion was halfway through with his before mine was delivered, and it was completely wrong. Wrong ice cream, wrong topping. But it took so long to get that I just ate it. I'm not going to complain too bitterly over ice cream. And I hope this place works out its kinks and does well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The worst service ever.\n\nI was staying in the Charlotte Marriott - where Savannah Red is located - for the Democratic Convention. I worked on events at both Conventions having come from Tampa where the Republicans held theirs. I'd been in the concierge lounge with a couple friends where I'd had 2 drinks. We made our way down to the restaurant and sat at the bar to grab something to eat before we set out on our evening. We were having a fun conversation and laughing and when we ordered,  I was told I was cut off from having more to drink. Not my two friends but just me. It was the most bizarre thing ever. Never, ever had that happen. I was not drunk or unruly and the waitress and the manager refused to listen to reason. I wouldn't go back here if it was the last place on earth to eat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This store makes me feel proud of Phoenix! \nPluses:\n* amazing button selection, at really affordable prices. You'll find authentic wood, glass, and metal buttons (but they'll be mixed in with plastic junk and odds n' ends that aren't even really buttons, just ... thingies). When I was going through a \""make Anthro-style necklaces out of metal things\"" phase, this was my No. 1 supplier.\n* cotton quilting fabrics. I'm not a quilter, but if I need a small swatch of novelty fabric to make, say, a Scrabble tile bag, this is the place I'll go.\n* fabric in general! I haven't quite figured out where SAS gets its inventory. I always assumed it was mill ends and dead stock. But I've bought yardages here that have clearly already been cut and clearly were originally sold by fabric.com (I recognize their inventory sticker). I don't know how the sausage is made, but oh well.\n* stuff you didn't know you needed. Yards and yards of that corny \""jeans\"" belting from the 70s? Holly Hobby eyelet trim? You're in luck.\n* really nice suiting materials. Mixed in with shit, of course, but that's SAS. Maybe it stands for \""Sublime Among Shitty.\""\nMinuses:\n* the staff, MAYBE. Though I have to say, people ask stupid questions like \""how many yards of fabric does it take to make a dress?\"" This is not the place to go with your newbie sewing questions. Take that nonsense to the cutting table at Joann's where, in my experience, the nosy ladies always want to get up in your beeswax while they're cutting your fabric (\""what are you making???\"") You do have to know how the place works: Get your fabric cut and then meet them at the front to pay for it. <|endoftext|>

The owner remembers my preferences, ALWAYS!   And remembers my name, as well as the names of other regulars.   Love this place!\nOne time a colleague was kind enough to get my lunch, but did not remember my preferences.  When my colleague mentioned my name, the owner told her how I like my sandwiches!\nThis is a very popular spot for fast breakfasts, good-value lunch specials, and ICE CREAM!  Love those mid-afternoon pick-me-up milk shakes.\nNot a coffee drinker, but this is a very popular coffee place, offering many different flavors.\nThe Mrs. recommends Halfpenny's.\n. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order, every time. We have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered, entrees to side dishes or deserts. Its all high quality food and super delicious. Whenever my husband and I get to treat ourselves we always choose Morton's, we love it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's ok. I've come here and been wowed by the sushi then other times I can't really say either way. \n\nToday we had the miso soup and it was ok. Edamame was good though messing that up would take some work. Our teriyaki chicken is delicious and the turkey salad as well. Waitress is nice and so is everyone else.\n\nI'll give it two stars due to average food and environment. \n\nBtw everyone swears by the Godzilla tails which are just super small strips of chicken in what I liken to a buffalo sauce. Ehhh cheap if you ask me. But hey they work.\n\nI'll end with its worth a try:) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is what I call a real dive bar. And truth be told I like to find a hole in the wall or dive bar to sometimes escape to. Yet I'm certain this one has probably seen better days. \n\nThe bartenders are nice folks, the regulars I met were pleasant people and even friendly. The well liquor is rather bad, so I guess that makes the happy hour prices fair $2.50 for well drinks & $2 for beer. \n\nThey serve food but I didn't try anything. Overheard they were having some cooler problems so I decided to pass. Most of what is on the menu will set you back about $8 bucks. But I saw that their burgers are hand formed not the frozen pressed blocks of beef so they might be as good as some people report.\n\nThey have really nice TVs and a few of them if you wish to watch something. \n\nBut even though I want to like the place for being a dive bar steps from Camelback Road and holding on, truth is I have been to better dive bars with better menus and well drinks. Hang in there Harvey's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hello!\n\nI work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). \n\nCompared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.\n\nI'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.\n\nOther notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I used to love Smokey Bones when I lived in Orlando.  It was someplace you could go to and just relax, unwind, and be yourself (other than my favorite, the Ale House).  Plus, the mountain cabin feeling inside made it seem more homey.  This one in the University area has that same look, but for some reason doesn't capture the same ambiance and provide me with that \""feeling.\""  I tried my favorite dish on their menu (the buffalo burger, made from real buffalo), but it didn't taste as good as the Orlando ones.  (Maybe they grow their buffaloes differently in Florida? Ha!)\n\nAnyway, I think the company's doing an overall of their restaurants, so don't count Smokey Bones out.  They have a lot of campfire favorites:  BBQ, ribs, burgers, smoked chicken, steaks, etc.  The ambiance is enjoyable with the cabin feel, and if you're never tried buffalo, you have to try the buffalo burger.  It's almost like a hamburger, but better in my opinion (and better for you!). <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was visiting Phoenix a few weeks ago and I visited this bookstore. Although they have a nice selection and the prices are fair, I had a disturbing incident with a man I assume was one of the owners. I was looking at a group of books on the shelves and there happened to be a desk nearby which I stayed away from.\nI continued looking and the man came running over to me and told me in a very harsh tone that the books in that area were not to be looked at. The area I was in just looked like a regular part of the store and there was nothing stating that the section was off limits. The man was so rude and so hysterical that it completely embarrassed me and made me feel like I was doing something terribly wrong. I told the man that he should rope off any areas he didn't want the customers to look at and he agreed. But I left feeling very angry and embarrassed and didn't purchase the books that I had intended to buy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Food was very good! Certainly not a creole expert, but felt very authentic.  Certainly beats any others Cajun places in Charlotte. \n\nService was friendly, was in a cute little Elizabeth house. \n\nOnly complaint was the seating was tight. Put four tables where three should have gone. \n\nOverall, I would go back and recommend it to a friend! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to Christos as my 2nd Restaurant Week stop. I sat at the bar and it was a bit crowded there, but with lots of good energy people.\n\nWhen I mentioned I would be skipping dessert, they were happy to sub a bruschetta for me! And I expected one, but they gave me four! And the goat cheese that came with it was fabulous.  The meal also came with a glass of wine, but as a non-wine drinker I passed on that.\n\nAfter that, my real appetizer came out. Eggplant with a romesco sauce, shrimp scampi and a stuffed mushroom. A perfect portion and really delicious.\n\nI finished with a chicken marsala roulade. This was just ok. The marsala flavor was a little too light, and the filling in the roulade was a bit stringy and didn't really boost the flavor like I expected it to.\n\nI would definitely recommend it but I would try a different main course item. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I felt decidedly underwhelmed and overcharged.\n\nThe chocolate cake was the only item that I consumed that lived up to the expectation or the quality implied by the pricing.  The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment.  I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead.  Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.\n\nTo complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \""sample menu\"" online.   To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Agree with Eric K.  This location is smaller, but cozier.\n\nI've never been in this location when there's a big crowd so I'm used to coming in ordering and having my caffeine fix given to me immediately.\n\nThe staff is friendly and there is a good amount of art displayed on the walls (I think it's one of the staff's friends that is a photographer), but the photos are always great to look at and are good conversation starters. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Hash was a smash for me. Also Tim the owner sang us a Dylan song. Great biscuits, also liked the potatoes. It is a must try if you are in Mad-town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So Pittsburgh! This is such a neighborhood gem! We took my grandmother here for her 82nd birthday and had such a good time. Nothing too fancy, just good 'ole Italian food, made in the kitchen right in front of you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This walgreens is the closest to my place and this review is based on their pharmacy.  It is the absolute worst place to go and I seriously recommend this place to no one ever. It started Wednesday when I drop my prescription off at 9 in the morning and they told me it would be ready by 11. I never heard of any place taking 2 hours to fill a prescription I wasn't in the mood to drive around looking for place to fill it quicker so I said Ok I'll be back. I ran some errands and at 12 noon I went to go get my prescription there was 5 cars waiting outside so I went inside and there was a line of 6 people.  Never had I seen a place so packed for prescriptions so I waited and as I get to the Counter and give my name they said it would be another hour or so. I explained I had to get to work and that I was told to pick up at 11 and it was 12 and the pharmacist named Frank said he would get on top of it and it would be 10 to 15 minutes well he was getting tugged around everywhere as pharmacists usually do but as soon as he got to my script he would type for literally 20 seconds before someone said something that called for a pharmacist to explain what medications were for and have you taken this before and blah..blah.. blah after 30 minutes he finally gets me my prescription and I vowed to never go back they didn't care and probably hoped I was serious being that they have no shortage of customers. That was Wednesday mind you and today my girlfriend took our son to urgent care and he needed medicine for his ear infection and also his rash I was at work but she told me that the same thing happened to her except they forgot to fill the rash creme and told her it would be another hour she was livid because they told her 2 hours and she actually waited 3 hours before she went back because she had to get my son down for a nap being that he was fussy and tired and the same thing happened and they didn't have the prescription ready. We will NEVER return to this walgreens. I will drive an extra few miles to cvs or any other place besides walgreens. I highly recommend no one goes here but if you don't take my word for it I guarantee you will be highly disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just attended a wedding here Saturday night and was totally impressed with the service given from all of the staff from the waitresses to the managers on duty.  They were accommodating, always attentive to the needs of our entire table (and group), making sure our glasses were kept full and were will 100% satisfied.\n\nThey kept the food area stocked with fresh food in the bufffet style line that was setup with great, tasty wings, potato skins and an array of other delectable morsels.  I even ordered some Teriyaki wings to go!  Hats off to them - great job - keep it up! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> When you love your clothes, you need to find a dry cleaner you trust. I can't tell you how many times I've had garments ruined - buttons go awry, seaming comes loose, hemming done unevenly. It's a sad, sad day when your dry cleaner screws up your favorite (insert item of clothing here). Thankfully, I trust Rosa and the crew at Eden Cleaners. They love my clothes almost as much as I do - and that's saying a LOT. \n\nI have thrown just about everything Rosa's way, including alterations, hemming, dry cleaning, pressing, etc. You may pay a bit more here, considering the convenience factor of Uptown. But they do a fabulous job and it's super easy to park in the garage, hop out and enter in \""650\"" on the key pad and someone will let you in through the back door. Easy peasy! *I've also heard that they deliver dry cleaning in the Uptown area but haven't used that service myself. *\n\nIn more than three years only two garments have come back less than perfect and Rosa offered to fix them free of charge both times. They are quick, professional and downright sunny every time I walk in. Oh, and she's remembered my name since 2007 and often asks if I've been working out more. Um, I love you Rosa.\n\nSo, bring your favorite garments over to Eden Cleaners, they will take great care of them...and you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Decided to try this place out on a Sunday night around 6:30. The restaurant was kind of busy but the two servers working should have been able to handle it. We stood at the host stand about 5 minutes before the cook told us to sit anywhere and handed us menus. \n\nIt took over 30 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. We put our order in because we were obviously ready( drinks, an appetizer, and entr\u00e9e's). The sever never came back while we were waiting for the food. However, all the food came out at a reasonable time for being down a cook (about 40 minutes). At this time we asked about our drink and the other server who brought the food said they were in process. \n\nHalf way through the food we finally got the drinks. So what about an hour and a half though the total time sitting down. \n\nNow the food. \n\nWe got the heaven rolls of something and they didn't have much flavor. It came with a peanut sauce and the tofu in the rolls were breaded in peanuts. So just too much peanuts not even other complimentary flavors. \n\nBoyfriend got the western burger with vegetables. The burger looked store bought and the sauce tasted store bought. The vegetables were steamed but did not have any flavor or seasoning on it at all. \n\nI got the steak and potatoes. Steak was store bought and the potatoes were simple like morning potatoes with peppers and onions. Anyone could make it. \n\nI've been a vegetarian for over six years and this is the worst place I have ever been. I literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review. Now that I actually have an account I will review more places. Usually I amforgiving when it comes to local places but I will never eat here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was, and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here, since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were, I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pretty darn good teriyaki bowls .. and at a cheap price !! Miso soup was 99 cents and pretty good with added soy sauce .. I will be back to try other items ...\n\n2$ happy hour chicken bowls 3-5 pm!! Cant beat that !!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why would a person want to go into a place where they virtually never get your order right.  How does an order for 2 large pomegranate smoothies with wheat grass blended in become half a banana with a side of wheat grass and a small pomegranate smoothie with a side of wheat grass?  What is worse when the fellow making the order argues with you that the order is right and you are wrong?  This is typical of the place.  A friend likes to go in there or they'd never see me again.  I make them read back what I order or they don't get my AMEX,   You can make then print out an itemized receipt.  I'd suggest it.   In all fairness, I can tell you they have gotten my order correct one and a half times.  That's not saying much is it.\n\nThe company could also spend a little money on some sound proofing this place.  I agree with Nadia C, with all the mixers going and the music, it's not some place you want to be for long.  But, they could spend the money to train their staff to learn how to ring orders properly, so making the place a little more quiet obviously is wishful thinking.\n\nThe parking leaves a lot to be desired now that the Verizon office is a few doors down from them.  You'd better be fast when there is an empty spot or it can really become ugly.\n\nThe best thing I can say for the place is they have good oatmeal.\n\nI have truly enjoyed writing this review!\n\nIf you really want a much better smoothie go to Robeks on the NE corner of 16th and Camelback,  It's cleaner, nicer set up, and they have a magic ability to get your order right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just witnessed a most sexist and unfair firing of a waitress in front of other customers. The owner was rude to other customers who tried to come to her aid. He said he lost a regular because she brought him the wrong tea. He lost a lot more regulars because of his public display of anger. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you know of a better donut joint, please let me in on it. This place simply can't be beat. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Despicable service at the bar, very selective about who they serve, and incredibly rude when you request service after they ignore you for 20 minutes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is hands-down the best Asian grocery I have visited in Pittsburgh. It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store, it is outrageously cheap--$1 for 3 pieces (3 pieces = about 1 & 1/2 blocks of packaged tofu) They have a great section of Asian-style noodles, snacks, and sauces, with the brand variety you will never get at a typical grocery store. They also have a really good selection of fresh produce that is hard to find in other stores.\n\nBe warned, the products do not always have English translations. This doesn't mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means you might make a few mistakes on the way. The store clerks are usually not very helpful because 1) this place runs on a very small staff and everyone is always busy, and 2) many of the employees don't speak English very well. The small staff is part of the reason this place is so cheap, so cut them a break. As for the language barrier--it's a traditional Asian grocery store, so yes, English is not their first language; don't be surprised. I don't consider these detriments because this store perfectly suits my needs. It is definitely not an introductory course in Asian cuisine, so don't expect anyone to hold your hand. But if you know what you are looking for, or if you are just feeling adventurous and willing to make a few mistakes, this place is worth a look. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went here on business trip for dinner. It was very good, fancy ritzy interior. The service is very helpful & friendly. The food is delicious. Everything was really fresh and made with care. \n\nHad the Salmone [Pistachio Crusted Salmon] and it was delicious. Cooked perfectly, great flavors. The fennel orange risotto was so good, unique taste. We also tried the sweet potato gnocchi. They were amazing. They were slightly crispy on the outside, sweet and savory. Also the white bean salad/dip that is put out with the bread is amazing. I would love to indulge by eating here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst Italian food I have ever eaten. Think Chef Boyardee at ten times the price. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This store is swarmed with staff. Are they helpful? Nope. They ignore you even as you struggle to get large, awkward pieces of lumber onto your cart. I passed 10 associates and not one of them greeted me or asked if I needed help finding anything even as I was making my way up and down the same building material aisle obviously looking for something. I had my lumber cart full, but I decided to not purchase anything and left it for those lazy idiots to put back on the shelves. No customer service whatsoever. From now on, I will drive three times the distance to go to Lowes. I worked at Home Depot as a teenager and I remember managers would chew our asses if we didn't greet every customer and asked if they needed assistance. I guess standards for hiring have gone way downhill. I wasted an hour of my day. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Loved coming here for a recent Yelp event!  I haven't been here in a few years.  It's definitely a museum for older kids, so my little ones won't be visiting here for a few years.\n\nI was able to finally visit Body Works.  What an interesting exhibit!!  I have only heard good things about it.  I, personally, had a bit of a reaction to it, but it was very interesting.  I just couldn't get over the fact that these bodies once were mothers and fathers or children.  It was particularly hard for me to see the babies and development of a fetus.  I'm glad I went, but I don't know if I would go again.  It was a bit sad for me to see.\n\nI think this is a good museum, but since I grew up in Chicago, I am used to bigger and better museums.  I wish we had more here, but it is a good place for older kids. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> How excited can you get about a car wash joint? Well, not very! Yet, this place does a good job for $8.99. They're pretty thorough, includes vacuuming, and it looked like they sprayed some waxey stuff on my Wifey's black, Honda CRV... Looks great! They have a lovely inventory of greeting cards as well. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> go there every other day, I love the food, not too expensive, and the ladies are awesome. always a smile on their faces. taste and attitude is what I rank this at. sucks that they close around 2:30 though. and a nice place to chill, they have tv and wifi. rather take them than most the places on Central, bunch of snobby people working in the business' on central so it's nice to find a spot that is inviting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Meh is right. My whole family is in love with Prantl's enough so that they convinced me to get my birthday cupcakes from there... First of all. They don't have cupcakes they have these little mini cakes that cost an arm and a leg, and are mostly fluffed up icing...bleh.\n\nThen, they aren't even that nice! My mom ordered the cakes, and I didn't know what name they were under... I understand that you have a line, but there is no reason to tell me i am wasting your time, when I am obviously buying something. MAYBE they could have know which order was mine by my telling them what was in it, but nope they needed the name. So I had to guess through a few before I got it BFD! \n\nRude, crowded, and most importantly not that great! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Unfortunately my apartment complex caught fire, and I was forced to stay here temporarily.  My daughter, I and two cats came here. I asked for a \""handicap\"" room, as my knee had gone out. While the neighborhood isn't the greatest, the train noise can be bothersome.  However, I loved the safety bars installed throughout the bathroom as I had troubles walking. \n\nOverall if I had to do it again, I'd stay at the Scottsdale location. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Brides,\nI spoke with Meghan at Lillian Lottie Couture in Scottsdale and she has offered to help brides locate their dress with a manufacturer and help out in any way possible!  Meghan put me at ease and was able to locate my dress with the manufacturer that I ordered from who confirmed that my dress is with them and is on hold - not to be shipped - until it is confirmed that the store is or is not closed.  Manfacturers will not be able to reassign the order or ship a dress to another retailer until that happens. \nLillian Lottie's # is 480.941.6041.  Highly recommended! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'd like to eat there again, because they had SO many choices, and I want to try their sushi. I got the ginger lunch, which was good, but not as good or flavorful as it could be. It was just kinda meh. But the service was fast, which was nice, and they did a good job of keeping up with refilling our glasses. I'd go again, and next time I might order something with either more spice or a different kind of cuisine all together. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would for sure give this place and their employees a negative rating.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  They are for sure people of Walmart.  In less than a month, they have cost us $200 dollars, but won't admit to it, no matter how far you go up the ladder.  None of these people know what the fuck they are doing.  My son now has no birthday present for his birthday tomorrow because these stupid condescending  assholes fucked up and they won't admit it.  No accountability for anything!!!!!!  Even though it was not our fault.  It was CLEARLY their fault.   But they are a bunch of fucking idiots that, combined, don't have an IQ of a wet noodle.  They talk to you like they haven't a clue and just keep repeating the same bullshit over and over.   Which to a logical person should make sense, but not them.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing!!!  One employee tells you one thing and next tells you something completely different.  In less than a month, I have closed out my accounts there.  I wouldn't wipe my ass with their ridiculous policies that they think they might know.   Except they don't know shit!!!!!!!!!!  DO FUCKING BANK HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BOTTOM LINE!!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Been here a few times over the last 5+ years but I must be getting older or the crowd has really changed.\n\nThe music was average, some Latin pop/dance stuff.\n\nIf I was exaggerating about this next comment than I would be a pig, but it's the truth, --- there was a LOT of very large women here, all in their shinny, way too short, way too tight clothes.  Again, sorry but it was the truth.\n\nHad a couple of drinks and left.  Didn't even go hang around the under 21 section downstairs.  Just kidding, I would never do that. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dear Pittsburgh, we are foodies from Boston.  The wonderful thing about living in a city like Boston is that there are few chain restaurants, but infinite amounts of local-owned restaurants with hip atmosphere and delicious food made with fresh ingredients and a whole lotta passion.  I understand you're hard up, but this place made your list of top 25 restaurants in the city?  Seriously?  The decor looked much like many homes in the suburbs outside your city-a little bit o' this and a little bit o' that, but that is beside the point.  Swarmy waiters you have to flag down for service (and by the way, the locals were having to do it too) is not charming or cool.  It's unacceptable.  Especially when a restaurant has the audacity to charge what this place was for a crappy meal.  And I'm telling you, other than the Thai corn chowder, this food was barely edible.  What with all the Kings and Eat-n-Parks you may not know this, but trust me, a visitor from the land of delicious, this is just gross.  And to pay anywhere over $100 for gross (or even anywhere edging up to $100) is just a slap in the face.  It's time for Pittsburgh to get standards that are above ground.  A restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top 25. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is so close to home and I love Einstein Bros Bagels, just not this one.  The place feels cramped and dirty.  Too bad because I would go here more often if those two things weren't an issue, I guess I could eat outside but I want the choice.  When we ate here the server got our order wrong twice once on the the receipt then when it was made; how does that happen? Oh well, maybe I will visit here again just to see if it improves or maybe I will just have to drive a little further. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Busy store. Slow service. They need more people working.\n\nYes they honored my warranty on my car battery. It took less than 5 minutes to find everything. But it took another 30 minutes to simply replace it because there weren't enough people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seriously Danny's. I just left, you washed my car just fine but why in the world can you not open the back hatch and vacuum!  This is the second time it's happened. Shame on me for going back. I will be calling management to complain as well. This is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave. \nI'd rather go to Francis and Sons on 7th St even though it takes twice as long. As least I know everything will be cleaned <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've always loved this place. Texas food is always good. I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. \n\nWe started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. \n\nMy son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. \n\nWe were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. \n\nSo the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drunk orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. \n\nSo good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here several times - some days it's packed and other days you'll only see a few regulars. The biker crowd seems to like this place and the sports fans of course. The owners are very nice and friendly and it seems they practically live at this place. \nThe drinks are priced good and they have some nice breakfast specials too. The pizza is really good as well. We ordered the super jumbo pizza for my husbands birthday and it barely fit in the trunk of my car - if you want the WOW factor at a party; order one of these. I posted a pic of my husband holding one of the monster pizza's so you have an idea of what to expect. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This happened a while ago (several months), but it still haunts me today.\n\nI ordered a portabello mushroom burger (I know, not really Irish, but don't judge). When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \""Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\"". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.\n\nNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no, instead, he stuck w/ his server, made an unhappy customer, and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place, so I will go back w/ her, only urging). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Triple A is a convenient name because they triple charged my credit card when the credit card machine wasn't working, which the drivers and other yelpers say is a really common problem. I disputed two of the three charges and they insist that there was no third payment. I'm looking at my account right now and, yup, there's the charge with no refund from a month ago. So they've had my money all this time and they're arguing with me because... ??? Stay away from Triple A unless you're ok with paying multiple times for one cab ride and/or enjoy spending A LOT of time disputing charges.\n\nThat cab driver was nice though. I took the cab home from the airport and we spent an extra 10 or so minutes trying to get the credit card machine to work which was frustrating at the end of a long day of travelling. The CC machine was looking like it wasn't working and was saying that the transaction didn't go through. So I don't blame the driver. But wow, if a business triple charges me and then fights me on whether I should get refunded for 2/3 charges, that is an enormous problem.\n\nUpdate: they ended up refunding the two extra charges. Phew! But save yourself the headache and only go with Triple A if you have cash. At the Phoenix Airport, I have just asked the cab coordinator to get me a different cab company if I didn't have cash and this has worked out just fine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Memorial Day weekend and you have only 4 agents working. It's the second year in a row that we have used budget rentals and we will never go through this agony again. Shame on us for thinking we wouldn't be waiting 45 min in line just to finally get to the counter to be helped. It's a joke have more agents working when you have a line of 20 customers on vacation. This is the last place I want to spend my afternoon while on vacation. Get it together budget. So disappointed. The employees are nice but the structure of being so understaffed is an absolute joke. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \""The Hangover\"" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \""The Hangover\"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.\n\nThe mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for \""Cha Shu Ramen\"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)\n\nThe salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some \""roadhouses.\"" \n\nMr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.\n\nIt's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.\n\nIf you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)\n\nI think it's too small for groups over six.\n\nMaybe we'll see you there.\n\nAdded 11/18/07\nI think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for \""Hakata Ramen.\"" For extra pork, ask for \""Cha-shu-men\"" or \""Cha-shu-ramen.\""\nEither way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  While driving home last night, we decided to drive up 7th St and look for a Mexican restaurant.   Sadly, we found Jordan's.  The outside looks very nice.  Once inside, it's obvious this place hasn't been updated since 1981- lots of dark, heavy wood & wrought iron. NICE! I loved it. REALLY!  I loved it enough to overlook the amazingly creepy carpeting figuring if they updated the carpeting, they'd have to update the rest of the decor, too.  We were blown-away, in a really, really bad way, when the chips & salsa came...as noted by others, it tastes like ketchup with some chili powder mixed in. Horrible. We already ordered drinks & didn't want to split and stiff our waitress so we ordered a cheese crisp.  The cheese crisp was fine.  Sadly, we didn't have any salsa to put on it.\n\nOther reviewers pointed out that aside from salsa, it was a good experience.  Whatever.  I suppose these same folks would be fine with a blind date who arrived in dirty clothing & who hadn't showered in a week.   If a Mexican restaurant can't do a decent salsa, they don't get a 2nd chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Upstream has gone downhill, fast. While the bar ambience and feel is still awesome, the sushi in particular was extremely lacking. Spicy Tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish. California rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland. \n\nService was also not particularly good and there was a very creepy manager who put us off. \n\nIt is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days. I cannot comment on the main courses as we did not have any. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The carpet is completely unsanitary and a breeding ground for MRSA. The instructor only verbally ran the class, never demonstrated one pose OR even made rounds to correct those doing them wrong. Lots of people that hadn't done yoga before because of the groupon and it's unfortunate they have been thought incorrectly. This instruction method is going to cause people injuries. FYI never do a jerking twisting motion with your upper body to try and square your hips!!! The instructor even told me and another girl NOT to drink water at the moment we did! So not OK, always listen to your bodies needs. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I asked if it had tomatoes. I said I was allergic to tomatoes. They said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich. Do I want tomatoes? I said no, please, no tomatoes. I get the sandwich, there are two tomatoes on there. So they put tomatoes on a sandwich that doesn't get tomatoes after we talked about how I can't have tomatoes. \n\nI'm hungry. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was in Phoenix for business and found this place based on yelp reviews.  I must say, this place is absolutely delicious!!  For starters, the service was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The chef's were extremely creative which led to my questions that the servers explained in completeness.  Lets get to the food... \n\nI came with 3 co-workers and all of our meals were delicious.  I had the pork ribs and they were fantastic.  I was able to substitute the sides for whatever I wanted without a problem.  Everything came out delicious!  The ribs were fall-off the bone, some of the best ribs I've had.  Extremely tender and not overwhelmed with sauce.  Highly recommend this establishment. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It is so hard to come up for a rating for this airport because as a air traveler, it is really not that bad.  They have been making an effort in the last few years to make the place more comfortable.  Adding wi-fi, some better restaurants, etc.  And security lines are pretty short considering the volume of people they have going thru there on any given day.\n\nIt is the outside of the airport that is a big problem.  Picking up and dropping off people is a nightmare.  The cell phone lots have made this a little easier but they are so hard to find.  The access roads for this place are like a freakin' maze and the signage is not helpful at all.  Once you do pick up your friend/family member, trying to get out of the place is so frustrating.  Even though I have driven to this airport at least 50 times, I always seem to have trouble finding my way back to I-10 and usually end up coming out the west exit instead of the east one where I want to be.  It is insanely frustrating.  If you are not picking up/dropping off then you are in even worse shape.  The rental car facilities and long term offsite parking options are fantastic but most people from out of town simply can't find them and even if you've been there before it is a real challenge.\n\nI know it would be a major overhaul to improve the airport access but at least improve your road signs, please! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I play in a league here every Tuesday, and I love it.  It gets me out off the house and I get to hang with my friends and play some pool and knock a few back.  The tables are good, the bar staff is friendly, but they do go through servers rather quickly.  As soon as a server knows your drink order they are gone :(  All in all I really like my Tuesday nights at Clicks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \n\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\n\n\n\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  \n\nServer was good, but my filet medallion was off . A second filet medallion was undercooked. By this time I was done with my ribs,which were very tasty, and my sides and I asked to see the manager. The manager gave an apology and only charged for the ribs. okay, but won't be going back soon . \n\nMy Strawberry Limeade,an alcoholic beverage, was great! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's past 10pm, we're hungry, coming home from a wedding party that served small portions of non-edible food. We're visitors from the West Coast, know nothing of the area. Yelped for an establishment that is open late, and still serves food within a 2-mile radius from our hotel. Voila! Yelp has sent us to Huddle. Not only did we get some bomb-ass fish and chips, we got stiff drinks for cheap. WOW! I wouldn't mind coming back here just to hang out if we're in town again. Only thing is it's cash only. Good thing we still had some handy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Food is great I can't say much for the service and the hostess who upon arriving welcomed us with a \""what!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow. Just was refused service because we had a large group. When we offered to break up and just sit with the family. Nope....not an option. Empty restaurant, and they would not let 18 people sit and eat. Their policy  is \"" no teams\"".  We had 6 high school girls and 12 parents.  The hostess politely  said they have had teams cause problems.  Well, this policy just cost them. None of these 12 parents will ever return. So I can't tell you how the food is. Just don't walk in as a large group. That is my tip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I work downtown and we have ordered dinner when we have worked late!!! Their apps are great and large enough to have as a meal! Love their hummas just the right amount of lemon Olive oil and garlic! Yum! Another favorite is the Asian salad. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I like going out but this place makes it hard to really want to come back.  Nothing in particular about the music or service or drinks.  It's just a worn out place.  I will say that the people watching in here is insane.  \n\nI do like the decor on the first floor, seems like a cool hangout and if I ever went back I'd probably just stay down there to soak it all in.  Upstairs is the dance floor and additional bar.  The floor was so sticky I don't see how anyone was really dancing.  I seriously thought I might be able to scale small buildings after being in there on that floor.\n\nPS. They don't even really serve breakfast.  They should think about it, then I might come back :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not \""Chinese food\"".\nJust same things fried in same sauce.\nWill never go unless Iam stuck in the mall and hungry <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The worst experience I had for car rental ever. I have been using Budget rental many years (at different locations) and never had any problem.  \n\nI went to them with my reservation and showed it to the representative (Dustin). He asked me if I want different car and my answer was no. But he gave me upgrade ($31/day) without any notice. (They seem to do this to many ppl if you read their review.) I had question with final charge but he said the discount will show later (I had a BCD code). It turns out that I was charged for a luxury car. When I complained, they treated me like a liar. I will never do business with someone who never honor their customers.\n\nBy the way, their manager even do not know that the time difference between Boston and Phoenix is 3 hours after Mar. 10th (daylight saving). He kept correcting me when we talked on the phone. I don't know who is the stupid guy. Maybe it was really me because I did business with them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> New pot found! Yay!! Tuesday Morning is always hit or miss -- you never know what you're gonna get, but I lucked out this time. I'd completely worn out my dutch oven-type pot with lid from overuse and needed a new one. I was able to get one here. \n\nThey have many knick knacks, things for the home, garden, car, pet, and travel. You never know what you'll find but it's always worth a trip here to see if you can snag a deal on something. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place.  I'm not much for the soda fountain offerings, but that's because I am always stuffed after I've eaten whatever I ordered.  I love the 'old' standbys...the egg salad sandwich and mushroom soup!  or the blt!   The wait staff is adorable.  And we get to do a little vintage shopping , too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went based on reviews. It does look divey on the outside but sometimes the best restaurants do. Walked in and wasnt greeted, shuffled around the dining room for awhile looking for a booth to sit in not covered in crumbs. A lady working in the dining room called for a waitress to come out to me. She brought chips and salsa and was nice enough. I asked for a water which came out shortly. I ordered a beer and said I needed another minute with the menu. I guess there was my mistake. At least 10 minutes later my beer and server had never materialized again.  There were only 2 other people in the restaurant. I left a dollar for the chips and salsa i ate while waiting for my waitress to return and walked out. I passed a couple employees behind the counter talking happily. Shame, the cordon bleu shrimp and smoked marlin quesadillas sounded really damn good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Purchased the living social for two oil changes and tire rotation. The first one went great- they did an overall inspection and told me about a few things on my car that would need some attention in the future (included on a written report). He did try to get me to get a couple additional services for an astronomical price, but I passed. \nToday, I went in for my appointment for my second oil change & tire rotation. I also opted to have my power steering fluid flushed as they had previously recommended- which cost $60. After 1 hour, they told me my car was ready-awesome! I didn't get the same 29 point inspection report that I had gotten last time- but that was ok with me since they seemed to be super busy and I pretty much just got a free oil change and tire rotation. Got in my car and checked the menu. They hadn't reset my oil percentage like they did last time (no big deal though) but my tire PSI values were all reading the same (I went in with one low tire and I was aware which one it was). I walked back in and asked the guy if my tires had been rotated. He grabbed my receipt and highlighted where it said \""Tire Rotation\"". I can read, thanks. I kindly told him that my tire pressures were the same as when I walked in and the low tire was in the same location. He said he would check with his technician. Comes back a minute later and asks for my keys. No, they did not rotate the tires even though it stated they did on my receipt. They said sorry, rotated the tires, but didn't even put any air in the one that was low. If they were too busy to do their job right, they should have rescheduled some appointments. My issue is that since they lied once, I really have no idea if they did the oil change & fluid flush correctly (or at all for that matter). It also wouldn't have been that big of an issue if the guy at the counter wasn't so cocky highlighting my receipt and instead check with his technician first. Just because I am a young female doesn't mean I am stupid and can be taken advantage of. I will NOT be returning to this location.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them two stars is because my first experience was somewhat pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ehhhh...not so much.\n\nWhile the building, level of service, and rooms were in line with a typical Holiday Inn, the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and Priority Club customer.\n\nBrief summary of my horror story - \nWe check in, we get the wrong room.  They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.\n\nWe get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.\n\nDespite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110 / night room.\n\nFurthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.\n\nWhen I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.\n\nThe next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.\n\nAfter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.\n\nUltimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  \n\nAlso, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.\n\nThat is all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Back in the day, my daughter loved to come here for the peanut butter shakes and a bite o' meat.\n\nYesterday, a chili cheese dog was a supermarket frank with canned, soupy chili and a tab for $7.85 (root beer in a styrofoam cup included).\n\nAtmosphere? None. Stuck-on mirror tiles with gold particles? Aplenty. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So we finally ate here. The decor has not been updated since about 1967, and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke. The food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare. \n\nThe waitresses were very friendly, and the prices were not bad. We were obviously not the target demographic, though. Won't be back. Too bad, because we can walk there... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It is so nice to stumble across a gem like this.   A darling restaurant in an cozy old house in Phoenix.   Art on the wall to enjoy and purchase if interested.    The food is fantastic.   My husband ordered the pork tacos.  There were four tacos on the plate and the meat was deliciously tender and the tacos came with a small side salad.  I ordered the caprese salad and this salad came with the best dressing ever.  I would love to have the recipe.  The menu said that it was lemon en-fused olive oil, basalmic reduction....best caprese salad ever.   For dessert we shared the coconut cream pie.   Oh my.....perfect crust and filling.  Heavenly meal.  Thank You.  If you live near by and haven't given the Coronado cafe a try you are missing out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm new to Phoenix and will not feel settled until I've found my go to cheap manicure/pedicure place.  Le Le was my first attempt and I would have been thrilled if this was it.  Unfortunately, no.\n\nI only got a pedicure and the service was quick, and the salon seemed clean and busy.  But the pedicurist accomplished almost nothing in terms of removing dried skin on my feet - maybe because I turned down the sea salt scrub for $5?  (Is it weird that I've never heard of that before?)  More disturbingly, the pedicure looked fine day of, but the next day I had major chips on two of toenails.  Not good. \n\nMy search continues. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Service was great, very attentive even if they were swamped. Maybe it's my fault because I ordered a burger that was too spicy for me to handle, but I expected a lot better. Will definitely visit again and get something that is easier to enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There were French fries on my sandwich!\nThis is my first time in PA, so I wasnt sure what to expect when we were sent to Market Square for \""the greatest sandwich in the world!\""\n\nThe prices were dead on - about 6$ for a sandwich and 1.5$ for a tea.  I split a ham and cheese with my friend and we both left full.  I had the cole slaw (which was more like sauerkraut) and it was yummy.\n\nI am docking them a star because the service was less than desirable, even after the lunch rush ended. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was whisked away to Phoenix with a few hours notice for work. I am from the SF bay area and have a wonderful brow waxer.  I have to book way in advance since we both have busy schedules and now that I moved I have to travel farther to see her. \n\nAnyways I couldn't make my much needed appt with my regular waxer so I've been scoping out eyebrows in phoenix and if I like their shape I would try to get recommendations. Well the front desk person had some really nice eyebrows and she recommended this place.  She said they were only good for eyebrows and don't ever go there for a pedicure. They charge too much according to her.  \n\nSo I go in to see Leah (the person that my hotel person recommended) and she takes me out back to this little room. The room looks very comfortable with butterflies on the mesh thing connected to the ceiling. It looks very clean. Leah excuses herself and says she's going to go wash her hands...I like cleanliness...however she returns in like 3 seconds. ummm did you use soap?\n\nSo anyways, I'm hoping this Leah person would work wonders but I'm not impressed. I could just be used to my regular waxer but when Leah waxes, I guess it's ok. When she would pluck some strays she didn't really get them. In a couple of days I had to pluck some hairs myself.  The shape wasn't all that either...and lemme tell you that my brows were really bushy. \n\nAll in all I wasn't too impressed. I only paid $10 so whatever...I just can't wait to see my regular waxer in the bay.  \n\nOh yeah, she kept pushing other things on me like \""make sure you ask to see me for your pedicure or your next brow wax\""...I don't like that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seafood gumbo - not very fresh, smelled of seafood, very murky\nOyster poboy - mediocre, dried French bread, few strands of shredded lettuce, pickles and tomatoes on the side\n\nService - we were the only ones there at about 4 p.m. The waitress appeared to be uninterested and vanished for awhile \n\nHmm. I heard a little bit of buzz about this place. I definitely won't be coming back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is easily the best deal for great Indian food in Charlotte. The food is maybe one notch below Copper (upscale Indian location in town) but the price is about three notches lower. They do an especially great job with the classic dishes, and they'll adjust the heat level to your liking, making it a safe place to take guests with little or no experience with Indian food. Staff is friendly and very attentive. This has become my go-to place in Charlotte for Indian food and I'm there more often than I'm comfortable admitting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What can I say about a place that was my home-away-from-home for about 3 months of last year? I kept coming back on business trips for a few reasons:\n\nThe location is terrific. At Thomas and Central you are walking distance to some of the best Thai, barbeque, burger, ice-cream, breakfast, steak and deli restaurants the valley has to offer. What's more important is that a light rail stop is right at the corner. Buy a day-pass and you can go downtown to the sports stadiums and concert halls, or even down to old-town Tempe, up to the George and Dragon, Hulu, Maizies, Doc's place or Chars has the Blues, or out to one of my favorite Vietnamese pho place on Apache Blvd.\n\nAdd to this the quality of the rooms, bedding, and furnishings. All are good enough to make me feel I was being coddled, and good enough to consistently impress.\n\nThe atrium design of the hotel combined with the breakfast buffet means that at about 6:30 to 7:00 each morning you are softly, sweetly awakened to the aroma of eggs and bacon. There is no sweeter feeling. It's like waking up in your mother's arms.\n\nThe bar has a cast of regulars who provide local color. They also have bartenders who remember what you had last time, even if you were there only once a month before.\n\nThe waitstaff is attentive (usually) though there were times at the breakfast buffet when I needed to get my own coffee. By the time that happened i was comfortable doing it myself.\n\nSo what are the cons? Parking costs about $12 per day in the nearby structure, and getting from there to the elevator can be a bit awkward.  There is also no place to lay out in the sun if that's what you like doing. \n\nOtherwise, I could easily consider buying one of the rooms and retiring there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Whole foods is one of my favorite places to go for a salad bar. Its always clean and fresh. The staff at the store are always really friendly and helpful. Its always clean and I love all the samples they have out. Some stuff is pretty pricey. but the produce and lunch meat are always about the same as other stores maybe a little bit more but you get organic stuff! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sundays should be filled with lazy brunches and napping. Instead I was greeted with a flat tire after a Saturday of bar shenanigans. (Seriously! How sucky is that?) I headed over to CostCo after AAA came to my rescue.   \n\nShort Story:\n+ Unbelievable customer service\n+ Car language provided in layman terms\n+ Affordable pricing, no hard sell\n+ Delightful personalities abound\n(Also, the $1.50 hotdogs with a soda are a killer deal. Plenty of living room furniture to sit on and kill time.)\n\nMeandering inside to the Tire Department I was greeted by a lovely chap. (I believe his name is Rene.)\n\nRene: [Sprinting across the floor] Have you been helped? Can I help?\nMe: [Still mentally sluggish] Uh...yes. My tire is ...\n\n[I stare around looking for a word.]\n\nMe: Flat. \n[It's not my fault I like Guinness.]\n\nRene: Ok! Let's go look. \n[Starts a walk so fast thru the parking lot I struggle to keep up.]\n\nRene examines my tire visually. As there is no visible signs of damage my tire is then misted with a soap spray. Still, nada. I head inside to start a work order. I meet Mari, cute as a button, who has more energy than a tween. [I suspect Marie was not out drinking Guinness like a champ six hours prior.]\n\nAs Mari enters my information my mind wanders to the cost of a new tire. Despondent over the fashion things that will be affected by this un-planned cost I inquire on tire pricing.\n\nMari did not laugh at me. \nNo, I don't know the kind of tires on my car.\nNo, I don't really know the year of my car.\nNo, I don't know if my Ford Escape is an xlt. (What the hell is that? This New York City girl bought a car. There are wheels on it. One of them was flat at an ungodly hour on a Sunday.)\n\nWell. Hang on. Mari did laugh, but *with* me.\nYes, I am a fool as to all things car.\n\nApproximately two hours later Mari rang me and I headed back. First Mari, then Rene, explained the steps taken to test my tire. In English. Not a damn thing wrong with it. Highly probable a rapscallion LET THE AIR OUT on purpose. (Thanks to whomever for that.) Just in case, Rene replaced the air valve stem.\n\nTen minutes later my tire is plopped back onto my car. My car has been vacuumed (!) and I was free to go.\n\nHere's the crazy thing:\nCostCo didn't charge me a penny. I sucked up their time and energy. My Dad had sent me there saying \""they're good\"". I had no idea. (Pfft! Tires? Aren't they all the same?) \n\nAfter yesterday I know where I'll be shopping for tires when it is time. Customer Service goes an amazing way. Thank you CostCo! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> To die for bruschetta.... savory and sweet, like you're having appetizer/entree with dessert. I love tomato jam & sheep cheese, ricotta with dates and pistachios, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone and smoked salmon. I just wanna try them all next time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pretty bummed. My dog has been using petsmart for everything.  We use Banfield.  She's loved doggy daycare. She occasionally needs a professional bath and nails trimmed. I picked her up last night she was still wet! Luckily it's hot out. She has matts in her hair! Her nails are not trimmed. I asked she said she did them. Not at all. What a waste! I now need to find a new groomer in fear this happens again.  I think she was in a rush! Regardless I paid full price and not sure what I paid for! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Enjoyed being at the Bank of America Stadium but the usher in our section was a complete and total Ahole. We were sitting in section 513 in row 1A. As my buddy was walking up the steps, one of the teams ran a play, so my buddy stopped at the top of the steps so he wasn't blocking the vision of people in the seats as he went by. The Usher started screaming at him to sit down! No joke, not polite, or friendly just rude and a jerk. Then after my buddy sat down, the usher came over and started arguing with us. Really? I was completely floored by this guys behavior. Are theses the type of people you hire t be ambassadors to Charlotte? You might want to look a little longer for employees, or not hire toothless high school dropouts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My favorite pizza in town! I love the thin crust. Sweet sauce, thin crunchy crust, gooey cheese. Great combination of flavors. Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I tried the spaghetti calzone: so many carbs, so delicious. And for good measure, they make some really good chocolate chip cookies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Definately worth the drive! New favorite Chinese restaurant! A hidden gem.\nflavors are great and food is abundent and soooo reasonable for that family of 4 to go out and enjoy. a meal out. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child, and it only gets better! Carolina's is definitely not known for the 5 star accommodations it provides. Rather people come here again and again, simply because it is INCREDIBLE food. The tortillas especially are to die for. One of the best tortillas I have ever had (La Purisima has good ones as well).  I ahve never had a bad meal at Carolinas! The prices don;t hurt your wallet either! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you're gonna be one of the ERTOS, at least be consistent.\n\nWhether its a Robertos, Roybertos or Bertoberto- one thing I like is that they all kinda taste the same and I can go to any and expect the same thing. I didn't get that at Rolbertos.\n\nI ordered the carne asada burrito and super nachos. The burrito tortilla was dry and had a flour-y residue on it. While it was a good sized burrito, the what seemed like day old guacamole just ruined it for me.\n\nOn to the super nachos. When I opened the box, the yellow melted cheese atop the mound of meat was just begging to be devoured. I couldn't make it wait so I dove it. Bad idea. Where are all the chips?!?!\n\nIt was buried underneath all the toppings and I couldn't grab anything. So I said... FORK IT! The chips were soggy and no crunch to any of them at all. For the first time, there were more meat and toppings on this than chips. \n\nNow we all know that despite which 24 hr taco shop you go to, the proof is in the hot sauce. And... a hit.. and it was just okay. I've had better and it could be spicier. \n\nThis does not live up the ERTO legacy at all. My $11 could have been better spent at Taco Bell tonight. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You'll love this deli! The sandwiches are enormous and full of delicious meats. They're known for their fish, but we didn't have that. The kids had big grilled cheese sandwiches. You MUST get the horseradish cheddar spread - you'll breathe better for days!! Their hours are kinda funky, so check before you head over. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BUYER BE WARE!!!!!  I've never felt compelled to write a negative review until I did business with this store.  I went to investigate purchasing clip-in bangs before committing to cuting my own hair.  The salesperson help me to find the right color and even showed me how to clip them in.  I told her I would have to take them to my stylist to see if they could be trimmed and styled to fit my present hairstyle.  I even purchased real-hair at the cost of $230.  I checked out and brought them to my stylist to see if they would work.  My stylist said that because of the way the hair was sown she could not make them look they way I wanted.  I went to return them and was told  \""all sales final/no exchangesl\"".  I said I wasn't told that at time of purchase whereby the clerk immediately pointed to the very tiny print at the bottom of my tiny electronic receipt.  I said that should have been told to me at the time of purchase and please could I exchange them for something else in the store... this is alot of money.  She went behind a screen and came back and said the manager said no to the return and no  to the exchange.  I said the manager may be technically correct but her practices are deceptive and less than forthcoming.  This could have been a win-win, but she chose to say the hell with her customer.  I was mad enough that I considered printing a sign and sitting in front of her store - she's lucky the weather is too hot right now. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is the absolute worst. I would much rather go to best buy or use amazon. Every time I go in their I either don't get helped or the staff scoffs at me and act like I don't know what I am doing. I may be young but that doesn't mean I don't know how to use a camera or that I don't know when I'm being ripped off. Stay away from this store. I really wanted to support a local camera shop but they make it impossible for me to do so. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Will never order again.  Supposedly we got chicken chow mein, but I can't confirm it was actually chicken.  We also got beef with broccoli.  Broccoli seemed safe, but not sure what they grey meat was that came with it.  Never will order again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have to agree with all the other yelpers, this is a GREAT burger. After reading all the great  yelp reviews,  I took my family, including my out of town mom, for lunch on a Saturday and was not disappointed. I knew from the smell outside of the building that it was gonna be fantastic eats. We were happy with the service also. We had a party of six and did not have to wait. We will go back again and again and again... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible airport for a layover. Walking from E40 something over to B6 should not be do laborious and definitely would be hard to do successfully with any shorter of a layover or if my other flight had not landed a smidge early. Not to mention half the moving walkways were not working. Will be avoiding layovers here in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came in needing only a tension screw for my bobbin case, and $40 later... $20-30 just to have my \""tension checked\"" when all I needed was a $2 screw. Didn't need my tension checked... It was perfectly fine until I lost the screw! Doubt I'll be back anytime soon, shame since it's so close. I hate to be so harsh but I feel pretty cheated. Bonus star since the repair guy interrupted his lunch to work on my machine, but a warm bedside manner seems hard to come by here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> There is not a bad seat in this house for a football game.  Seriously!  We had our backs against the wall in the \""nosebleeds\"" to see the Panthers vs Saints December 2013, and had a GREAT time with a wonderful view!  If you think it might rain, bring a poncho; if you think it'll be cold, bring a coat!  Employ common sense, and you'll have a blast!\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... the concession workers STINK on an alarming level.  By and large it takes almost a HALF HOUR to get a drink of ANY sort.  I stood in line for 20 minutes (ALL OF HALFTIME AND THEN SOME) for a diet pepsi... the workers are worse than slow... actually, city workers could give them some tips on efficiency... it's THAT bad if you're not in club-level seating.  My advice?  Eat before you arrive, arrive early, order your drinks, get cozy in your seats, and enjoy the game! :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Well everyone here is gai for Carolina's, so am I and I am thrilled that they opened a 2nd restaurant in my neck of the woods (Cave Creek and Cactus) because I don't go down by the airport that much.\n\nAs others have stated, however, the original location has a lot of, shall we say, local color. A little too much for me. I felt like I was eating at a prison cafeteria; hell, a prison cafeteria probably has more ambience and is cleaner.\n\nOn the few occasions I find myself going that way, I do take-out. I regularly buy tortillas by the dozen from them, they beat the hell out of supermarket-bought tortillas. The Cave Creek/Cactus location is a lot cleaner and in a much safer part of town, I have no problem eating in at that location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There is nothing here, not the food, not the service, not the \""ambiance\"", that's worth the inexplicable and inexcusable wait for food to be delivered when the place is half empty to begin with.  I'm done. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Time has not been kind to Flavors of India.  I just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place.  It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.\n\nPerhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with \""free\"" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.       \n\nFarewell, Flavors of India, farewell! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is the kind of pizza where the toppings are added after the crust is cooked. Cheese included. It's a novelty, and for some folks it's their favorite pizza. The taste is good, if a little weird, but for me, it didn't satisfy my pizza craving.\n\nThis location was crowded and the wait was long, but the people were nice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ate here yesterday for the first time.  Definitely a fan of the vibe - we sat up on the roof patio and it was like a garden oasis in the middle of the Baum/Center eyesore.  The decor managed to almost completely block out the view of Ritters and the UPMC parking lot next door - a major plus.  The inside was, as others have already commented, very pastel and outdated, reminding me of my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  Definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion, but then again there were quite a few old ladies there, so maybe they just know their crowd.  \n\nI'll cut to the chase: the food was GREAT.  For not super expensive, there were large quantities, many options, a very helpful waitress who helped us make some very difficult choices, and a clear willingness to tailor anything on the menu to suit our needs.  \n\nOne last thing about the service, which is what earns Cafe Sam its 5th star -- we were running late to see a play after dinner, which was our own poor planning.  But as soon as we alerted the waitress to the situation, she bent over backwards to get us our food as quickly as possible, take-out containers so we could finish on the road, and the check paid without delay.  It was definitely above and beyond the call of duty, and we wouldn't have made it on time without her help.\n\nGreat food, great service, weird but nice decor.  I'll definitely be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We have to fly through this airport every time we visit my family who live in South Carolina. I am not a fan. \n\nFirst of all, no matter what time if year, this airport is always freezing. There is a large glass atrium which is kind of like a hub for all the terminals. The atrium is pretty with several places to grab a bite to eat including Chilis, Carolina Pit BBQ, Cinnabun, Tequileria, etc. The Atrium would be a cool place to sit and grab a bite while watching airplanes take off and land but the temperatures are always arctic! I would guess this maybe has something to do with all the glass but no clue. \n\nThis airport is not family friendly. There is nothing like the convenience of a Family Bathroom when you are traveling with an infant. While this airport has several Family Bathrooms, they are always locked and never available for use. Because of this, I am forced to change her in the crowded restroom while my stroller, diaper bag, body, etc block the traffic flow of people trying to get in and out. This is so frustrating!\n\nEvery other time I fly out of this airport, there is some kind of problem with our tickets or some crazy delay. I think I've spent more time sitting in a delayed plane on the Charlotte Tarmac than I have in the actual airport (probably not but it sure feels like it and being delayed with an infant is not fun!) \n\nI'd say avoid it if you can, but you probably can't so, in that case, just be sure to bring socks and a sweater! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Being an outsider to Pittsburgh, I wasn't expecting much before we walked into Harris Grill. As soon as we entered, it was clear that this place had a lot more ambiance. \n\nThe Pro's:\n- The menu is funny.\n- There are a fair number of vegetarian options which are clearly labeled\n- The onion rings are amazing.\n- The portions are large, you can get more than you fill for a good price\n- They have root beer floats!\n- Our server was hilarious, you know that self-deprecating kind of humor\n\nThe Con's:\n- There were a lot of items that had run out\n- The service was a bit slow...it took forever for that root beer float to come out.\n\nOverall, I'd come back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this chain.  The staff is impeccably trained.  They make you feel like you're a long lost relative.  They even had thin cotton blankets on the bed instead of those oppressively hot duvets.\n\nNice business center, breakfast in the restaurant was nice, valet service was quick.\n\nSo why not five stars?  RC ran afoul of two of my criteria for five star hotel rooms:\n\n1.  The bathroom was beautifully designed, but can't the designers put more lights over the sink so it's easier to shave?  Why don't they figure half the guests in their hotel shave in the morning?\n\n2.  The chair at the desk was a fugitive from a dinner table, not a desk chair.  It was too low and did not adjust.  I had to sit on a pillow while I worked at the desk. You'd think the name \""desk\"" would alert hotel interior designers to the need for a \""desk\"" chair. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Desert Botanical Garden exceeded my expectations and any pre-existing thought about the desert and it's plants. Plus, I have never seen that much cacti in my entire life!\n\nSaw a small brochure about this place at my hotel and spur of the moment decided to make a drive out here with my mom first thing in the morning (please go in the morning, the heat is bearable). Tickets were decently priced and I got the student price, which was great!\n\nThe garden covers cacti, shrubbery and flowers native to Arizona, Mexico and California as well as Chihuly in the Garden. From a reserved spots that butterflys and bees gravitate to, to life of Tohono O'odham in the Sonoran desert this garden is quite informational.\n\nEach section of the garden was creatively set up, easy to learn from and paths big enough for people to walk through with little crowding. You get to witness various wildlife, from birds, rodents and lizards and is flat out a great experience. You automatically feel transported into a different world, so major props to the Desert Botanical Gardens and all who contribute to provide a place to showcase it all.\n\nThere is a restaurant, vending machines, Chihuly exhibit and gift shop you can visit after your walk around. Take advantage of shaded areas, wear comfortable shoes, put on your shades, take frequent breaks and drink lots of water! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My order of spinach and artichoke dip with chips at Cooperstown:\n\n--Amount of dip: George Bush's popularity at the end of his presidency.\n\n--Number of chips: Barack Obama's current popularity.\n\nThat's one disappointing appetizer. When I tried to request more \""George Bush popularity,\"" I was told I would have to order an entirely new plate, because \""George Bush popularity\"" has to be made fresh.\n\nLame political metaphors aside, my Saturday night experience at Downtown's \""other\"" theme restaurant was blah. The corn beef on my sandwich was tough. The waitress, while extremely friendly, forgot to bring my table's silverware. We had to ask for the utensils after receiving our sandwiches. At least the water glasses were kept full most of the time.\n\nLast night's experience at Cooperstown is demonstrative of most of my experiences at this restaurant. Just OK. The prices at this restaurant, however, lead one to expect \""good.\"" A better execution of this restaurant's menu and improved service would lead to my adding a third star in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My kids and I love this place. We have visited this location three or four times and the Chandler location once. We even turned my mom and stepdad into fans who visit the Chandler location often. We always get great service and tons of food. Tonight was no exception. My son had the Chicken Parmigiana and was extremely happy. My daughter chose the Cheese Mannicotti and Spaghetti, while I had the Meat Lover's plate with 2 huge meatballs and an Italian sausage with spaghetti and meat sauce. We each sampled each others and loved the delicious flavors. We don't get downtown very often, but when we can this is our restaurant of choice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We've eaten at Monty's a number of times and have always had good food there.   Service has also been good to excellent.   The veggie quesadilla is quite good.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Do not stay here!! My boyfriend and I had ended up here after our 15 hour drive from Delaware to Illinois. We were going apartment hunting in Champaign the next day and completely forgot to book a hotel room for the night. Of course the next day was move-in day for the Illini so everything was booked for the night. When we went to book a room, the night manager informed us that the cost was going to be $85 instead of the typical price since it was a \""busy week and the price should meet the demand\"" (thanks for basically saying your screwing us over just because you can?). When we opened the door to our hotel room I was greeted with the lovely smell of cat pee and mold. I think we were in our room for 2 minutes before I saw a cockroach on the desk in the room. I screamed, my boyfriend squished it with a napkin. After that I refused to sleep there so we went to ask the manager for our money back. The manager inspects our room and says he can't refund us because we already \""used\"" the room (I had pulled back the covers of the bed to check for more bugs) and that he needed to see the cockroach to prove we were telling the truth. My poor boyfriend had to dig through the trash to show the manager the dead bug. The guy then told us to re-make the bed and we would get our money back. Seriously? Oh and he also informed us that the roaches are usually downstairs and he had an upstairs room available if we wanted it. No. Thank. You. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great little yogurt place.  At first I wasn't sure about not being self-serve, but it actually worked so that I wouldn't serve myself too much and wind up throwing yogurt away.  I like how they layer toppings for you and are willing to mix and match. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stopped by Monday, the first day I felt it was nice enough to take my munchkin for a stroller ride.I like the simple clean layout of this place,no clutter and you can see a lot of the kitchen always a good sign. I asked the woman working the counter for suggestion. She pointed out the chocolate thumbprints and while she bagged those up I spied individual pineapple upside down cakes. So I scored 4 cookies and 2 lil cakes. The cookies were very good mixture of firm and gooey. The cake was realllllly delicious.Moist with a crispy kinda crust outside,just perfect. My husband did get his cake but i really had to restrain myself because he left it for over 24 hours! I ate all 4 cookies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinner!\n\nI've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.\n\nThere were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.\n\nWhen the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a \""hot\"" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It's gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won't soon forget.\n\nWhen we told the waitress that \""tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess\"".  Her response was \""It is for me too\"".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!\n\nEnter the \""Manager\"".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.\n\nIf any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).\n\nReady for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what's coming next.... What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!\n\nIn closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!\n\nGood luck here, and I hope your experience is better than ours was. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> \""it's just past castle boutique but if you reach le girls you've gone too far\""\n\nhahhahah!\n\n\nI have lived here for almost 3 years and I really like it. I have noticed that the quality of people has gone down a bit and the neighbors are more hillbilly-ish/hoodlum. \n\nI am in the process of buying my first home and hopefully they don't give me any crap when I leave.\n\nI think alicia covered everything pretty perfectly, and i definitely recommend living here. one thing that i will add about hating this place is they come to your apt a couple times a year to check the smoke alarm and filters. I guess that comes with renting? but i don't like people coming into my home when I'm not there. \n\ni posted some pics of the interior on my review of pruitt's furniture- check them out if you'd like to see the inside of the 1b1b :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.\nwe got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. \nthe bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. \n\nSAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99, you get maybe two handfuls of their fries with two small spoons of unidentifiable meat (pork? beef?!) and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station. \n\nthey do have their own radio station with great music, and fun books to read while you wait. regrettably the food was just not what we were expecting, and it is such a shame. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They sell their gyros in 4 sizes: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, and 8 oz. This is pretty neat as a large or medium gyro should be enough to suffice a hungry person. However, I have to say that their gyro meat isn't as succulent as I thought it'd be. The Greek salad wasn't anything special either. I gotta say that I prefer Niro's Gyros more. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went here to watch football on Sunday, and even though they were very very slow...service was lacking.  They seem to have a lot of regulars around the bar, who occupy the attention of the bartenders. Otherwise, being a \""regular\"" customer, it was hard to get service. I was also a little bit disturbed because the girl bartender, who clearly just rolled out of bed after a long new years eve celebration, was sitting on the counter..with her shoes placed on the SAME spot where they place the clean glasses--mouth down. \n\nThe atomosphere was great, and I think this could be a great place to watch a game, but wouldn't make the drive back out there with the service we had. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you are young and hot Miguel will move you to the front of line maybe even skip you a few more times just because he doesn't like the way you look.  I ended my service after 12 years of being a loyal customer.   This was not the only reason!  Just where I finally realized Verizon really does not appreciate its customers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's a place that is easy to both love and hate. On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors, but you'll probably have to slog through lots sub-par classes before you get the good classes. \n\nBusiness is one of the \""better\"" colleges, but you wouldn't know if from the lower level classes. My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ (econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department) class that was taught by a TA who not only didn't speak very good English, but who also gave really harsh tests. The first test average was a 64% and there was no curve. Grading is harsh here! Lots of people repeat classes. I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes, but it depends on the class I guess. \n\nLAS is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot. Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart. Contrast that with the much-funded engineering college's glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings. Oh well. \n\nACES, my college, is a bit of a catch-all college as well, but some of the majors are quite small. I've had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES. For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention. It also has top-notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science. I adore most of my professors I have had in this college. The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform, but I'm sure that is true in many UIUC colleges.  I recommend ACES, but only if you are truly interested in the curricula. \n\nI would note that I skipped all gen-eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests. If you can do that, it is worth it, because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics. The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul-crushing, with harsh curves, unintelligible TAs, and professors who just read off powerpoints. 101 classes are where learning goes to die. I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards, a sad way to \""learn\"" if you ask me. Don't be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day. I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English-speaking TAs. \n\nI am personally not a fan of the Greek system, which welds a little too much power here. The drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you don't find a niche. Allen Hall is the place to be for anti-Greeks/hippies/outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care. Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR, go six-pack only if you are Greek-ish, and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings. Dorm food is a mixed bag...it's mostly just inexcusably bad, but most people don't seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs= acceptable lunch. \n\nI like the Chambana area, even if it has some minor annoyances. Ill-kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on-campus grocery stores mar it, but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk-free places to hang out. However, I can think of about ten major cities where I'd rather live.\n\nThe weather here is horrible. In the summer you scald and in the winter you freeze, so pack your snowboots and your short-shorts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \""firesticks\"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stayed here for 2 nights while in Charlotte for business.  It's a very nice hotel.  The front desk clerk was very personable, friendly and accomodating.  My room was really nice and spacious.  I had a view of the city which was nice but I didn't get to really enjoy since I was not in the room much.  The bed... Heavenly.  The Westin is known for their Heavenly beds and it definitely was.  High thread count sheets and fluffy pillows... the best night sleep I've ever had while on vacation.  I thought about working out at the nice gym but the bed... couldn't get out of it.  Room service was good, but expensive.  $12 for pastries and fruit?!  Well it is room service and when is that ever cheap?  Had a nice stay and will probably stay here again if I have to come back to visit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to this cleaner for convenience. What a mistake it was. They absolutely destroyed my favorite dress. It went in perfectly fine and came out pink! The woman told me it was not her problem and that they weren't a magic shop! Absolutely terrible service. I have had the dress cleaned before with absolutely no problem. Use at your own risk. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> hubs and i went here once during restaurant week and partook in the special they had going. which was a discounted price of the 4 course classic option\n\nwe choose the Wisconsin trio cheese fondue, which I did not care for, the wine taste was really strong and a turn off for me.\nthe entree was really nice, we upgraded to the Mojo broth which is fabulous! i don't remember which entree we had but there was beef, shrimp and pork and chicken. \n\nwhen dessert came time we went for the yin yang chocolate. which we needed more of the dipping fruits etc because 2 pieces of each was not enough!\n\nthis is a nice strange of pace for a night out. allowing plenty of time to talk and eat slowly and just enjoy the company of the person you are with. i would love to go back only the cost is a little high to go regularly <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BUUUUUMMMMERR!!!! We ordered \""dinner\"" from here tonight and were seriously disappointed.  Let's start with the egg rolls- I could have bought something similar at the grocery store and heated it up in my oven; I'm not even sure the \""crab angels\"" had anything more than cream cheese inside of it.  Furthermore, I had ordered Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was pretty clearly the shrimp with vegetables.  And they don't have beef chop suey on the menu.  Seriously?  Really?  REALLY!!! I would have called to complain but after reading the other person's review realized it simply wasn't worth my time . . . We'll never order from here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food, the service and the management are all in need of improvement. This place has gone downhill. I used to dine here regularly, but will definitely not go back again as my most recent visit left me irritated and hungry. My family, a coworker and I arrived for an early lunch so the restaurant had plenty of seating. I requested a table below a fan because they keep this place too warm. My daughter requested a high chair for my grandson. These two requests caused such an issue that we ultimately decided to put my grandson on my lap. The server we were seated with was one who had waited on me before and I knew she had a lousy personality, but I opted not to request a different server so not to cause a problem. That was a mistake. When she brought chips & salsa to the table,  1 bowl for 5 people, I requested my own chips & salsa - it's an OCD thing. I was nice about it, but she was rude anyway. Oh well, I chose to ignore it and play with my grandsons. Then time to order...I was trying to get a ground beef taco with the shell the way I like, instead of the way they usually serve it. She was so rude about it that I finally said, \""just ask the kitchen and if they can't do it then let me know.\"" She made so many excuses that I'm still not sure which shell I should have requested when they finally changed our server. After all this, my coworker gets a dirty soup spoon. She requests another and ends up with another dirty one. She requests another spoon - again - and my daughter requests one as well. My friend ended up eating her cold soup with a fork - as much as she could. After several more issues I finally go to speak with a manager. While I was gone, the server made a nasty comment about our party to a nearby table . Unbelievable! We get a new server, but still no spoons, who tells us we cannot have the separate checks we requested because the manager took 50% off our bill. The only issue then was that instead of any discount at all, we had been over- charged. At this point my daughter, who never complains, actually went to the manager herself. I was given my remade meal to go - which ended up in the garbage. We ended up with a full comp, but would still never go back. So disappointing to see what has happened here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I recently had a horrible experience at Girasole. I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant due to its cozy atmosphere and decent Italian food. However, this past visit was unfortunate. The host was horrendous and extremely rude. I had brought my parents, who were visiting from out of town, and they were appalled at how rude the host was. Girasole is usually quite busy but it was also disorganized. I had made a reservation and arrived early knowing that there would be a wait. However, we saw three tables be seated prior to us, all of which had arrived much after us. When we tried to tell the hostess, he was even more rude than when we had arrived. To be honest, I could have overlooked the seating other parties prior to us if we had at least been given a friendly smile or a warm welcome. \n\nRegarding the food, it is adequate, nothing in comparison to other much more exciting and fulfilling Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been very disappointed in Avanti's lately. I used to love it. A friend and I each got groupons to go so I thought great can't beat half off. I hadn't eaten here in years. Nothing has changed it's dark and outdated. They need a Ramsey make over for sure. \n\nThe service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent. \n\nThe Caesar salad was very good. The veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good. The veal was rubbery and the breading soggy. The pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good. \n\nThe Tiramisu was soggy as well. The cake at the bottom was soaking wet. Yuck\n\nIf not for the groupon I would have sent this back. But half off an overpriced meal made me think I got what I paid for. \n\nWell we had another groupon to use so we went back. The second time the service and atmosphere the same. \n\nMe thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back. This time I had seafood risotto BLUCK! The Risotto was undercooked and had no flavor. The seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp. This Risotto was a disaster! My friends vegetables were mush. It was worse than the first visit. \n\nThe worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me. \n\nThe long and the short of it I wont be back. Avanti's has slipped to Olive Garden level with Macaroni Grill prices! WAY OVER PRICED. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> These guys did some customized work on a car I recently bought from a dealership.  When I noticed a very minor issue with the appearance of the navigational system in my car, I went into their shop to see about getting it fixed.  They were extremely fast and courteous.  I didn't have to make an appointment, just stopped in and they took the car in immediately to take a look.  They fixed the very minor issue and I was out the door in no more then ten minutes.  No questions, no cost.  These guys stand by their work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Benchmark of professional football.  Most superbowls in the sport.  Have the biggest fan following of all the teams.  Picked up steam during its dynasty years in the 1970s.  Before then, the Steelers were a terrible team.  Right draft picks, right coaching staff changes everything.  Today is one of the most feared teams in the NFL.  Their play represents the city.  Tough, blue collared in which any north east resident can appreciate.\n\nGrade: A <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  More authentic than places like Panda Express, but definitely not somewhere I'd go for quality Chinese food. I went with a big group and we ordered a variety of dishes off the menu. Overall their prices are low, but their food is rather one-dimensional. And they drench almost all of their dishes in thick sauces, making them feel greasy and unhealthy. \nWhile the service is good and they have a lot of seating for large groups, the food is nothing more than something cheap and filling. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is horrible unless all you want to do is drink alcohol.\nNothing but poor service and poorly cooked food. We were not greeted upon entering and had to tell them that we wanted to be seated. We were then brought to a dining room that had ball of the ambience of a school hall with plastic table clothes included. Our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation. When asked how the fideo was prepared, she said, \""they cook it\"".  Thanks captain obvious. My husband asked if there was anything spicy and she said the steak and jalape\u00f1o fajitas were. He then asked if anything else was and she said \""Well, the steak and jalape\u00f1o fajitas are\"".....she does not belong waiting on people. \nSo the food. The food is microwaved!! Soggy, gross enchilada, mushy and dry tamale, lackluster salsa, fideo that had been in a steam pan since yesterday. The highlight was the almost average fajitas. \nNo bueno ! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The other day, i took my holiday guests to share dinner at yourBiltmore location. My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change. \n\nGranted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience.\n\nI truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests. \n\nAnd if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now. You absolutely put the \""awe\"" in Awesome! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I had New Year's Eve dinner there. For the prices we paid (about $150+tax & tip per person), we expected better and more food. The food was just not that great. One of our dishes was cold, but they quickly replaced it after we complained. And the dessert was just not up to par. I only had a few bites and didn't want to eat more. So we paid like $300+tax and tip all together for not so great food. \n\nPlus the crowd who ate there was stuffy. Most of the women who went there showed up either with a mink coat or a mink stole (and the restaurant told us the attire is resort casual). And don't bother trying to make casual conversation with the patrons there. Most likely they won't talk back. \n\nYes, like what the other Yelper said - it's a stuffy, pretentious, uncomfortable and mediocre place. If you want good food and good service - go next store to J & G Steakhouse at the Phoenician. We had some excellent food for very reasonable prices there! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i can't speak for the laundromat, but the dry cleaning there was sub-par. i took in two down-filled winter coats, they took about 4 days. one came back in good shape, the other was wet, with the down filling in clumps. sure, they were polite and quickly took it back to re-do (dry) it for free, but i was coat-less another 3 days in the middle of winter, and that jacket simply does not \""feel\"" the same, i.e. seems thinner and colder ever since. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sandwich lives up to the hype! The cornmeal breading is phenomenal and it isn't greasy like some others.\n\nAs of 07/2014 food service stops at 7 PM on Friday. The sign looks like the one pictured but with a giant black 7 over the kitchen closing hour for Friday so I'd guess all the other hours are the same (I didn't take a very good look as I was focused on the deliciousness before me). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \""we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\"" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well if you think this is Authentic and great food the Mexican cooks you know aren't very good. I went with Authentic Mexican friends and none were impressed by the food. I called it mediocre and they called it less than. To me it reminded me of Home EC, Mexican food cooking lessons of the inexperienced Jr High Student. Oh, but wait... they don't teach Home EC anymore! So grading this meal (dinner) would be difficult. At least the waitress had a cool air about her that said I don't eat much of anything here, so you can't hold my opinion up to any of this feed. That's right feed not food. \nFurthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking. Sitting there reminded me of a pass life experience of eating and waiting at a bus terminal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed.  Bar service was slow, 45 minutes to get an appetizer from an inattentive waitress.  Once at our table, we watched our salads walk around the restaurant twice before the server found our table.  Waiter served the entrees and walked away, never checked to see how our meal was.  While tasty, the portions are small.\n\nUnfortunately, the best part of this restaurant is the valet service.  Don't frustrate yourself, dine elsewhere with friends. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> used to go before we hit the club. Nice to have a large group and sit down and shout out conversations. I remembered thursday is like an unofficial international day. Heard they had good fries; <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Getting seated wasn't difficult but after that the experience fell apart. We ordered  cocktails and water. The cocktails came in a timely manner but we only received one water. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the grilled scallops with butternut squash. The temperature of both dishes was cool. Almost room temperature. My husbands shrimp and grits were colder than my squash. The service was not professional. Being rushed to get the credit card out after receiving the bill. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> In my mind, there are two types of Indian restaurants in the Valley that I can afford to eat at.  There's the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge TV displaying Indian MTV or soap operas, and largely do-it-yourself service. (See: Kohinoor)\n\nIf I'm feeling like spoiling myself, I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls, friendly waitstaff, and a-la-carte style menus instead of \""specials.\""\n\nAfter a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.\n\nThe waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.\n\nThe palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.\n\nRE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.\n\nThe lady ordered vegetable bhriyani, which is sort of our Indian comfort food, and it didn't disappoint.  Flavorful rice with tons of veggies.\n\nIndian Delhi Palace has good food, good service, and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood. <|endoftext|>

Its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me. \n\nUnfortunately I don't know what happened? Michelle are you going blind? Are you okay? Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried, I weeped, i found myself in the fetal position. I'm no longer going back. \n\nI know some people have off days but this was BAD. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was standing on a corner eating my Peace, Love, Donuts donuts and thought I noticed signage for crafts. This word-\""crafts\""-can mean many things and with sticky, crossed fingers I darted across the busy intersection to investigate.\n\nI think the best place to enter this gallery is from 21st ST. This entrance leads you into the shop, or \""the Store,\"" which is what my review is mostly focused on. \n\nSo, back to \""crafts.\"" There are really talented contemporary artists featured here and the Store is a great place to get contemporary pieces for you, your home or for gifts. I bought two Brett Freund (PA artists) ceramic pieces and they were so beautifully wrapped I felt guilty they were only for me. Prices are varied, depending on size and medium and of course the artist. Whatever your budget, this \""gift shop\"" (another term I hate) is a must to check out. \n\nOne thing to note, I was there on Sunday, which neither the gallery or Shop should have been open on, so I'm not sure what was going on that day. The gallery was indeed closed, rather, roped off for the trading of exhibits but what I could see was exciting. This is definitely on the list to check out when I return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you don't already know this, Irish Pubs are known equally as well for their booze (ales, whiskey, and lager!) as they are for their \""pub food.\"" I award 5 stars to Ri Ra for exemplifying the latter quality in its lunch menu. Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip. \n\nAlmost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \""special,\"" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \""Christmas in a bun.\"" You decide.\n\nAND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win. \n\nI'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free). And you need to be beating the lunch rush, because once the special is out.... its OUT. Word has gotten out about the magic that happens at Ri Ra though, so don't get left behind :P\n\n5/5 <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Rhythm Room is all about the music. Great place to see national acts in an intimate setting on the cheap. Good sound system and perfect views from every place in the room. I think the furthest you can ever be from the stage while in the main room might be 30 feet. I'm not a beer drinker but don't always want to dive into a bottle of Grey Goose, so I like that they have Ace Pear Cider on tap. The bathroom is small but clean. My only complaint is the neighborhood - I'm always afraid I'll get jumped in the parking lot and am really surprised that my car hasn't been broken into there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.\n\nOn a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Rotten food and over charging customer.\n\nI was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant, but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout), denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu, which is 10% more expensive than online, led me to think the over charge was deliberate. \nThe crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food, it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stopped in here while checking out a few places around the 16th and Glendale/Bethany area.\n\nThis was about 2pm on a Sat afternoon. There was one person in there camped out reading a news paper and the rest of the joint was empty. This place has plenty of seating to support a lunch/dinner rush although I have a feeling its unlikely that it happens often.\n\nThe place did smell amazing. They had this enclosed smoker out in the middle of the ordering area. It was kind of cool to see the meat there smoking away.\n\nSadly I was unable to eat anything but luckily I had my roommate along. He has learned that when I say I'm going on a food exploration adventure that its a really BAD idea to skip it.\n\nHe ordered the rib snack which was three pork ribs and a piece of bread for $5-7. This seemed a bit outrageous to me price wise.\n\nThe ribs came out in a paper lined fry type cardboard box. It was in a small pool of sauce.\n\nI stole a few bites so I could write this. The meat was a very different texture. Best I can guess would be what another yelper wrote about it cooking quicker on a hotter fire. It was much less tender and had more of a spongy texture. I would venture to guess that these ribs has seen a freezer somewhere along the way from butcher to smoker.\n\nThe sauce.. blah.. I would describe it as tomato puree with minimal seasoning. Low sodium tomato soup! that's the closest comparison I can think of. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Eek! My sister and I went here a month or so ago, didn't have the most pleasant experience. Expensive I remember it...The service was depressing. Our waitress largely forgot about us and the other staff were all pretty apathetic. Had to wait ten minutes to get a drink refill, and the pizza was not very good. I haven't tried their sandwiches, perhaps that's their forte, but customer service certainly is not one of their primary concerns. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great Thai food here. Small place with limited seating but there is usually always an open table. They are heavy on the spice so beware. If you order Thai hot be prepared to sweat. Portion sizes are large enough to share between two \""non-starving\"" people. It's small and a little tucked away but definitely worth finding. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special, which was better, but still unimpressive. Realize it was only 12$ for dinner, and yet somehow still entirely not worth it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Although I didn't know it, I've been living under a rock for what must be ages because I had never heard anything about Fate. All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.\n\nWell played.\n\nI wish I could say the same about Fate.\n\nMy dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. \n\nWe didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, \""Fate.\"" \n\nI really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. \n\nAfter entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. \n\nAfter paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.\n\nThey were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. \n\nIt tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, \""I'm never coming back here again.\"" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.\n\nFate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am not sure what the fuss is about this place. I will give it points for a unique interior; I mean it is not very often that you can eat a plate of spaghetti while sitting in a giant velvet throne, but the food is very ho hum. I grabbed dinner there with some friends before heading to a concert in Glendale, the concert was after work, and it was a good middle meeting place. \n\nFor being an Italian restaurant, I thought the menu was really limited....nothing really unique, mostly just pasta and sauce combinations. The salad that you get with your meal is just the cheapo iceberg, which is not even worth eating. \n\nAlso, they advertise that they can make any of their pastas gluten-free, which excited my sister, but when she tried to order, she was informed that the only gluten-free sauce they have is the tomato, so she went with just a salad, once again, chock full of that icky iceberg lettuce. \n\nThere is way better Italian food out there people! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It is so-so.   I went in on  a Sunday morning so it was pretty slow.   The employees were busy talking so they did not great me when I came in and then I asked for them to clean some tables.....I got a sigh and the guy went and cleaned the tables.   Not a single clean table in the place.   You would think if it was that slow the place would be clean! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Can't beat their happy hour! Food comes out fast and fresh. Sometimes I do find that I'm looking around for my server to bring refills/the check but for $3 sushi rolls I really can't complain! The decor is not what you'd expect to find inside but who cares when the food is this good? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I agree, quite likely the worst Subway on the planet. The employees do not care 1% about you, or your order. I'd rather have a sandwich from the dining hall in all seriousness. Don't waste your time, even if you crave Subway - because this location will make sure you never crave it again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I live in Texas and my wife took a business trip to Verona.  She realized she left something very important at home, so I contacted a business in Madison to purchase it for her.  I contacted Union Cab for their courier service to get her item to the hotel. While I had some difficulty using their web site to place my order, Robert helped me get things done over the phone.\n\nHe also gave me a follow-up call to let me know that everything is processed and my package should be delivered on time.  I appreciate all the trouble he went through to help me take care of this problem.  He also let me know that he'd be working with his IT resources to make sure the web site works correctly in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place makes really, really authentic Mexican food.  It's part restaurant, bakery, and grocery.  I go here for the Burritos.  Big, soft, house made tortilla and filling! I always order green chile, chicken, deep fried.  It's sooo huge, but good!  You can do Enchilada style or plain, option to add your typical toppings like Guac, sour cream, cheese, etc. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite hole in the wall neighborhood bar.  Whether I wear my suit and tie, or a T-shirt, I always feel comfortable here!  The drinks are cheap and strong, and the bartenters are nice too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like this place. I'm not the type to switch barbers often. But after moving, researching and trying out different places (for the last year) in downtown Phoenix, I think I've decided on Central Barber Shop.\n\nI've had my hair cut from a few different barbers there. Roman is quick and good. I think he might be the manager, or pit boss or something...  I've also had my hairs trimmed from a gal who once asked him for advise in Russian, I think.... Anyways, she ended up doing a very good job as well. I actually prefer Roman and second the blonde gal right next to him. I've also had my hairs cut from a gentleman by the name of Boris. \n\nMy hair is always done well. Pricing is decent. And Dutch Bros Coffee is right next door. North West corner on Central & Camelback. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Came here for the works wash and thank goodness I had a free voucher cause I wouldn't dare pay 16 bucks for the crappy job.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> (This is the first time I felt the need to voice my opinion on yelp and this being such a personal matter, I hope it is useful to future women in my shoes).....As a first time expecting mom, this office has catered to all my obscure worries and fears with care. Always making me feel at ease and answering my questions to fulfillment. I had the unpleasant event of waking up with a kidney stone at 3 a.m. To make matters worse, try typing in \""contracting lower back pain, third trimester pregnancy,\"" on the web, instant scare considering I am only 29 weeks. I  called the after hours number and my call was returned by Laura, literally within two minutes. She calmly instructed me to go down to maternal triage at my hospital. I was greeted by Dr. Thompson, who just so happened to be hanging out at the hospital at 4 am, and treated within 45 minutes of making my first call.  This experience alone makes me feel confident when I go into labor this Sept, I know I will have the support of the team as promised. That right there takes a load off my shoulders and gives me the opportunity to enjoy the last few months of pregnancy. \n\nFurthermore, all my appointments have been pleasant and timely, their follow-up is reliable, and the staff is very friendly. Reading another review regarding the lady at the front desk... Don't let her fool you. She is a sweetheart and you will grow to like her. Not being chatty Cathy doesn't mean she isn't helpful or good at her job. \n\nMoral of my review: They have done an excellent job handling a high-matainance, over-reacting, scared to pieces, mom-to-be. And I couldn't be more pleased. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The sushi is always delicious, especially the ones listed on the underground menu (the volcano roll is to die for). We always go there for every special occasion. While it's true that the service is slow on Saturdays due to their all-you-can eat sushi special, I otherwise have no complaints. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ditto to Patti's review below mine... I recently switched to this 'discount dry cleaners' and I'm saving tons of $$$!  It is great quality and I have not had any problems yet (knock on wood)!  Every item is just $1.99 unless you bring in a coupon that they send out every few weeks direct mail and then you can get it for $1.75 each - even better!  \n\nI've even given them items that say 'do not dry clean' by accident, and they've caught them and refunded my money.  Be prepared that you pay when you drop off, and you need to pay with cash or check to avoid any additional fees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ran into this place on the way from the airport to Grand Canyon and had a great time there.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!\n1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries\n2-Fresh ingredients and great prices\n3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out\n4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)\n5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)\nSo, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everything went well. Nice, comfortable atmosphere. The Doc knew what she was doing, even pointed out and old scar on my eye that I had never been alerted to previously! Didn't get the actual hardware there (kinda pricey). Would recommend to anyone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers\""...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very small selection of food.  a little over $7 total with tax and drink.\n\nOne long tray of fried chicken.... only one thing missing. KETCHUP. Why bother eating fried chicken if you can't have it with Ketchup?\nNo refill in drinks except ice tea. \n\nI gave two stars because the fried chicken actually tasted good.  If you like eating loads of fried chicken. go to this buffet. Just bring your own ketchup. lol\n\n I will never go to this buffet again, except if i have a massive craving for fried chicken. <|endoftext|>

We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready. \nI ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I felt lazy to drive to a better place to eat, but since it was next door I came here. The staff isnt the friendlyest and the food reflects it. They are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich. You get more at Subway, if you want to compare. Also, for what they charge your better off going to another place. If you want a really good sub sandwich, go to Jimmy Johns. They have much better service, food and always have a friendly greeting when entering or leaving there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The TV reception is absolutely horrible. I have emailed Prairie athletic club a couple times in regards to the situation.

But the guy at the return desk was awesome. He had to get on the phone and pull some string, and got our return to go through. I knew, going in, that we may not be able to get a return, so I am so thankful for this guy that worked so hard for us.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think Jordan's is a staple for the community. It's one of those restaurants that make you feel like you live in a small town. I've been going to Jordan's since before I could walk. My dad grew up eating Jordan's with his friends and we always went here for a quick mexican bite. Now I'll tell you I didn't always love the salsa. It's strange and I can't explain why but after years and years of coming here as a kid I fell in love with it. I now probably eat Jordan's at least once a week. The food is affordable and while the service isn't \""express\"" the wait staff is always friendly. A few of them even remember my order before I order it. For the people who think it's gross. Not every place has amazing everything. Jordan's definitely has its super star items. I always get the tamales, tostadas, open cheese crisps and flautas. As for the salsa they have the same old salsa every other place has as well. Just ask them and they will bring it out for you and if you ever have a problem talk to the sweet man who owns the place. Help keep places like Jordan's around instead of generic places like Chilis. <|endoftext|>

After asking a few of my marathon-running colleagues, I visited Runner's Den for the first time today. I learned a few things. 1) Different running shoes meet different needs, 2) Athletic shoes, like dress shoes, come in different widths, 3) I have a wide foot, 4) I walk on the balls of my feet, 5) Normally people walk heel-to-toe, 6) My feet lean in toward each other, 7) So that's what my trainer kept getting on my case about, 8) I will never again buy running shoes anywhere besides Runner's Den, ever. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  HOW does this walmart of wedding dresses stay in business? As Luckie mentioned you set up the appt, yada, yada. I went 2 years ago with my best friend and not only did the sales person let us know we were wasting her time she also told us over and over we were picking the wrong style for her 'beach wedding'. She brought us about 5 different dresses that were the exact opposite of what we asked for. It was horrible! \n\nRecently I revisited looking for a cheap evening gown. Only bonus: everything is in stock so you can try on the actual dress despite your size. HOWEVER, going in and asking for a specific dress they don't have? FORGET it! The girl sent to help me told me that not only did they not have the style, the only way I could get it was if I paid in full ahead of time, and it was NON RETURNABLE! Even if I never brought it out of the store!! Calling other locations to see if they had it was a major hassle for the girl, thanks, no thanks, bye bye! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They are going out of business.  Can't compete with Home Depot and customer service was always pretty bad, too. I remember the last time I was here in the August and I asked one of the clerks if she'd already swiped my credit card. She laughed and said: \""we don't do computers here,\"" with a sense of pride. And now you're out of business.  Go figure! LOL. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Good food and good people.  Ordered pickup on they way between work and home without a menu.  The owner walked me through the menu - basically I asked if they had it and either they did or they would make it for me.  Cannot complain about that.  \n\nFood was good, not the best I ever had, but certainly better than most. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Absolutely five stars! Every time I come out this way to see family I make an attempt to stop in.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  As your standard restaurant, Atria's has no personality: the food is blah, the service is eh, and nothing is really all that memorable.  The patio and it's proximity to the ball parks are its saving grace.  \n\nNow, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, \""No substitutions!\"" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.\n\nOverall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, \""he just must be on his period.\""\n\nWhile Atria's is fine for a glass of wine before a Pirate's game if a table is open outside, I certainly would never book it again for a private function. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  As a car-less denizen of PGH, I rely on PAT buses to get from Point A to Point B.  Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\n\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\n\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\n\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\n\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\n\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\n\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\n\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\n\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews, I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say, \""well, what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?\""  Well, some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly, this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out, but their food is just as shabby.\n\nTheir sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick, gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded \""Best of Charlotte\"" frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago. \n\nIt's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't believe I'm writing this. We've been enjoying hickory river for years. Tonight was an epic fail on customer service. I called at 4:45 pm to place a carry out order. The person took my order and repeated it perfectly. My dad arrived to pick up and they  had nothing under the name given. He got out of line and called me. He waited in line again with me waiting on the phone. When it was our turn he handed phone to the person. I told her who I placed that order with she stated he was busy. I told her our order. She said oh yes I see it and repeated it. It was partially wrong so I corrected and she said ok and hung up. When the food arrived it was totally wrong. So disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love walking into a restaurant and being enticed by the aroma of good food.  We had a light dinner. Hummus and pitas. Gyros. Hypocrites salad. Followed by a desert that I can't even begin to pronounce. Everything was very good, and I loved the normal portion sizes.  \n\nOur waiter was superior.  Attentive, yet not too.  I'd love service like this everywhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Leidan Mitchell Salon (the Indian School location) is about a 5 minute drive from my office. After three separate attempts at contacting the salon on three separate occasions with no answer or returned phone call, I decided it was best to stop in on a Saturday morning. \n\nI was looking to make a nail appointment and did not expect to be accommodated the same day (especially on a Saturday). However, the receptionist exclaimed \""of course we can fit you in, no problem\"". At that, I proceeded to sit in the center of the salon for 15 minutes. I watched the front desk girl approach multiple nail techs all of whom seemed to be busy and/or annoyed. The receptionist returned to let me know that, in fact, they did not have any openings. When I inquired when the next opening would be she took my number down and said someone would be in touch with me soon. \n\nAbout three weeks have gone by now, and I have yet to receive a phone call. When I called to follow up, again, there was no answer. When I expressed the difficulty I was experiencing in terms of getting in touch with someone the day I went into the salon - the receptionist gave me a confused look and did not even take the simple, logical step of confirming the number I was dialing (although this is the phone number listed on their website). \n\nAll in all, I was turned off by the simple lack of care I was shown as a new potential client. At the very least, a professional establishment in the customer service industry should have a scheduling system (whether paper or electronic) that allows them to easily relay openings to, and book appointments for, interested clients. They could not even offer that. \n\nNo establishment should ever leave a customer feeling that their business is not needed, but unfortunately Leidan Mitchell did just that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow, kind of let down.  I have been to other locations and always received a pretty good meal.  Most likely between 3 and 4 stars.  On an early Saturday evening, I walked in to an empty restaurant.  I order the combo: two tacos and one quesadilla with rice and beans.  My order was to go.  I live about 7-8 minutes from there.  \n\nWhen I got home my food was room temperature.  It was like they pre-cooked the meat and then just warmed it up quick when I got there.  My quesadilla was a bean taco, yup definitely NOT a quesadilla.  That is it.  Not impressive.  The side of rice was great.  The side of beans was salty.  It is just not what I am used to from other La Bamba visits.  \n\nStep up your game. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Has been years that haven't been there and I am still pissed at how poorly we were treated there. Maybe it has changed but I will never step foot there ever again. Food was OK I guess but the service was horrible. If you like your food to be thrown in your face by the waitress and you have to clean up HER mess, you should go there. Oh, and bring your own utensils since they don't seem to be willing to provide them. The manager couldn't have cared less, the staff just seemed to be going thru the motions. Horrible experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Parking there is a pain in the ass. The ever popular MPD wasted no time in ticketing 10+ cars parked around the corner. The signs read, no parking between 10 PM and 5 AM - hrm, seems be aimed directly at the Bar business. WTF.  Perhaps the obnoxious, money grubbing city of Madison could consider issuing *warnings* first, or make the tickets a nominal fine, like 5 bucks. Oh, we can't do that and still fund the liberal bike boxes, can we ? Or buy snow making machines. So instead of wisely spending money, they'll sock it to people out and about. Way to go Madison. \n\nThe bar itself is fine, plenty of room, except, the bathrooms - they should put in MORE! There were girls in the men's bathroom waiting to use the stall. <|endoftext|>

They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and I'm not sure what that's all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didn't find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didn't hinder the waitress. Won't be going back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  For years I endured the Phoenix New Times. I read it..because it was free (isn't that why anyone picks it up?).  But my story about a brief discussion with an editor says it all. \n\nI wrote to the editor to explain my disappointment with a particular article. I actually said that they were doing themselves a disservice by calling this particular story \""real\"" since it was actually a farce; that's not journalism, its fiction..yet this publication continues to call itself a news source. \n\nAlmost immediately, I received a reply from the editor. When I saw it in my \""inbox\"" I assumed it was a \""form\"" response. You know, \""thanks for contacting us, blah blah blah\"".  Imagine my surprise to see that it was from an editor, personally insulting me and my intelligence! After the initial shock of receiving a poorly written personal attack from an EDITOR, I replied only that he had \""eloquently proven my point.\"" to which he responded again with another insult. I decided that I was the bigger person at this point, and stopped communicating. \n\nSince then, I have never picked up a New Times or any of their sister publications. I encourage others to stop justifying the New Times existence by even so much as lining their bird cages with it. What a waste of trees. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago. My story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already. Incredibly lousy customer service and an owner who could give a damn about filling orders and delivering service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to come here a long time ago when I lived in the area and since I recently moved back to this side of town I decided this was close and I'd start coming back here. Well, unfortunately I won't be coming back here ... Ever. And here's why...\n\nI came in today as a walk in and was asked \""what I need\"" and I said I wanted gel, then was told ok \""one minute\"" and so I went over to the seating area to wait, as I knew \""one minute\"" was not going to really be one minute and that just meant I had to wait, a strange way of Asian nails places to get you to stay and wait? When really I'm usually okay with waiting and expect it if I don't have an appointment. It's be nice if there was more accuracy in that regard, but oh well I'm used to it who cares right?\nWhatever so I'm sitting there waiting and 2 girls walk in and seem to have been familiar faces to the owner (so I assume) up front, the same guy who \""greeted\"" me (if that's what you want to call it) there was \""hi how are yous\"" exchanged and they were asked what they want they said \""both wanted a full set\"" then were told to wait over in my direction. They came sat right next to me and as he was finishing up with his customer and she was paying he yelled \""would you like a pedicure too\"" and I assumed he was talking to me because I was next right? But before I could say anything the girls answered yes. So he went back to his station and motion to come over and sit down, again I'm thinking this is me because I had been waiting and therefore I was next (or should have been) the two girls said quickly \""both of us?\"" And he shook his head as they got up to walk over there and sat down. At this point I was like really? That's not cool. It's one thing that I was skipped but another thing that I was not even acknowledge nor did he say \""I'll be right with you\"" or something of the sort. Kind of rude, but I continued to sit and wait for him or someone to motion me on over but as I looked around and realized that was not happening any time soon, I just got up to walk out. As I was walking out he nearly screamed at me \""WAIT JUST ONE MINUTE\"" again and I politely said \""no thank you\"" and continued out the door. \n\nObviously he took precedence over the two girls, one because they were familiar customers, and two because they were spending more money than me. \nI came in gym clothes with no make up on and looking kind of haphazard from working out... Had I been all dolled up I have a feeling I would've been treated differently, based on how I was treated alone. \nIt's too bad because I am a loyal customer who is in the service industry myself, therefore tip very well. \n\nWORD OF ADVICE: you should really think about they way you do business, especially when there a 15 other nail salons within a half a mile to a mile radius. \nThanks. But like I said, NO THANKS. <|endoftext|>

They seem to mess up on special orders so beware.... They speak Spanish to each other a lot and makes us feel uncomforatable, makes me think they're talking about us.... and it's just plain rude!  My biggest complaint is that they were swepting the floor right next to our table, literally right on top of our feet...It's like EXCUSE ME,  I am trying to eaty here! I don't want dust flying up into the air and landing on my food! They have done this there a few times now!  Why do they have to sweep & mop right next to the customers! It's annoying & insanitary I feel...  The ceiling fan s were also on full blast, further stirring up all the dust! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pane Bianco is one of those neighborhood places that we've wanted to try for years but somehow haven't gotten to.  So I suggested it for lunch today and off we went.  We were very pleased all around.  The ambiance is great- kind of rustic Italian chic with low and high tables, a bar, and a takeout area next door.  The service was fantastic.  It took maybe 3 minutes to get our food, although sandwiches and salads aren't too taxing to make, and it wasn't crowded.  Still, it was noted and much appreciated.  I got the Caprese salad.  I debated between that and the sandwich, but finally decided on the salad because it did come with bread (which I definitely wanted to try, it being PANE Bianco, but sometimes sandwiches are just too bready).  I spent 2 weeks a couple of years ago literally eating my way through Italy on Caprese salads, and this was as good as many and better than some.  The tomatoes were red ripe and tasty.  The mozzarella was fresh, and it had just the right amount of basil, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Yum- thinking about it now makes me hungry all over again.  The bread was as expected, fresh and crusty.  I also got the pickled vegetables, which were good and interesting.  It was a plate of baby carrots, onions, cauliflower, and peas pickled in what seemed to be apple cider vinegar, so they were sweet and sour at the same time.  Sweet Pea got the Soppresata sandwich, which came with the chile Soppreseta today (which was great, as we are both notorious spicy hounds), and he really enjoyed it.  It also came with sort of a saucy cold bean salad, I think they were lima or fava beans, which he didn't like but I LOVED.  I ate all of his too.  They serve Mexican sodas but aren't too precious about it- always appreciated.  We will definitely be going back, and I will go by the takeout for a loaf of bread when I'm having a party.  Good to know there is a good bread bakery around! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The best place to get a beer in Charlotte, period. I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 \""pint nights\"" where everything on the wall (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat ANYWHERE!\n\nThe glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn't offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great too. It's awesome to be able to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.\n\nThe food at the bar is, well, bar food. If you're expecting something amazing for dinner here then you're definitely here for the wrong reason. While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.\n\nThe one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable. The saving grace is that there is a great patio outside where you can go if cancer isn't your thing.\n\nOne final personal note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  \n\nBarb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.\n\nI know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  uggggh!  That this how I feel at the moment when I think about the Slippery Pig. I had such high hopes for this place and could have given them so much business but damn how hard is it to order a part? I keep getting the run around \""we just have to order a fork.\"" Meanwhile my friend has dropped off 3 forks of various sizes to help move the process along faster. \nSome creep who acts like he's too cool to talk to a girl who likes to ride bikes straight up lied to me about timing when it would be ready. I have it writing, fool! When I went in to check out the status of my bike on the day he promised the bike would be ready that same creep immediately got a strong attitude. Just a reactionary guy I guess but seriously he scared me.\nSo after getting the run around going on 2 weeks of hearing \""we are going to order the part tomorrow\"" I'm picking up my bike today and I'll just fix the damn thing myself.  I fully expect my bike to be destroyed when I go in to get it. That's just the kind of confidence I have in this place. Bummer. <|endoftext|>

It is not only clean, but impeccable.  The staff is quite firm on the rules, which I was not made aware that a lute may pass through their customs, but not my British Honduran macaw or Belizian soy nuts.  Ho hum.  I had to insert them into the bowel of the plane, which is right where I told the wanded lady to stick her apparatus. \n\nI wandered up into Terminal Four, exceedingly the only port worth venturing from, with its hoards of awful fat inducing foods that I would never let my indulgences approach.  So, I had several plates of Chili Cheese Fries and four bloody marrys at Fox Sports Grill to block my urge from any of the other filth this corporate consortium of overfed Americana bestows on its citizens.  Filth!  Not me.  No way would I indulge here.  \n\nThough Terminal Four is quite a pleasant atmosphere, and allow myself to reiterate, the best port of exit, there is a severe mass of human activity.  If you are like myself, you won't enjoy the egregious offense against good reading at all of the newstands and boutique book shops around the mall area.  The \""Somebody in Arizona Loves Me\"" apparel is without shame entirely!\n\nStill, if I must leave my beautiful burg in the sun, I enjoy the comforts of this guttersnipe and bawb babble infested airport.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped in here for lunch one day last week.  I had been wanting to check it out for a while since it is just down the street from my office.  The reviews saying it was expensive kept me away but now after seeing the menu I don't think it so bad compared to other places in the area.  You really can't get a lunch for less than $10 anywhere in Old Town Scottsdale unless you do fast food or the food court in the mall.  I thought the place was decorated super cute and with a nice relaxing atmosphere and the staff was very friendly.\n\nBut the food was just kind of average.  I had a 1/2 panini and soup and they both pretty much tasted like something I could make at home.  I also took home a couple of pastries (now those are way overpriced, I agree) that also were not too impressive.  I will definitely give them another try just since they are so close.  Hopefully some of their other menu items will be better.  They did have great smelling cappuccinos so I may try to sneak out some time for a mid-morning coffee and croissant.\n\nI think this is a cute little French cafe to stop by for a quick lunch if you are in the area but I would definitely agree with Suzanne S. that it is not a destination restaurant at all.  There are a lot better options nearby. <|endoftext|>

I can't complain much about the ambient, cheese, food, and wine, but when it comes to the time to pay, some server charges excessive amount of service tip on your bill. You need to watch out for this and need to sober up!\n\nOne of the servers told me that the tip amount for the group gathering (6 people or more) is 18% out of the total before Tax, but when I received the bill the gratuity was 23% AFTER THE TAX amount. (I realized this when I saw the bill next day). So I over paid the tip although I thought the service was OK. (I asked for a glass of ice water several times, but the server was keep forgetting my requests).\n\nAgain, if you are planning some group event here, please watch out for the tip unless you believe the service is superb.... <|endoftext|>

I have never had any issues with my teeth. I had a cavity that I got in my 20's. The filing was getting old and I had it redone. About 6 months later I changed dentists to Dr. E bc she is a cosmetic dentist and I was interested in pursuing veneers for my two front teeth, which are mainly composite (from a gap that never closed with braces and from several chips).  After her first visit with me she told me the tooth I just had the filing redone on needed to be crowned because there was a lot of decay. She appeared to be very knowledgeable and I went ahead with her proposed treatment plan.  She's very personable and makes you feel great, like she's the best in the business, don't bother driving to Scottsdale she says, bc she can give you best treatment in Anthem, same lab, cheaper price, and her work is perfection.. so she says. Getting the crown was painful, it did not go without a hitch, and after this experience I would not get veneers in her office. I referred my husband to her for a cleaning bc new patients got free teeth whitening. My husband went and got his teeth cleaned and walked away with a laundry list of items he needed to get done, including more crowns. After getting a second opinion, he did not need the work she recommended, he did not trust her integrity and never went back. After another routine cleaning there, she said I needed another crown on a tooth where I had a filing. Apparently her x-ray showed decay and in her ledger notes she wrote I needed to get it \""taken care of ASAP or risk a root canal\"". This concerned me, bc my typical appointments with dentist run very smoothly, aside from the 2-3 cavities I had in my early years. After a second opinion, I was told that was absolutely ridiculous. Then her staff followed up consistently to get it scheduled... so you can make sure you \""use up all of your insurance by the end of year bc it doesn't roll over.\"" I got a crown on a tooth that I likely didn't even need. I have had two dentists since, both have confirmed I did not need that second crown she recommended. Three years later, the second tooth she recommended I get crowned hasn't been touched and it's 100% fine, yet I know have major issues with her crown work, as a result I may need an extraction! SEVERAL other residents in Anthem have had similar complaints and lawsuits!........ I will say this, they are aware that I am not happy with my experience there and while I will never step foot in their office again, they offered to rectify the situation. I will be filing a complaint with the AZ Board of Dentistry.....and the other person giving the review, Jamie W. works there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This actually turned out to be a pretty good place for a girls brunch! \n\nTheir brunch menu isn't that extensive but the prices are just right! I went with the shrimp and grits which comes with collard greens...yep, I said collards!!! \n\nThe shrimp were seasoned very well and not overcooked at all! The grits had a creamy texture...not like what I expected but very delicious. And those collard greens were on point!!! So good that one of my girlfriends ordered a side to take home! \n\nI also enjoyed a slice of the chocolate silk pie. I'd definitely hit this place up for brunch again! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't like this airport very much in particular the US Airways terminals. They need updating, more power outlets, renovated bathrooms, etc. Terminal B is just horrendous.\nI only gave them the two stars because of the Southwest terminals which are great or else it would only been the single star! If you travel through here try to avoid the US airways terminals if you can. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break?  What happened?  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.\n\nBASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.\n\nTV:  \""Saturday NIght Live's\"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  \""Seinfeld\"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included \""Murphy Brown\"", \""Evening Shade\"" and \"" Northern Exposure\"".\n\nMOVIES:  The top movies included \""Lethal Weapon 3\"", \""Basic Instinct\"", \""Hone Alone 2\"", \""The Bodyguard\"" and \""Aladdin\"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  \n\nMUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released \""Lucky Town\"" and \""Human Touch\""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had \""Automatic for the People\"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album \""New Miserable Experience\"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies \""Gordon\"" featured the cult classic \""If I Had a Million Dollars.\""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.\n\nTECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by \""sending in\"" or by calling an \""800\"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  \n\nAnd OJ Simpson was still a football hero.\n\nSo that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  : (\nHubby was craving Carl's burger and we were in this neighborhood, so we ended up here...\nA few odd things...\nHubby had the Western burger and I had the bacon guacamole $6 dll burger... Staff was friendly, food was OK. Mine had a strong flavor, like cumin (I guess I do not like cumin very much) but I didn't know if it came from the guacamole or something else.\n\nMy sweet potato fries (large) were like half. While the container was flat on the tray it looked full, but once I picked it up... I swear, it was almost half...\nHubby had the criss cross ones and that was reasonably full, but the odd thing is that he asked for large but the receipt said medium.\nStraws? They only had short straws by the fountain drinks, which barely stick out of the large cups, like a cm or less... I went and asked if they had long straws and they immediately gave me a couple from behind the counter... o.O\n\nLike some other yelper mentioned, the tables, seats and floor look like greasy... \n\nAaaaand, to top it off, my hubby noticed a bug behind me... and it looked to me like a tiny roach (like 2mm).... : ( those brown ones with a yellow spot...\n\nYuck... please remind me not to stop here ever again... : ( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My first LGA experience...won't be back unless someone begs me. Omelette was served cold, too busy to care what the plate looked like and no silverware clean. The place was packed. Why? <|endoftext|>

They are super friendly, have never tried to \""sell\"" me all the extras that you sometimes get when you take your car in for an oil change.  Their oil change is very extensive as well.  You can usually grab a coupon online for $22 for the complete oil change. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We've eaten at Saba's for years now, and the food was always good. Last night we got our dinner to go, and it was pretty bad. We had the calamari appetizer, which has always been wonderful. Last night, it was undercooked, it was practically raw, and it smelled fishy. If we had been dining in, I would have returned it. I had my usual Falafal sandwhich, and it also wasn't very good. The Greek fries were soggy and limp, not crisp.  I don't know what was wrong, if it was just an off night, of if they are going downhill. I have no desire to go back, and it was one of our favorite restaurants. I give them 2 1/2 stars, because they used to be 4 stars in my book. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best bargain in DT PHX. The hotel is half the price of some of the other downtown hotels, and is only a few blocks away from restaurants, the convention center, US Airways Arena, and Chase Field. I paid $100/ night when some of the other DT hotels were charging close to $200.\n\nThe hotel has a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport and has a full breakfast included in the price of the hotel (eggs, breakfast meats, waffles, bagels, english muffins, oatmeal, cereal, etc).\n\nThe rooms are a little dated but there is complimentary wi-fi in all the rooms. Beds are incredibly comfortable and there are new flat screen TVs in all the rooms. \n\nMy only complaint was the amount of chlorine in the pool and spa. I went in a brunette and came out platinum blonde.\n\nRecommended. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is my only 1 star rating since using Yelp. We waited 20 mins to be seated that was no big deal. After we were seated we noticed that 3 families that came in after us were seated and had drinks and chips at their tables We had not even been greeted. Waitresses avoided our table handed out checks refilled glasses to other customers. I have never felt so disrespected. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please do not give them business. Owen's has the worst customer service and quality of service. You are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner. First, they messed up one of our pants badly. I understand that dry cleaners cannot always clean clothes the way you want, but I have never taken clothing to a dry cleaner and have it come out WORSE than before. When I say they messed up one of our pants, they destroyed it. I went back to let them know and they didn't even say sorry or anything like that. Rather, they were extremely rude and defensive. Did I mention, that they messed up my pant!! .....and still had the audacity to be rude. Amazing.  I tried to politely (even though they messed up my pant) ask them about their dry cleaning process to find out why/how my pants came out worse and they were still rude. \n\nFor your own sake and peace of mind, do not give them business. Not only are they of poor quality, but they don't deserve your business from a customer service stand point. I would hate to know that my dollars are going to a low quality and disrespectful business. And they are not even cheap....at all. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Alright.. A-hem... er, F*** I hate giving poor reviews! This place isn't HORRIBLE, but it most CERTAINLY isn't as good as what they charge for it.\n\nI went here for lunch today because I was feeling adventurous. I felt the need for something new, and it was a toss up between Cypress Grill and this place. Unfortunately, I picked THIS place... We sat down and ordered my 4 year old the corn dog on the kids menu for $3.50. I ordered the 1/2 shrimp po'boy and chicken/sausage gumbo $10.50, and my wife ordered a chicken po'boy and gumbo of the same $9.50.\n\nOut comes my son's corn dog.  It was nice that they brought that out quick, because kids get anxious when waiting for their food. As do some adults, I suppose... nonetheless, it was one of those frozen-type corn dogs that you can buy by the box... As soon as I saw this, my feeling for adventure was snuffed.  The food DID come out fast. I'll give them that, but it was a bit shy of good.\n\n1/2 Shrimp Po'boy: Keep in mind, they charge $10.50 for a full sized sandwich.  My sandwich had maybe 5 shrimp on it, some lettuce and two small pieces of tomato on the side.  The horseradish sauce was, indeed, good but there lacked anything GOOD to put it on. So I just dunked my two dry pieces of bread and 5 shrimp in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the taste.  The taste was good. but the price I paid doesn't constitute what I received.\n\nChicken and Sausage Gumbo: I must admit, my wife ruined this one for me.  She mentioned how it reminded her of the canned soup of the same, and, I sh*t you not, it DID taste like canned soup! the chicken was SUPER mushy, and the sausage tasted like they bought a kelbasa, sliced it up, and added it to the soup just before serving. It was not good at all.\n\nI can't comment on my wife's po'boy, but it didn't look much better than mine. Two pieces of bread with some chicken. Meh...\n\nThat's right, I said it! Meh, Meh, Meh!!! And with that, I will be making a Meh list to put this in... Actually, I think I already have one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We came here on a Friday night with high hopes with great recommendations from friends. Can we say very limited menu? Looking at the prices, I was expecting a more seasonal selection. Our server took forever to greet us. She barely even knew what the daily specials were! We heard the server at the next table list a couple of specials that our server had no idea about. Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special. Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good. The string like fries were tasty, just a bit salty. For the price and poor service, won't be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  WORST SERVICE EVER!\n\nThe service is OK in the store, but NEVER call them for a repair! You probably will find  something better in Craiglist. Repair department is really unprofessional and unfriendly, their priority is send you a bill instead of customer satisfaction. You will find other reviews here stating the same, so save some time and money and call somebody else for repairs and try Costco or Online stores for supplies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We would not dine there again.  The food was bland and flavorless.  The atmosphere and pasta weren't bad.  My husband also said the espresso wasn't bad.  I think they cater to the over 65 crowd. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I needed to order catering for an event at work.  A coworker called to pay for the order, and was told that they \""don't have alfredo sauce.\""  She then passed it it back to me so I could reconfigure my order.\n\nI'm sorry, but what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't have alfredo sauce before their dinnertime rush starts?  It's a white sauce.  MAKE some.  It's not hard.  If it's too difficult to make some, perhaps you should run out and buy some.  I have a feeling that not everyone who went to Geovantis that night was satisfied with their one option: Marinara sauce.\n\nBut I digress.  On with the story...\n\nThis is a phone conversation that actually happened between me and a Geovantis staff member:\n\nMe: Hi, I'm calling back about my order--my coworker tells me you don't have alfredo sauce?  \nSM: Oh, right!  No, we don't.\nMe: ....Like, you don't have it ever, or you're just out for today?\nSM: Yeaaah, we're just out today.\nMe: Oh...okay.  So, I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo because it's vegetarian.  What else, aside from the cheese tortellini (which I'd already ordered) is vegetarian?\nSM: Umm....hold on.  *puts me on hold for a few minutes*  We can make stuff vegetarian for you?\nMe: Oh, no, that's okay.  Let's just make it two cheese tortellinis, then.\nSM: Okay!  One cheese tortellini, one cheese ravioli...\nMe: No, no, you don't have to make cheese ravioli special, since it's not on your menu.  Two cheese tortellinis will be fine!\nSM: Oh, okay.  *Proceeds to spend a few minutes figuring out the rest of my order until I confirm that it's correct.*  Now, what kind of sauce do you want on the Chicken Parmesan?\nMe: .....I'm sorry?  \nSM: What kind of sauce do you want on your Chicken Parmesan?  \nMe: What do you mean?  Isn't it marinara sauce?\nSM: Yeah, you can either get marinara sauce, or alfredo sauce.\nMe: ...........Considering that you don't have alfredo sauce, I guess it would have to be marinara sauce.\nSM: Oh!  Yeah!  Right!\n\nSeriously.  That sound you hear is of me banging my head against the wall.\n\nAnd the food is only okay.\n\nBut, if you like the food, the portions are really cheap and HUGE. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am going to give 4 stars for our first time there. The servers were really nice and the food was surprisingly good for a bar. They have the standard burgers and appetizers, but they also had wraps, soups, salads, pasta and deserts. I was shocked with the choices they had. \n\nWe went as a large group so food was a little slow coming out, but worth the wait. I will absolutely go back there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent food, great service. I've been coming here for about 7 years, both dine in and take out, and have never been dissapointed. Everyone I take here (chinese friends included) are impressed with how good it is. Highly recommended <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good.  I am part Iranian, so I know my Persian food.  Meat here is cooked perfect...very tender.  Came with a large party once and the owner (who is super nice and accommodating) brought us a sampler of all the meat.   In general, I love to order the ground beef kebabs and lamb kebabs at Persian restaurants and this place doesn't disappoint (I like to add sumac, which is on the table to all the meats and sometimes the rice).\n\nOnly disappointment for me is that they don't have a clay oven to make homemade Persian lavash bread like they do in all the restaurants in Atlanta.  Instead you get pita before your meal.  It comes with onion and feta.  You can ask for mint and eat it with the bread, onion, and feta.  Sounds weird, but that is common in Persian restaurants.\n\nEggplant dip is very good and is a must in any Persian restaurant.  I wish they had more than one eggplant dish, though.  Ice cream is really good.  Baklava is good, but not the best I've had.\n\nDefinitely a must try in Charlotte! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Postino Winecafe remains very close to my heart. In a foodie way, too.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \""Gum\"" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)\n\nThe first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter: \n1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste.\n2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together. \n3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon.\n4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!\n\nHe and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!\n\n\nThere's a $3 charge for Valet. But it's all worth it!\nI am definitely coming back for their bruschettas once I fly out there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My sister mentioned this place was always busy when she drove by so we figured it must be great.  Wrong.  We went for Sunday brunch this past weekend it was about 50% full.  We sat down, got our drinks and food orders in right away and so began the 35 minute wait for our food.  I had the salmon with capers and my girlfriend the salmon, eggs, cream cheese.  Both dishes were tasty but there was hardly anything on the plate.  If it wasn't for the delicious croissants and jam to start us off, I would have been just as hungry as when I arrived.  Luckily they threw in some complimentary deserts in at the end for our party and that made things a little better.  Still, I won't be going back.  There are better brunch places out there for the money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been to Giuseppe's several times.  Food is quite good.  Service is ok. Prices are too high.  Each time I've been to G.'s they have run out of something.  Once it was pasta.  Another time it was another key ingredient.  They say oh, this will be as good but it isn't.  They try to talk you up to their home made pasta but it's only one kind of pasta.  So spaghetti carbonara with the upgrade isn't spaghetti carbonara at all it's fettuchini carbonara.\nThey do make an excellent Tiramissu.  However, the cost is as much as a whole meal at other restaurants.\nIt's a good, overpriced restaurant but I would rather go to another restaurant which is equally as good such as Christo's.\nNEVER arrange to meet friends at Giuseppe's for supper .  They don't take reservations and your party can easily cool your heels for very long times.\nWould I go if you were paying the bill?  YES\nWould I go on my own?  NO <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Our whole family loves Spanish food and since we were all in Champaign for the football game we decided to check out a \""new to us\"" Tapas restaurant.\n\nWhen we arrived at 2:45, the kitchen was not open but would reopen in 15 minutes.  We decided we could easily wait so we snagged two tables outside and ordered drinks.  The waiter delivered the drinks and took our tapas order so he could put in the order as soon as the kitchen opened which was a marvelous idea!  Before you knew it we were sipping on Sangria and our food began to arrive.\n\nWe tried the cheese plate which was outstanding.  I could have just eaten that and been happy.  The mussels were grilled which had a pleasant taste but the grilling did dry them out.  The biggest disappointment was the Spanish tortilla, the traditional egg and potato omelet of Spain.  This had been prepared like more of a quiche and no one at the table liked or ate it.  I adored the fantastic lamb meatballs, we even ate the sauce with some of the bread which came with the cheese plate.  The other tapa I tried were the marinated olives which were not nearly as good as I had expected.  The marinade was so vinegary, not a smooth flavor at all.  I would not order that again.  We shared everything but there were some dishes I didn't try as I had ordered paella for my entree.\n\nThe paella was really really good.  It had a spicy chorizo but it did not overpower the overall rich saffron/olive oil taste of the dish.  The rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender. What a treat!  I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.\n\nWe had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful.  When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.\n\nIt was a great meal with the family but very expensive.   Next game, those kids are getting pizza or burgers!  \n\n \u00a1Ol\u00e9! <|endoftext|>

I had one that was faulty and after contacting Costco.com through which they were purchased, a new shade was sent within a few days. The customer service rep was professional and friendly. Many people have said they are some of the nicest shades they have seen. The fabric is stunning. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  PHX:\n\nRight now, the Phoenix airport is more of a 2 star airport, but it is undergoing a lot of renovations so I applaud the effort.  Sky Harbor International has an incredibly long way to go before it can be considered in the same class as some of the nicer international airports, let alone inside the U.S.  The terminals feel drab and dingy.  The old Southwestern-patterned carpets don't help, though there are eye-pleasing murals decorating the walls of some concourses.  Relatively low ceilings and limited window views of the outside coupled with dense passenger traffic can make some sections of this airport feel downright claustrophobic.\n\nSeriously though, entering this airport feels like taking a step back in time.  Remember the retro Taco Time theme of brown and burnt orange?  That's what Sky Harbor feels like.  Speaking of food, the restaurant selection here is abysmal.  Fortunately, the aforementioned renovations include the addition of several new eateries including local concepts.  There's currently a lot of on-going construction.\n\nAt least the future is bright for Phoenicians.\n\nFree Wi-Fi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR.  The manager, I believe of indian or Syrian decent is one of the most prejudice individuals I have ever met in my entire life.  His attitude is discussing.  Please join me in boycotting this establishment.  I will never, ever eat here again.  Nasty, despicable place. I will forever let any person who will listen to me know that this place is a throwback to Jim Crow days. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Okay when it come to salad bars Sweet Tomatoes by far tops the competition such as Soup or Salad or your run of the mill salad bar. I usually go here with a buddy or two for lunch about once a week what's really nice is if you sign up for their news letter, they send out coupons usually twice a month so someone is always eating in our group for free or 50% off. \n\nAnd what is really nice is they have different specials every month at this place so you are always able to try new things. \n\nThe vegetables seem fresher here,  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars, and they definitely have more of a selection then most places, so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups, baked potatoes, pizza and other such dishes to choose from.\n\nThe staff is really good here and this place is very clean and everyone does a great job in making sure you are getting everything you need. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is the fact that I feel it is a bit pricey for a salad bar. <|endoftext|>

The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  \n\nFor the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. \n\nThe music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.\n\nTo Rob, ogromnoye spaceba! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Decent prices, good food, portions keep getting smaller....but the kicker is the horrible service you'll receive! We always give places more than one shot, especially if their food is good...but every time we go we are so disappointed at the service!\n\nThe chefs are nice and entertaining, especially for kids, but their servers don't seem to care and ruin the tip (which they split)\n\nThis last time, we went on a Friday round 6. Moderately busy, but seated right away. Our server seemed so bothered by us, never saying you're welcome when we thanked it (it was more if a grunt/irritated \""ya\"") and the portions were much smaller. I swear, the more people at a table, the smaller the portion. If you get served last, expect to be jealous of the first persons huge serving. \n\nThey charged an extra $1.75 for fried rice, which I don't mind but I do expect more than 2 pieces of broccoli, one mushroom and a decent amount of zucchini and onion. My chicken dinner cost around $16, and the best part was the Shrimp sauce,  \n\nThey served my husbands combo with teryaki chicken instead of regular hibachi and when he told them it was wrong twice, our chef pretended not to hear and turned the fan on. We were so annoyed at that point, we didn't push the issue...paid our $50 tab and bolted. \n\nWon't be returning. Given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fast friendly service, good food, no complaints. I was able to get in and out in less than 10 minutes during the lunch rush on a weekday. That's tricky to-do in downtown phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They were recommended by a friend and we used them once with no real issues. This last time was horrible though, really poor & unprofessional customer service. They underestimated virtually everything - cost, time, delivery etc. I usually give companies a few shots to get it right but I will find a new place to take my clients rugs in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a customer service based review, The one star is for selections because this store has items other locations often do not. \n\nDisclaimor / Accountability check todays incident which I am writing this review on is partly my fault... the part where I got zero assistance from customer service is their fault. \n\nSo I stopped here for ground lamb for an awesome stuffed mushroom recipe... I like to think I am speedy and smart when I need to be so I run through self-serve checkout. This is my third grocery store stop of the day. Warning!! for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags!!\n\nI accidently leave a bag in the self serve area but do not notice until I return home..... eek. It's ok though because I have my receipt, upon returning home in about 20 minutes I phone customer support. \n\n\""Hello I left a bag in your self serve area I still have the receipt is there anything you can do?\""\n\n\""Let me see if it was reported by our staff.\""\n\n\""Ok it was ground lamb...\"" \n\n\""Nothing was reported yet so there is nothing I can do unless its reported.\""\n\nI pause and think to myself.. really nothing.... even go check the area yourself to see if its still there?\n\n\""Again I ask oh really is there nothing you can do?\"" While thinking to myself basic problem solving skills nothing fancy....\n\n\""No I am sorry nothing we can do.\""\n\nHmm well if that's it then I guess I will go to Whole Foods the next time I need something fancy and overpriced for a recipe. Who ever got my ground lamb or didn't enjoy it on me... \n\nI heard Whole CEO treats employees badly this is an ethical issue for me but sometimes you have to make a personal choice based on your experiences. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We have been here a number of times, and I have enjoyed it more and more each time.  We have gotten such phenomenal service.  Our last server was great and allowed us to tweak anything we wanted in terms of substitutions and omissions.\n\nWhat I love best about the place is that dinner is an experience and you get to relax and enjoy the large variety of food in your own personal little section.\n\nThe prices are very high, so we do not go here much, but this is a staple for restaurant week. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It can be good, it can be bad. Never attempt to order food for delivery from here. It will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy. There is much better drunk food. There is much better sober food. \n\nChipotle is better than this Qdoba <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When the bookends of your meal are the only strong points then you aren't going to score strongly in my book.  The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.  \n\nAs for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.  \n\nI ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish.  Let the fish do the talking.  There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish.  The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar.\n\nThe desserts were very good however.  We went with the Tiramisu and \nSemifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello (Milk Chocolate and carmel ice creams, chocolate cake, toasted meringue, crushed toffee).  \n\nThe decor was definitely cool inside too.  Maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna?\n\nLidia's, the trying too hard, portion controlled spot in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I gotta give my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  The upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  Steve and Clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  This is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  The food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had.  The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  I  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now.  I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  There's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have only been to Wild Thaiger a few times and have eaten food they catered for a private buffet dinner at the restaurant most of those times. The Pad Thai is a favorite of mine. I love their Iced Thai Tea. The atmosphere is nice, the service is top notch and the food is constantly good. They also have a full bar with happy hour. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food looked great, but unfortunately we didn't get to try it because of the wait.  \n\nThe wait, of course, doesn't deserve the two-star rating - but the service does.  We waited for almost 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the angsty teen hostess with glazed over eyes, only to be told the wait would be 45 minutes.  Lazy Thaiger. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place was wonderful all around. I would return and I would recommend. It is a bit higher price point, but it is such a great space it is worth it. If you are looking to get away, relax, have a romantic weekend, enjoy nature, this is a great place. If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it). \n\nThe first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. \n\nOur room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land. \n\nHe had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from. When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests. \n\nBreakfast was delicious. Farm fresh eggs from their hen's, herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local. We had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the owners.\n\nGreat place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just came over here and the influence of Yelp easily made me try it out as I do pass by here quite a bit.  I was so surprised by the exterior that I wasn't sure of it'd be that great of a place.  Originally looking at it, it didn't even look like a sit-down from the exterior, boy, I was surprised.\n\nThis place is great, I loved every part of it, from the bread to my takoyaki appetizer and my ramen.  The people caught on really quickly that I drink a lot of water and kept the water coming which is very difficult in my opinion.  It's weird but one of the major points for me that I care about.\n\nThe food and the service was fantastic, the wait was a little longer than I thought it should be but it made up for it.  Also the place is disguised on the exterior in my opinoin and I would've taken longer to come here without the reviews here.   I'd give it 4.5 if I could because of the wait on the food but I hope it's better next time.  I will definitely be returning here again.\n\n----------------------\nI just took the full star off.  Should be 3.5 stars now.  The last 3 times I've been here, it's too much waiting.  It took 40 minutes to get my food the last time.  I think something needs to be done about the wait time and why doesn't the waiter ask me how I'm doing or bring me water?  I appreciate those kinds of things! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My experience tonight fell very short from my normal experiences at Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time coming to this particular location to celebrate Valentine's Day with my boyfriend.  It was a very busy night which was expected and the staff handled the wait time exceptionally. Our waiter was very prompt and extremely tentative. My issue with the restaurant is with the way they handled a food health issue. We ordered the flat bread pizza as an appetizer but as we began to eat it we found plastic melted underneath the cheese. When we brought up the issue we were apologized to and explained that the flat bread comes wrapped in plastic. We still paid for this item on our ticket even though it was clearly a mistake the kitchen made. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went last night with in-laws for mother in laws bday.We always have loved the place and it is our go to place when we have something to celebrate and even when we don't.  Walked right in, we're seated, server was pleasant. Mentioned it was for mother in laws birthday and she was nice about it.\n\nOrdered drinks and an appetizer. ..This is where things went slightly pear shaped. Server came back and told us the appetizer was delayed. No big beal, things happen. \n\nFood comes and as always, was completely wonderful. Chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers. More pear shaped, waitress was no where to be found for 20 minutes. Wife was out of beer and spicy food minus drink.....she waited. Finally I got up and had to get another server to get a refill. She started with \""I am not your server....\"" but said she would take care of it. To her credit she did. \n\nManager comes over, very nice, apologized for the appetizer and days she will cover it. Server shows up and is rather standoffish. Not rude per se but moody. Not sure if it was my stunt with the beer or the manager but either way not our fault. More waiting for desert, more drinks, something and then the server does show up with the bill no questions asked, not a thing.\n\nThe rating is not for the appetizer,  like I said things happen. It was not for the lack of drinks, it was for the apathy. At least come by and check on us, tell us the app is coming, but the server seemed to say, \""the app screwed my tip so why try\"". If the place was hopping I would get it, but it was early afternoon. \n\nAnyway long story short: great food, apathetic service, use to be a go to place even with the hour drive but we may\n be finding another one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This year marks the 15th Year 40th St has been open. This year marks the 1st time I have been there......That is a sad thing. This place is exactly what I want. \n\n1. Homemade food. I am not talking about just the soup either. \n\n2. Small and friendly \n\n3. Good prices and portions to match \n\nI had the meatloaf open faced sandwich served with mashed potato's and corn. It was the best I have had in years. Maybe the best ever. They wrap the ML in bacon while cooking it. It gives a good flavor to the meat and they even slice some of the bacon in with the meal. \n\nPS the biscuits look amazing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visited on March 1 for dinner with a large group. It was super crowded, pretty noisy (these are things I can forgive if the food is good). Service wasn't great either, there were only 3 servers and they were working pretty hard. We waited a long time for our orders and about 2 people had to wait a really long time for their food.\n\nThe chips and salsa were eh, ok. I ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco, no sides. The food was bland and not too flavorful. Unfortunately, a person in our party found a hair in their taco. After hunting down our server, she quickly took it away, but there was quite a wait for the new plate.\n\nIt's cheap, but I wouldn't go back unless I had no choice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very terrible service, waitress did not khow what she was doing. Did not state her name, walked by us twice with out asking if we needed anything. Someone else brought our food, we had to get up ourselves to get napkins. Someone by the name of Justin apologized, who was he? Then someone else came up by the name of Joey{who was he???} and said drinks are on us, unfortunately both burgers have been taken off for our Birthday's. Really un-proffesional. they could have put them back on our card's. The worst Birthday burger ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is so busy - it is most definitely not a hidden gem, although it sits back in the neighborhood.  The food and coffee are good - but most of all, I like that I can walk my dog here to get coffee and the newspaper on the weekend.  I wish that there were more places that allowed pets outside. \n\nThe parking can be a pain and the ordering and picking up of food can be chaotic.  But, once you get settled - this is a good place to visit. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I shop in the strip all the time.  I come to Stamoolis for a few things:  feta, stuffed grape leaves, and olives.  They have lots of Greek items, so if that's your thing, you should swing through.\n\nThey have something like 8+ different types of feta (French, Bulgerian, Greek, Greek Barrel, etc.) I didn't know there were that many different types until I came here.  The stuffed grape leaves are my bench mark for grape leaves.  Dilly, lemony, a bit sour, stuffed with rice...I love these things here.  I also get my olives for dirty martinis here...pick out your olives, get them weighed, and then fill up your container with brine and...voila! the best dirty martini brine you can find, for practically free.\n\nThey also have a relatively extensive cheese selection, albeit nothing as compared to Penn Mac.  It's definitely cheaper than Penn Mac though, so if you're looking for smaller quantities, or some more common cheeses, check here first. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For some reason, probably a reason associated with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation, I can't ever remember the name of this place.  Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:\n\n\""hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks.\""\n\nor\n\n\""Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon.\""\n\nSince most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.\n\nI sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric \""food.\""  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.  \n\nOld Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.\n\nI've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience. \n\nI didn't order breakfast because I am not a \""breakfast food\"" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.  I hope to return to Train Tracks of Brass Railroad Bar soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went there this weekend to compare quality and price to moon valley nursery-I am not impressed at all first off they said they wouldn't price match second of all there trees were at best sub par-so i went to moon valley nursery in avondale and got a ton of trees for the price of just a couple of trees at Whitfill trees plus the Whitfill nursery warranty isn't good. I would definitely recommend going to Moon Valley if you need trees <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's a great community. It's on a busy street, so if your loved one is a little \""confused\"" at times, just be aware of that. The people who live there are wonderful. The management has a few kinks to work out, but the nurse practitioner, the ladies at All Care services, all wonderful people.\n\nI want to stress here though that the management is terrible. They change hands so frequently that it just becomes ridiculous to expect any kind of consistency or organization. There is a kind of creepy right wing Republican vibe from one manager, who desperately wants to get rid of the \""freeloaders\"" (anyone who gets any kind of benefits, which is just insane in an environment like this!) **Yes, I'm looking at YOU Mrs. Crane!** then an easy going, \""let's see what we can work out for you\"" the next month. \nIt's extremely unfortunate and I wish it weren't so. Dealing with them is like being stuck inside a yo-yo. If it weren't for this huge liability, this community could be much more successful,  appealing, and desirable. I know it must be a very competitive market in Phoenix for senior care, but I just think this place is the absolute pits when it comes to their business practices. Not a lot of integrity. I can't speak for the entire Holiday organization, as I have heard tremendous things about other locals in other cities/towns, but this one seriously needs some expert advisors to give them a bleepin' clue! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I did a driveby of this place earlier in the day, and did some research.  I heard it closed at 8pm, and was told they have Chihuly glass on display.  That is all I needed to hear.\n\nParking was free, and was plenty of it- I managed to get a front row spot!  We got there around 5:30 pm, thinking there would be plenty of time to see everything...\n\nWell I was wrong!  It started to get dark around 6:30, and for that, I missed out on about 2-3 trails- that sucked because I wanted to see everything... Hopefully since it is daylight savings now, you can enjoy the gardens now at a later time...\n\nThe parts that I did see were fascinating, although at parts it did get kind of boring (we started from the left and worked our way around).  I was told there was even a concery there for the evening- which sounded cool- but I wanted to explore, having never been there.\n\nI would like to go back and see what the entire garden has to offer, since the desert portion at the Atlanta Botanical Garden just doesn't do it justice.\n\nI think it is cool how it is next to the zoo (which I didn't get to visit), and two parks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The decor is less vintage and more just hasn't been cleaned or changed in a few decades. The portions were smaller than you'd expect, which my girlfriend suggested might be a harken back to the day. Problem is the prices aren't proportionate. \nMy pastrami and Swiss on marble rye was pretty burnt and fairly bland. The potato salad hardly had any flavor.\nI thought perhaps my taste buds were off except the root Beer float was pretty tasty. \nWatching a waitress pickup spilled food off the floor with her bare hands, throw it away, then turn around and serve two plates to other customers did it for me. \nThe ice cream was good, but other places know how to scoop from a carton too... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The place has gotten quite a dramatic face-lift. It looks great. I love everything they've done with the place.\n\nI tried the Tip Top Burger and the chili. The burger was fine, but not spectacular. The chili was really freaking delicious, though. I would highly recommend grabbing a bowl. \n\nThe space is pretty small, but there is actually a lot of seating. It does get pretty loud though. The staff members were all very nice and did a great job. The bitchy people  next to us were treated a lot nicer than they deserved. A waiter mixed up an order and was very apologetic and quickly resolved the issue.\n\nOverall, I'm happy that the place is finally open. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Update!  I've since not had a problem with the tea tasting old, and have had a couple of salads that were much better.\n\nBest burgers in town, in my opinion. They're always cooked to perfection, with an appropriately proportionate bun and delicious, thick, crunchy pickles. And, if you're pretty starved, I suggest getting fries on the side. They're toasty brown and delicious, especially when doused with malt vinegar.\n\nThey also have a full bar and great apps, specials, and desserts. I sometimes just get the hummus plate app for dinner. And the fish n chips special is pretty darn good for being land locked. As for desserts, if they happen to have the chocolate chile cheesecake, DO IT.\n\nThe environment is very laid back and the restaurant is fairly dim. There are a couple of TVs, but if you don't like to be distracted, you can sit away from them.\nBeware days of Illini games; they are packed to the gills at dinner time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Vincent's remains my all time favorite. It's been ten years since I have been here but the quality is the same. The spinach salad had warm sauteed mushrooms and bacon with a balsamic reduction all in perfect proportions. The duck confit wasn't on the menu. No problem. Vincent prepared it anyway and is was to die for. The brown sauce was perfection. Then, just when you are ready to cry uncle out comes the souffles and chocolate bombs. Spoon in a little creme anglais and you have gone to gastronomic heaven. A comprehensive wine list that might be weighted a little too much on the high end on the French side but plenty of good California choices in the affordable range. This is a very special restaurant with a world class chef that is a treasure known to all Valley of the Sun natives. Don't miss it. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When me and my boyfriend came in, we noticed that the interior design was nicely decorated. As we were being sat, we noticed the table was literally five inches away from the table next to us. Not enough room for me and my boyfriend to leave if we have to go to the bathroom. We could not hear ourselves talk because of the conversation going on 5 inches from us. next, The buffet food selection was only eight to nine different things. The food was okay but lacked the spices and taste. The reason its not a one star is because of the excellent service we had gotten. The food was warm and nothing was heating it. We would not go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Was thrilled to see vegetarian options. Very nice restaurant, clean, fun decor. Son absolutely loved watching the planes land & take off. Best moment was seeing plane land & pilot came into diner- was very cool for him. Had California Benedict which was good not great- not best Hollandaise but wasn't expecting gourmet granted. Liked fruit cup that was offered, good variety. Average diner food but good menu options and above average atmosphere. Host was delightful but service was slow & spotty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Carl's Jr is my guilty pleasure place for burgers. They make it when you order it so service is a bit slower than your usual fast food place but, it is worth it. I actually crave their fries after a long day at work! <|endoftext|>

Salon 3121 has yes, an ugly facade in an unattractive strip mall, but a nice interior with friendly people. I found myself welcomed with coffee, iced tea, etc. It wasn't crowded, which I like. Overall, I had a good experience here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Want to take your special date to a posh dinner? Dress fancy and get ready for a dining experience at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had to take Todd W's advice...goat cheese salad! The food was delicious! We ordered the cheese plate to start. It was proportioned well and the cream, the hard cheese, paired with the fruit and honey were just right. For the main entree, I ordered the vegetarian couscous and hubs got the veggie special of the day. Both were made fresh to order and I savored each bite. It was so good that even as full as I had become, I couldn't stop eating until it was almost gone. The wine list had plenty to choose from to make a nice pairing with your entrees as well. \n\nThey try to source what they can from local farms and they make a menu to reflect what is fresh for the season.\n\nI love having a 2-hour dinner without feeling rushed; it makes me feel high class. The server was very nice and attentive, giving us time to enjoy the experience.\n\nSave your Benjamin's and when you're ready to splurge treat yourself to a night at Carpe Diem! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting. Everything is slop on a plate. No one should come here and pay these prices. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and remarkably low-priced. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Since moving from the Ahwautkee area I don't live as close to the salon I used to go to or the gal that cut my hair. I debated making the drive out there for a hair cut and staying loyal to my stylist, but I'm lazy, so I needed a place closer to Central Phoenix. On a tip Ide Mania was recommended (thanks Thomas S.!!). I was prepared that I would be paying $55-$65 for a hair cut which seems insane, but this cut was worth it!\n\nStephen was my stylist and he is simply awesome! From now on I only want him to cut my hair. Not only did he do an amazing job, but he is from Manchester and I finally got to talk to someone about all the great music from that area of England. \n\nThis salon has a nice, laid back atmosphere. The gal (Gina) that works the desk is so friendly and makes you feel very welcome. \n\nI love Aveda products and I'm glad this salon offers their line. \n\nI'm now saving money towards my next hair cut at Ide Mania. It's pricey, but this was the first time I walked out of a salon and have been totally happy with my hair. Big thank you to Stephen for being so awesome!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just had the worst customer service from the management at the  Chilis on Camelback and 20th st. As a long time former employee of the company, I'm even more appalled! Sad day :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Buyer beware. I had purchased my fianc\u00e9's engagement and wedding band from Jared and was pleased with everything. So my fianc\u00e9 went to purchase me a watch for a wedding gift. The man sized the band for me and we left the store. The watch sat in the box for about 2 weeks until I tried it on again. I decided the watch wasn't for me and wanted to return it with in 30 days. My fianc\u00e9 was running errands and tried to return it to the Concord store where they were rude and told he to come back to this store. Once she arrived the general manager was extremely rude and calling her a liar saying the watch was worn and he got a phone call from the Concord store \""warning him\"" about my fianc\u00e9. We had to take our issue up with corporate and posting on their Facebook page we were finally able to return the watch. Beware once they get your money they will burn you on warranties and returns. Just go look at their Facebook page. It's nearly all complaints on it when other jewelry stores Facebook pages have not even half as many complaints. Stay away from this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  lousy food, fox news blaring everywhere (what's up with that??).\n\nbut free wifi.\n\nand a three-letter code that's fun to pronounce! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My favorite Irish bar in Charlotte and probably the friendliest bartenders I've ever met.  I'm no beer connoisseur but apparently they have the best Guinness in Charlotte because of the short length of the line from the keg to the tap.  I've tried it and I can at least concur it is good!\n\nThe only take away for me was the lack of lighting in the place, last time I was in there it was very dark and only lit by candlelight.  No biggie, but when I'm having a beer after work with a buddy, I don't really need the romantic feel of candles....hahaha.\n\nIn short, if you want to grab a beer and be greeted by some of the friendliest bartenders in Charlotte stop in here sometime.  \n\nBTW, it does get pretty packed during the weekends and can get crowded. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stopped in during happy hour for a light bite and a drink. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of their house Cab. With one other person at the bar, you'd think the service would be reasonable. The only other time I saw the bartender was when my glass was empty. I ordered another thinking she'd offer me a menu at least...never happened!! So I paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat. Btw, my bill for 2 glasses of \""house\"" wine during happy hour was more than $15!!! Other servers appeared to be much more customer-focused. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  RUDE, unprofessional salesperson!  I kicked him out of my home within 3 minutes of his arrival.  \n\nHave you ever tried to purchase a new air conditioner?  All companies want to meet you in your home and take an hour of your time to give you a quote.  With that in mind, I took a full day off work and scheduled 9 AC companies every hour on the hour to give me quotes.  I met all companies at the Maricopa Home and Garden Show last weekend and in person made appointment and told each company was told about my scheduling and that they may even run into each other.  They all said they understood and agreed, even Integrity (the business card given to me was for Ross Carlisle, \""Comfort Consultant\"").  \n\nOn appointment day Integrity was to arrive at 1:00pm.  He arrived at 1:33pm.  After opening the door he didn't say hello, he just said, \""Someone's already here and cutting into my time.  I don't normally do this, but I can't wait all day.\""  Despite his initial rudeness, I invited him in.  As I showed him where the AC unit was located outside, he continued his rudeness.  I reminded him that when I made the appointment they were told that I had other companies here the same day to give quotes.  He made other snarky remarks to which I asked, \""Is this going to be a problem?\""  He said, \""No, but I've been waiting since outside for 30 minutes.\"" I asked if he rang the doorbell.  He said, \""no\"" and said more remarks clearly indicating that he didn't want to earn my business.  I stopped him there and told him to leave.  I told him that if this is the way I was treated during the sales process (30 minutes late and rudeness). I can only imagine how bad their service would be. \n\nThe irony here is their name:  Integrity.  Based on my experience, they don't have any. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Took an out of town coworker on 1-8-13.  It was very slow, only two other tables so we thought we would get excellent service from Thomas, our waiter.  Well, that didn't happen.  He was MIA most of the night.  In fact, we had to ask another employee to get him so we could order.  Thomas we not very friendly at all and acted like he did not even want to be there.  I still tipped him 20%, because I have worked in the business many years.  My best tip is writing a review and simply not going back.  Simple as that.  Finally, it was a cold night and they did not have the heat on.  Nothing worse than eating and freezing at the same time!  The food? It was just OK <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like this place...a lot!\nI wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of mexican food (I like a lot of the places here in Phoenix and Scottsdale...a by-product of being raised where everybody thinks Taco Bell and Taco Time are \""mexican food\""), but I know what I like and Ranch Market's cafe is terrific!!\nI met a couple of friends here for lunch today, and was, as always, happy and full when I left.\nI had tameles today (my touchstone for the best in mexican food)...they were great...hot, soft, perfectly spicy, with the sauce ( I do believe I am getting aroused!  OK back to business.\nI have had burritos, various tacos, the hot dogs (nogales style), the sopa's and you know what? They are all really tasty and the people at Ranch Market are really nice.\nThe prices are cheap (esp. when you compare the prices to some of the pricier mexican restaurants that, frankly, don't measure up, taste-wise and quality-wise to this cafe).\nLastly, I could make a meal of their chips and salsa, fresh made, warm, spicy...I'm getting hot again.\nGo to Ranch Market, enjoy that cafe, you'll be glad you did! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  (Only commenting on Ri Ra as a bar as I have not tried the food) Get some more staff! This place is terribly understaffed, on a Friday night there should not be only 2 bartenders for a packed bar. Easily takes 10 min to get a drink. I like the space and the patio but it means nothing if I can't get a drink. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I come (or should I say USED to come) to this particular McDonalds about once every three months for three years because of the convenience of the location. It's hard to screw up fast food to this level, especially for a huge, international company where you have low expectations to begin with. This particular store sets the bar to a new low. I will never be back. The staff teams are consistently rude or passive, the food is thrown together sloppily, and the place is almost always a mess. Things like a drive thru that always takes longer than most, the trash cans inside are usually full,  and the best indicator of bad management - the bathroom is disgusting. I'll keep on driving to a another one next time as I am sure it can't be worse than this one at the corner of Gold Hill Rd and SC hwy 160. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> La Grande Orange is one of my favorite breakfast places. I always try to make a stop here whenver I'm in the Valley. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a view of Camelback Mountain. The place always seems to be packed whenever I go, but that just shows how good it is. You order at the counter and can sit in the market, the pizzeria, or outside (be warned, seating is hard to find at peak times). There are two places to get coffee, one inside the market and one in the outdoor seating area. On top of serving good food, they have a small gourmet market that sells all sorts of things related to food. I had the daybreaker the last time I was here. It is an egg white omelet with turkey and tomato-avocado salsa on top. It is really good. It has a very fresh taste to it and it feels healthy, yet satisfying. I had bacon on the side, which was excellent. It was nice and crispy, as well as full of grease, the way bacon should be. Overall, if you're looking for a great breakfast place in Phoenix, head to LGO. I have yet to eat lunch or dinner here, but I hope I can next time I'm in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Replaced my watch battery and fixed the inside of another watch for $5 a piece. Super cheap considering the ones in the mall quoted me like $25+ to replace one battery. I was so impressed at how quick & nice the gentlemen was who works there.  He even added a diamond stud that had fallen out for free, so sweet. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Consider this a real salon.  A place that you would wear makeup and decent clothes to.  I showed up in my most unflattering work outfit and I was feeling a little more than uncomfortable. \n  \nThankfully, my stylist Mandy didn't prejudge me and was willing to take her time discussing my new cut and highlights.  She had lots of good ideas and I ended up with really good cut and some new blonde highlights.  I'd definitely go back to her. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not the worst Chinese I've had, but definitely not the best.  Good for a cheap lunch, but very Americanized selection.  Wait staff is friendly and attentive, the food was hot, buffet was fairly well maintained.  \n\nMore like fuel than food! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome family owned business for quality trophies, awards, and printed t-shirt at a reasonable price! The owners are friendly and very helpful. If you have questions or need help with picking out stuff, they will show you the best options for your budget. I had ordered some shirts from Thunderbird Trophies for my classmates and I for our graduation. We are very happy with them. The turn around was fast and got done right in time before my graduation week. Thanks Joey and Michelle! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Good looking talent and really good food specials will always bring the customers into this place. I will NOT return to this establishment again when in the area for business.\nThe cocktail/food service was the worst service in all of Phoenix. If management knew how much money that was not spent because of this lousy service, heads would most definitely roll.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Um, yum!  This place is a great spot for lunch if you work in the downtown, mid-town, uptown Phoenix area.\n\nI chose a hamburger and fries, even though I love gyros, but it was one of those days where a burger and fry were just needed for me to continue with my day.  \n\nThe environment is a large open area of basic tables and chairs, it looks like it gets really busy around lunch time so maybe not the best kept up dining room but people move through pretty quickly. \n\nThe menu is MASSIVE-- we are talking, they have pretty much anything to satisfy your hunger.  They even had a variety of low carb options which is a big menu choice these days.  ( i really need to get back to low carb)\n\nStaff is really nice.  We'll be back without a doubt. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I go through here if I get stuck on U.S. Airways but I actually don't mind connecting through here at all.  Even though there isn't a train/tram system to my knowledge, I never feel in a rush.  There are plenty of people movers/moving sidewalks so I am always able to get to my connecting gate w/o anything but a leisurely stroll.  Food options include Chili's, CPK, BK, and Cinnabon.  Despite being inside an airport, the pecan roll was one of the best I've ever had (just keeping it real).  If you Yelp while inside the airport itself there was a decent modern sushi, asian-fusion, independent IIRC but I can't remember the name.\n\nRestrooms were actually clean.  There are even some higher end boutique-ey stores like Costa etc. w/ a nice modern white uniform row storefront along the moving sidewalks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place for a party!  I had a party here last night and the banquet facilities are top notch.  We had several hors d'oevres the lamb lollipops were awesome and a must have when you have an event here.  The lobster rolls were not memorable and I'd suggest you skip these when choosing your items.  The crabmeat stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  I was very impressed with our entrees we had a filet and crabcake dinner.  I'm always a little scared with mass produced filets, but they were all cooked perfectly.  The crabcakes had almost no filler and were jumbo lump crabmeat.  Dante is the banquet manager and very accomodating.  I definitely suggest you select the symphony a and b room for your event.  That's on the second floor with a great view of the north shore and pnc park.  They are not flexible on the food and beverage minimums, but if your party is big enough (I had about 50) they will throw in a complimentary room and may even waive the fee for the coat check girl.   Drinks are reasonable priced and if you request certain types of liquor they will provide them for you.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The rooms have very comfortable beds and are spacious.  Make sure you request a room with a river view.  I also suggest not valeting.  It's $25 which is way too much for Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome chicago style pizza. Finally a great pizza place in Arizona. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place to experience home cooked style southern food. Yams are delicious along with salmon fish cakes and sweet potato cake for dessert <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just as others have said I would really give this place 2.5 stars.  However I leaned more towards 2 than 3.\n\nThe establishment is located inside the Hilton by the airport.\n\nI ordered the fried calamari which was over breaded and simply ok.  I also ordered a pint of Guinness.\n\nThere were only maybe 7-8 other ppl in the whole place yet when I finished my first pint i had to wait 10-min before I was asked if I wanted another.  And I was seated at the bar!!!\n\nSo food get's 2.5 stars, service gets 1.5 for an average of 2.\n\nI didn't have a rental car and didn't feel like cabbin it even tho other joints were only 2 miles away.  Not having to leave the hotel counts for a lot! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best pasta I've ever had!!\nService can't be better, super cozy, I'm always so comfortable there I end up staying two hours!\nEverything is so delicious, but I love their spicy pastas, tequila lime and chipotle are my favorite.\nAwesome!!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stopped in one night for something different. No one seated us or helped us as we arrived. After talking with the bartender, we were seated only to have no waitress. After waving over a waitress the service and the food was sub par. Nasty burgers overcooked. Drinks were ok, that is why they received a 1. Atmosphere was shady and the clientele was inexperienced. Would not return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A local friend who considers Dr. Bebko an extraordinarily good vet checked and was told Dr. Bebko did consult with other out of area vets and would be happy to do that with my vet on behalf of my very sick kitty, but the cat's records would need to be faxed to him. \n\nMy vet's office, here in Texas,  did so, and because the chest x-rays could only be sent via e-mail she called Dr. Bebko's office. She was told that Dr. Bebko did NO consultations regarding an animal he had not personally seen.  He added that she (my vet tech) was wasting his and her time, that Dr. Bebko would NOT be looking at the faxed information., and not to bother with the x-rays.  (Since my cat has a collapsed lung, records without x-rays are pretty useless.) \n\nWhen I reported this to my friend who had spoken so highly of Dr. Bebko, she called his office and was told the exact opposite...  Maybe the doctor IS good, but I'll never know because his office is either certifiably crazy or incredibly rude...maybe both. \n\n And, yes, of course there are feline specialists right here in Texas, but I wanted THIS particular doctor because of my friend's recommendation. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you have been to Trader Joe's before, you know the experience should be consistent EVERY SINGLE TIME you go. This particular TJ's was organized, the staff was friendly, their products were in line with the expectations that I would have for any TJ's. Their produce was fresh and I COULDN'T leave without getting some Cookie Butter - OH SNAP! \n\nTrader Joe's is definitely a cool place with a variety of options and when there is one close, I would definitely choose it over the \""mega supermarket\"" chains. \n\nOh yeah, and they are always willing to open something so you can try it out before you buy it... how cool is that! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I desperately needed some lunch and came on this gem. I had the Almond Chicken Salad sandwich on a fresh 7-grain bagette with corn & bean salad. The sandwich was amazing. I didn't really care for the salad, but that didn't taint my experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'll keep this one short - DO NOT GO HERE! We waited about 20 mins to get a beer and then another 1/2 hr to get our check. Asked a couple other waitresses to get our waitress, but she seemed busy elsewhere. Finally came with our checks when a couple of us made it seem like we were walking out without paying.\n\nAnd btw, Flying Saucer is right around the corner and MUCH better. Go there instead. Seriously. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What a waster of time and money!  My regular ophthalmologist recommended I see the same doctor who performed my previous cataract surgery (which was here) for a followup procedure.  Step 1:  Repeat the same exam I had just received from my ophthalmologist at a cost of about $200.  Step 2: Go in for an evaluation with the Surgeon ... wait in 3 different waiting rooms for over 2 hours, then leave, since I myself had appointments. Leave having accomplished nothing as I never saw the doctor!  At no point did they indicate to me it would be over an hour delay and offer to reschedule or give me any indication of actually how long the wait would be. Feels more like a surgery factory than health CARE.  I have no intention of coming back to this facility. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had a facial with Karen, say no more--it was divine... I bought a special from LivingSocial...and since I've always wanted to try it but was low on cash...it was a great time to try it.   Love it....love it...  I look and feel younger, my skin is glowing...a much need it facial.  The greeter was wonderful I will defenitively go back... Thanks Karen!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must, be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.\n\nI started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  \n\nNext visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.  So HIGHLY disappointed with my Pho experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  only a stupid, spoiled, new york shiksa such as myself would order something on the menu called a latke at a place like this (\""the boxty\"").  it was disgusting and didnt resemble any latke i have ever seen.  \n\nlucky me, i had about 4 bloody marys during the hour wait for my table so I was full anyway. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great date spot. We had the bruschetta and cheese with wine. It's a busy place but you're not easily distracted from who you're with. Staff is helpful with suggesting wines and it's $5 for a glass between 11a-5p. Not a bad deal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try.\n\nYikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best \""average\"", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars.\n\nI had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3\"" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!!\nI haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! \n\n My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! \n\nI hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned \""one\"" star. Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par. \n\nThere are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here. I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am a huge believer in bed & breakfasts, especially in the winter when you are bound to spend more time indoors.  This is a very cute one; bf and I stayed here on our visit to Madison.  Hosts were VERY friendly, so we started our (very big) breakfasts around 9 and usually ended around 10.  They were very accommodating and solicitous of our feedback.  \n\nWe stayed in the Mentor room, which was spacious and had a hot tub but no shower, so I used the shared shower across the hall since there weren't many guests during that weekend.  It really felt like we were staying at a friend's house, except I didn't need to help with the dishes.\n\nSome things that didn't bother me but might other people:\n1)  Note that they have two large dogs\n2)  If you're averse to flowered wallpaper, this is not the place for you. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't care for this place all that much. But my friends do, and I can see how uneducated normal folk get sucked into the \""Cheesecake Factory Vortex of Doom\"".\n\ni came here for a get together with friends the other night. The menus are a bit much with all that advertisements in them. The menu is eclectic, but I definitely think the prices are borderline gouging. \n\nThe portions are big, that is correct. But, chicken is cheap, and a plate of it with mash and gravy for $16 is a bit much. \n\nThe cheesecakes are delicious, all though we were a bit bummed to find out that the cheesecake is not made in house. My friends first choice was said to be unavailable because it was frozen. That means the place is not a Cheesecake Factory, but merely a Cheesecake Depot, where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies. \n\nI strongly feel this place is WAY overpriced for what it offered. It is a casual, family restaurant with upscale dining prices. If they had a better product, I could stand spending $60 for 2, but not when it's a sandwich and Chicken and Biscuits. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow ... They have a little of everything.   Great selection of imported items from the traditional ceramic pieces to extensive Day of the Dead items,   Lots of great metal work items for your patio or wall.\n\nThis is the place to take out of town guests to find those unique imported items <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My new fav!! :) We have to go down town about once a week, and we always end up eating bad food, but I wanted something healthy, and I noticed That's A Wrap. I ordered the Price of Thai or something like that on Monday and it was great. Both the Hubby and I were down town on Wednesday and we were starving, so we went back and he got the buffalo 66 and I got the Who's the Turkey, ooohhhh my gosh they were AWESOME! the buffalo 66 could cure my hardcore wing cravings and I have not stopped wanting another Who's the Turkey!

The ladies at the front desk simply sat and discussed their tailgating party the entire time and ignored my requests for an answer as to why it was taking over 75 minutes for us to be seen by the doctor. They were rude and condescending. I urge anyone seeking a professional, trustworthy ENT doctor to look elsewhere. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> T. Cook's is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  I've lived in SF, NYC, and LA, which is where I am from and currently reside.  I haven't had much luck in LA in terms of finding really good \""Western\"" food.  I love LA for its ethnic food. \n\nI've eaten at T. Cook's three times now since I'm staying at the Royal Palms Resort.  Tonight's dinner was OUTSTANDING.  I ordered the sea scallops with shrimp mac & cheese.  It was so good.  Even the accompaniments were delicious - the spinach and the corn kernels.  The corn kernels tasted like they were first soaked in vinegar so it was a nice surprise and really complemented the dish.  For dessert, I had the Napoleon.  It was so delicate.  The crisp was so thin on top of a chocolate mousse.  I loved it.\n\nMy mom had the \n\nI'm definitely coming back next time I'm in town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  REDO!\n\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \n\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \n\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\n\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We moved to Az last December and really miss our old Italian haunts back home so we saw this on DDD and thought we would give it a try. My wife and I both ordered the Capellini with meat ball and a basket of bread. The bread was really disappointing, we could get better bread at the bakery in any grocery store, definitely not Italian bread. The Capellini was so so, the meat sauce was very bland with no destinctive flavor of any kind, very disappointing. We are used to going to St. Louis and eating on the Hill section where the neighborhood is famous for great little Italian spots. Back home we had a nice little four star Italian spot called Paparazzi's, and no one has ever come even close to there quality and service, anyone ever visiting Peoria Illinois needs to try this place if they want top notch Italian food.  Our bill was $40 with tip, rather high for the quality of food, service and atmosphere we experienced. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish I could rate the facility higher but due to me experience with Dr. Perkins, I can only give them a 2-star rating.\n\nI have since filed a formal complaint to the Arizona Medical Board stating the following:\n\nOn February 7, 2014, I went in for a scheduled PRK Revision Surgery with Dr. Scott Perkins of Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center.  Dr. Perkins was unprofessional in the manner in which he spoke to me during the surgery prep and during surgery.  I have had this same procedure done October 4, 2013 so I am familiar with the process and the experience.  After Dr. Perkins put the numbing drops in my eyes, the next step was to place a sponge like object on my eye.  Unlike the time before, it was extremely painful causing me to squint and twitch in pain.  I said, \""It burns.  Why does it burn?  I know I should not feel this, I am concerned that I do considering you will be putting a laser on my eye next and I feel pain.\""  He exclaimed, \""Oh my god, you are so dramatic!  I have done 15 of these today and no one has been as dramatic as you!\""  I said, \""I am sorry but this is uncomfortable unlike last time, shouldn't you be just as concerned?\""  He then threw himself back in his chair and said, \""Are you done yet?\""  I could not believe the way that not only a doctor but a person was speaking to me.  He then proceeded and was unusually rough in the manner he completed the rest of the procedure.  Once Dr. Perkins was done, I sat up and was escorted to the post-op room where I was crying and beside myself in the experience and pain with Dr. Perkins.  I explained what had happened to the technician and proceeded to check out.  I not only experienced a tremendous amount of pain in comparison to the first procedure done by him but tremendous pain after.  It is my belief that Dr. Perkins did not allow the numbing drops enough time to take effect before proceeding nor did he have the care and concern for the matter.  I am disgusted by his unprofessionalism and the pain he put me through.  It has been 5 weeks since the procedure and it appears that my vision was affected by his poor quality work as my vision is worse now than it was 5 weeks after my first procedure and prior to this second procedure.  I do not believe this doctor should be practicing on such a delicate sense and lacks any compassion and bedside manner.\n\nIt really is such a shame to have dealt with Dr. Perkins because I have had a great experience leading up to surgery.  Dr. Schiff is the pre and post op doctor that has been such a pleasure to deal with.  He is very warm and informative just like the rest of his administrative staff.  After my experience that night, I received a call from their branch manager wanting to address the issue.  She stated she would send me a gift card as some type of consolation.  Three weeks later, nothing.  I sent her an email to verify the address she had for me and after no response a week later, I called her and she said that she sent it to me after we first spoke.  Yeah, maybe it got lost with her response to my email.  Another week, she receives a return on the mailing and realizes that she had the wrong address.  I get the $20 gift card with a note stating, \""Here is another gift card.\""  I was very offended.  She would have gotten a return on the first one since she sent it to the same wrong address IF she in fact did send it the first time.  I was initially impressed by the way K.D. tried to mitigate but then offended in the result.  This is a $4,000 procedure and I suffered a great deal of pain for a $20 gift card that required my constant follow-up.\n\nPlease note, I do recommend Dr. Schiff to inform and prep you for the surgery and his administrative staff, just please ensure you do not get scheduled for surgery with Dr. Perkins. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I live very close so I decided to have a light dinner and drinks before the salsa crowd was wheeled in.  I noprmally google a menu before my visit to have an idea of the cuisine.  I sat at the bar and ordered wine.  (stemless glasses, huge turn off, but there are trendsetters, and everyone else).  The actual menu was the menu online chopped in half. (There were only about 6 items on the actual menu).  I chose the shrimp skewers.  I was literally the only person at the bar outside the staff, that consisted of 5 20somethings eating humus and crackers and a 40something with a cheap french press dolling out samples to the others.  I was served the spicy shrimp and offered no water, or receptacle for said shrimp's tails.  Bad service!  I was LITERALLY THE ONLY PERSON at the bar.  My wine glass remained empty for at least 10 minutes before my server found a loll in her humus eating gabfest to see if the one customer may need something.  After I finished the second glass, I managed to flag down one of the all black outfitted staff who was still eating something with her finger as she went back behind the bar to ask for a check.  \nI've been to BOSSA NOVA many time before, and I understand the short service when a the bar is beyond capacity, but again, I was the only person at the bar.  There were some people seated at tables, but the bar, just me.  \nSo if you are looking for wannabe pretensious night club full of party goers that can't remember what going out looks like, than you've found it.  If you want, good food, good music, and a fun atmosphere, then run over the valet at bossa nova on your way to anywhere else! <|endoftext|>

This place looked dive-ish, but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables, but the drive-thru was buzzing. \n\nMy friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought. \n\nWe got back to my house, opened up the white wine, and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good, even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though. \n\nAll in all, not my dream dinner, but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night. <|endoftext|>

Even at 1:30 a.m., the place was packed, albeit with inebriated post-clubbers speaking at the same volume they did on the dance floor. The pizza was good and the prices were reasonable - we loved the little garlic bread balls. I didn't find the place dirty - the only thing that pained the eyes were the horrible ensembles worn by the patrons. Cocktail dresses should NOT be worn with flip-flops, ladies, and disco ball-inspired clothing IS as ridiculous as it sounds. <|endoftext|>

Nice place and I will go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could give Mimosa Grill \""0\"" stars, I would.  I made a reservation with Mimosa for my family's Thanksgiving meal in 2012.  I called a month in advance and inquired about the menu.  I was explained all the menu choices that would be available and with Mimosa Grill's reputation, decided to go forward with it.  When we arrived on Thanksgiving Day, the restaurant did not have a menu - it was a buffet.  Never was this mentioned during our 15 minute phone call when I made the reservation.  A lot of people do not like buffets - so this should be made clear!  Secondly, the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet.  This caused the restaurant to REEK of salmon and therefore every bite of food I took tasted like salmon (which I don't particularly like).  The rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy.  But, hey, at least I didn't gain weight over the holiday.  \n\nI believe when a restaurant serves a holiday meal, there is a special trust they must have with their customers.  We choose to trust the restaurant with our most treasured memories. Also, holidays are so booked, we can't leave and go to another restaurant!  Mimosa Grill blew it (although I am pretty sure we will look back at this and laugh).  We did call Zink's (where we ate last year and owned by the same company) to see if they could fit us in.  Unfortunately, Zink's had also chosen to go with a buffet this year (unlike last year)  and didn't have any tables available.  What a shame - I will definitely be more discriminating next holiday, and my sister is even entertaining the idea of cooking. <|endoftext|>

They get a negative star!\nI love a good DQ cone or blizzard just as much as the next person, but a complete failure was at hand on my first visit to this particular DQ. \nLet's just say....I watched a cook with a large beard and very long hair (both uncovered) toss a uncooked frozen chicken breast someone ordered directly on a dirty counter before putting it into their cooking machine (some sort of microwave)...ah ya.\n\nDo Not eat food here, unless you like the thrill of being poisoned. \n\nAs for the ice cream---I have never been to a DQ where I've been told they were out of a specific blizzard mix. \nI completely understand that having multiple 16 year old kids run the store might sound great in theory for cheap easy labor, but they are ruining the franchise and spending the owner's money as I watched them give away multiple items free to a group on their friends sitting at a table in the back.\n\nThis DQ does not even deserve 1 star.\n\nI read a review that said call the Health dept.....Seriously, someone call them! <|endoftext|>

I feel bad so I tip, as it's hot and I sure as hell ain't doing the job.\n\nGo somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This was our first  experience at the Waldhorn and, I must say, we were impressed. Our experience started with beers (of course) before dinner while we waited for our table. The bar staff was pleasant, welcoming, and quite efficient. The bar had 11 German beers on tap, ranging from Pilsner to Optimator, and several more in bottles. \n\nDespite the fact that it was restaurant week in Charlotte and the Waldhorn had an impressive Queen's Feast (4 courses), we decided to order from the regular menu. We started with the sausage sampler. Each sausage was delicious and presented beautifully with a dollop of sour kraut and a bit of mustard. \n\nFor our main courses, I had the rouladen and my wife had the sauerbraten.  Simply put, it was the best rouladen I have had in a restaurant. Tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Karen's sauerbraten was fork-tender and served in a light, but delicious, sauce. \n\nWe finished with the apple strudel and ice cream. Flakey and warm. A perfect way to end the evening. \n\nThe only real negative to our experience was the roaming accordion player. Don't get me wrong, he was a fine musician. However, the music was almost unbearably loud in such confined spaces. Conversation became a controlled shouting match while he was around. \nOverall, you should go there.  Just don't eat for a day or two prior to your visit. <|endoftext|>

For a restaurant in this price range I'd give it negative 3 stars. Waiter was extremely inattentive. We ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. Not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. Our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. This is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.\n\nFood flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. The preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.\n\nDesserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  It was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. Again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.\n\nI'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had TGIFriday's prices.\n\nConsidering the prices, I prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. I'll have to settle for 1.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.\n\nIf you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.  He make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly. I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy, brown hair, and awesome tattoos).    \n\nMany of my orders get messed up because SOME (not all) of the cashiers are busy talking to each other while my order is being taken.  I don't mind that but focus on the customers too.\n\nThe major complaint that I have with this location is when the high schools let out.  The tons of students from various of communities just hanging out, cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on the tables and often just sit at your table.  When Arby's and Wendy's use to be open next door, the management  of these establishments did not put up with this loitering or chaos.. <|endoftext|>

Through all of it, the staff has always been patient, pleasant and trustworthy. \n\nAs my boyfriend says about them, \""I don't mind paying a little more than the cheap-o shops to know that things will be done properly the first time.\"" \n\nAlso, something significant for me is their ability to provide a prioritized list of suggestions regarding what needs to be fixed on your car, what can wait and how \""dire\"" they each are. \n\nI'm incredibly impressed with their ability to do great work and also, somehow, make me feel happy about giving them my money to work on my car. :) \n\nDefinitely recommended! <|endoftext|>

This store lead me on a real journey through the heart, mind, soul, etc. I couldn't find anything but circuit city taught me the lesson of patience. For all those that give it a bad rating they wouldn't do that if they knew that the city went the extra mile to provide triple the size for the employee parking lot! the customer one is actually smaller and you can meet some really great friends there! 5 stars! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Kind of an odd experience eating here.  The menu is extremely limited, and the crepes are made of buckwheat, which is not a good thing.  Some of the ingredients are very good and very high quality, such as local artisan cheeses, while others are very low quality, such as rubbery eggplant and frozen fruit.  Everything was either really, really good or really, really bad.  For the prices they charge, I expect EVERYTHING to be really, really good, so I doubt I'll ever be back.\n\nService was fantastic, though our server was wearing a shirt cut so low that we could see the little bow on the front of her bra.  It was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere.  The portions are tiny, especially considering the prices.  I had a salad, entree, and dessert and would've left pretty hungry had I skipped the dessert.  \n\nSome of the food is quite enjoyable, and all of it would improve substantially if they used regular crepes instead of the buckwheat.  I really liked what I dub \""the world's smallest salad,\"" and I would've enjoyed it even more if the tiny little thing hadn't cost more than a full entree does at many other restaurants in town.  A lot of the food, including the crepes themselves, seem to be made ahead of time and warmed up instead of being made fresh.  I think a lot of dishes are microwaved based on the funky texture and uneven temperature, which was very off putting.  The peach crepe I got for dessert was warm and wonderful around the edges, but by the time I got to the middle of it the peaches were still frozen.  So, bad ingredients + bad microwaving = $7 dessert.  No thanks.\n\nBeer selection is good, but also very overpriced.  Overall, while some of the food was quite delicious, I feel like I didn't get enough of it for how expensive everything was, and some of it was pretty bad.  I think this might be a good place to go just for drinks and dessert or something, but as a dinner destination I wouldn't recommend it. <|endoftext|>

It was wrapped up in Saran wrap and put in a box when i opened it, the texture was dry and hard, and it wasn't big enough to charge almost $4...  there were flies everywhere. I won't be back anytime soon <|endoftext|>

Oh the deli men - they're hilarious.  I'd even say, their worth the trip out to the store, but you might want to know more about the food, glorious food. \n\nI shop at the Macaroni Company weekly.  They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.\n\nIn any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Looks like I'm on a roll with getting horrible service at what are usually pretty decent restaurants lately!  I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!\n\nCarter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')  \n\nThe next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.\n\nSo, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.\n\nSo, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.\n\nBottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it, even if they've never stepped foot in it. Pegasus was an amazing bar/club to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy, no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. \nService was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections. \nWe started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. \nI also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. \nDessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit). \nValet parking is complimentary; please tip your driver! <|endoftext|>

The renovated house turned cafe has a great atmosphere, which is perfect whether you are with your family, friends, or on a romantic date.   I prefer weekend brunch items (though they have changed hours lately so be sure to see if they are open first). I have ordered several things and have not been disappointed, though I will admit I have avoided the crabby benedict so no comment on that one.   Breakfast is filling, many of the items come with the rosemary potatoes and fresh fruit.  And Mimosas are $3. Sign me up!  Service is great and I look forward to going back again and exploring more of the menu. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this airport. The airport itself is very nice, with friendly staff and volunteers (look for the people in purple before TSA) to help you get where you are going. Pre security is pretty nice. Good selection of restaurants. Also, this has to be one of the few large airports in the US to offer free and reasonably fast Wi-Fi. I personally enjoy the speed and efficiency of this airport.\nFor those of you who say that the airport is in need of some new carpet: I agree. Those of you who think the layout is stupid: you are wrong. Airports aren't supposed to be a work of art. If you were to know a single thing about architecture, airport planning, and industrial design, you would realize that the way the airport is laid out is really efficient. You can quickly get to your terminal, and the E shape is so that airplanes can park on either side of the extending structures. Pre security is pretty nice.\nFor those of you who gave the airport itself a bad review because of an experience that you had with an airline, your review belongs on that airline's respective page. It is really misguiding when you rate an airport poorly because of a bad experience with an airline. You are supposed to rate and review the airport itself.  If you think this airport is bad, it must be the only airport in the world where you have spent a long delay or layover. Spend an 8 hour delay at JFK's terminal 2 or at O'Hare, and then we will talk. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is for Easytech that's inside Staples. \nDropped off my laptop to be diagnosed since it I was getting blue screen and error message related to the operating system. Informed technician that was getting OS message and tested computer. Came back after three alleged tests that said it was the DEFINITELY the motherboard. You know, in that know it all kinda way...\n\nAsked 2nd in house technician to test it again and once again came back and said it was motherboard. Offered to send it off to be refurbished for $369.99 and told me that they would do everything that was needed. \n\nCalled me back 2nd day to let me know that they couldn't refub. DEll XPS laptops with video cards and to get someone to replace the MB.  You'd thing that's something they would know. Ordered MB and had it installed by another technician  and it turned out to be the operating system.  Emailed technician regarding the inaccurate diagnosis and never received a reply. Morons. \n\nCertainly wouldn't assume just because they are working on computers that they know what they are talking about. \n\nGot me. <|endoftext|>

We really enjoy it here. If you've got a kid over one year old, I strongly suggest getting a membership. It'll keep you busy in spring and autumn. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had a good experience at this Fletchers. We brought our SUV in for a full inspection since we had just purchased it and it was used. We knew it had some issues due to it's age and wanted to ensure it was fit for driving. The person we got it from said he did all the oil changes himself regularly and maintained it the best he could.\nAfter the Fletchers inspection they did find that most of the regular maintenance items were in great shape as the previous owner had told us... so points for Fletchers for not trying to sell us something we didn't need. \nWe also noticed that the AC wasn't really as cold as we thought it should be... Fletchers suggested a minor repair and added dye to the AC for us to watch. He said if it starts to not blow cold again then bring it back and they would be able to find any leaks that appear. At the end of the day we did have a lengthly list of items that need to be repaired or that will need service soon... he suggested some items we could do ourselves over a weekend as well. \nSo yes, we had to invest into our car for some repairs but overall I feel they were honest about what we really needed, what we could wait on and what we could do ourselves. They also completed all the work in 2 days. He also found some specials for us and saved us about $100. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Breakfast is my favorite meal.  I love to go out and eat as much as i love to cook my own.  when eggs are cooked on a surface  that is too hot, they are done on the outside and undercooked on the inside.  \n\nI belong to a group that meets here every week, after last year, i stopped ordering the eggs because they can not prepare them medium.  so today i ventured out.  i asked out waitress how i should order the eggs if i want the whites cooked and the yolk soft.  she replied \""over medium\"" - perfect.  when my food arrived, i cut into my egg, as it ran all over my plate, the person sitting next to me asked how i could eat them so raw.  \n\nI simply pushed my plate away, finished the meeting, paid my bill.  I WILL NEVER ORDER FOOD at this place again.  when the kitchen doesnt care what it sends out, all dishes become scary.  I have been here every week for more than 5 years and it doesnt change. this was not an isolated incident. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been a customer of this store many, many times in the past.  I go there ONLY because they are the only source of yarn in the downtown area and I'm an avid knitter.  I put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this.  I was actually a little excited when they moved because I was looking forward to visiting a clean store.  \nHere is where my mistake happened.  I recommended them to a coworker.  She just called to ask where they had moved too (I was unsure of the address and it's not on their website or here on yelp).  When she asked the woman how ansered the phone if she could tell her where they moved the woman hesitated and said, yes I guess.  I'm sure she thought we was being funny.  Then she simply said they were located in the Gulf Tower.  When my coworker asked where that was the woman LAUGHED at her and said in a very rude tone, on Grant street.  My coworker has only lived in Pittsburgh for a year, as you all know PIttsburgh is not the easist city to learn.  When pressed for further information about the location the woman had the nerve to raise her tone of voice and tell my coworker that the building had only been there for 100 years!\nSad, very, very sad.  They are absolutly DESTROYING their reputation! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place and always stop here when I'm in the area. The smoked fish, sausages, and fresh made breads here are really awesome! Try the small smoked sausages on the deli counter, they are really good. I also love the smoked sturgeon and the excellent selection of salami they have here. The Russian salami is very good, if you like salami you need to try it. If you like pickles try the pickled tomatoes they have here. They also have a nice selection of caviar. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went here for a birthday expecting it to be good based on the reviews, the restaurant itself is nice but the food was terrible beyond belief. I got the steak from there and when I cut into it, it looked stringing, rough, and disgusting. I couldn't eat it. \nMy family was completely grossed out with their meals. When we went to tell the lady that our meals were terrible she was being sarcastic and very rude, in my opinion she has no respect for customers what so ever and for as nice as restaurant it is I will never go there again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've heard great things about the food but I was disappointed. We had a reservation, arrived on time but were not seated for 20 minutes. Service was friendly and knowledgable but it took forever to get our entrees - about 45 minutes AFTER our appetizer was finished and gone. I ordered Steak Oscar and I'm pretty sure they had grill running WAY too hot - my steak was crispified on the outside and rare on the inside. The desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. My first impression: overpriced and overrated. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Quite curt, if not rude, employees. Rep at the desk clearly didn't care that my reservation quoted a price a few dollars cheaper than I was billed. Tried to upsell me since I reserved the smallest car, though of course they didn't have any of the smallest so I got a bigger one no charge. Rep at the car return couldn't be bothered to hand me my receipt, just tossed it in the trunk and mumbled something as he walked away. \n\nTotally not worth the extra frequent flyer miles you get with Southwest for using Budget. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very nice grocery store indeed. Everything is well organized and not messy at all. The fruits were definately of decent quality, well it better for the cost. This is one of my top grocery store for sure. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The quality of the food is inconsistent. I used to love their falafel, but the last time I had it, it was so bitter it wasn't edible. The guy who works there seems very stressed and angry. He doesn't ever smile. The prices are good and when the food is good, it is decent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ugh... Or should I say: Eww...\n\nI was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight. I didn't want to eat at one of my usual spots and was feeling adventurous, so I just walked down Green St with the hope of finding something interesting. After a few blocks, I ended up passing by Basil Thai House, which I'd never noticed before.\n\nA quick look at the menu: it looks pretty standard. Prices are cheap ($7 entrees), but this isn't too unusual considering this is a college town. I find myself thinking: \""Eh, I like Thai food... how bad could it possibly be?\"" and walk in.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a rhetorical question turned out to be quite appropriate as the food, I found out, was... quite bad. I ordered the fried spring rolls, the basil chicken, and a Thai iced coffee. Pretty safe selection, one would think. The spring rolls were okay, I suppose, though really not that great. The problem was really with the basil chicken: it was honestly quite gross. First, why do they use ground chicken? That's just wrong. Ground chicken is wrong. As are most other types of ground meats, in my humble opinion, but chicken even more so. And the dish was just not good. I ate a little bit of it and was done. For the next half hour I had a gross taste in my mouth. Eww.\n\nLesson learned: even Thai food isn't always a safe choice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I wish you could give 0 out of 5 stars.  \nThis was one of my favorite bars... Loved coming here because it is the only gay \""spots bar\"" in the valley but will NOT return after the awful service we received.  \nAfter ordering drinks and reading the menu we noticed our server had left.  We waited for 15 mins before going up to the bar to request service.  \nSeems weird that he just left without saying anything, especially giving the fact we opened a tap\nI asked another server at the bar if he was taking over for our server. He replied \""yes, be there when I can\"".  After about 10 more minutes he came to our table.  He was pretty aggressive and it was very obvious he was not happy about having to serve our table.   He asked \""what do you guys want\"".  We ordered and after he asked how we would be paying. I told him we had a card already open.  At that point he just walked AWAY.  Didn't read our order back, didn't ask if we needed new drinks (my beer was completely empty), didn't thank us for ordering... he just walked away. \nHe continued to serve people around us.  He stopped to check his phone serval times but never came by to ask if we wanted more drinks.  \nWe waited for twenty minutes, our food never came and our server never returned.  I closed out with the bar tender, who seemed oblivious to what was going on and we left.  \nWill Never Return. <|endoftext|>

Strangely, they have a K-9 unit parked there many afternoons.  I can't say that matters much for most people, I just thought I'd mention it in case it matters to you.\n\nMany services are available at this branch, and most days there are 3-4 tellers are available, so even on busy days, the line moves quickly.  There is also an ATM in the outside vestibule and a drive-through ATM in the parking lot, so you have many options. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> falafel phoenix best falafel best phoenix best falafel phoenix best phoenix falafel phoenix falafel best phoenix best falafel\n\n6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!\n\nSeriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!\n\nIt really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of \""Magic Falafel\"" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.  \n     8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbt\nI can do box all by myself.\n\nVarious kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- \nthe menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. \nThey've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  \nYusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!\n\nPerusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of \""What the heck is THIS!?\"".  \n\nSpice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract!\nI'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.\n\nMy green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious.\nStill the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be \""Magic\"" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert? <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The big pro is the location in Campus Town. Most nights they also have food specials and the bar is usually very clean and service is fine. \n\nThe  big con is the food.

This seems like another place that hustles the students with little value for the money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Prior to writing my review for Primanti Bros., I put on my helmet, tooth guard, started my car and prepared to run away once the angry hordes of Pittsburghers read my review...Why you ask?   Get ready for it....deep breath...\n\nI...don't...like...Primantis...\n\nGasp!  Choke!  Faint!\n\nYes, yes, I know.  As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.\n\nI know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \""It's not that good.\"" and usually an apology afterward.\n\nSo there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I like the idea of Zoes, but they just don't really execute it properly. Everything is pretty bland, and I think their only flavor profile is Feta cheese. Don't get me wrong, I like Feta...but on everything? I've been there 3 times, always hoping for the best, but I always end up having to load everything with salt and pepper to even taste it. It's overpriced for just getting a simple sandwich on store bought bread with a bag of potato chips. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  so, yeah. stopped by for lunch today, had the teriyaki chicken salad. not quite sure how this was a salad - 5 strips of teriyaki chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce? ok, i'll concede that generally chinese food restaurants don't do salads well, but still. that was pathetic. chicken was fatty. sauce was flavorful. oh and my table had a funky plant/fake flower vase ... the green leaves were alive and in water, the fake flowers were mixed in with the live plant. weird. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me, the Original Fish Market fits that description.  I met my mom and dad here for a pre-concert (Bonnie Raitt) dinner and honestly I wish we'd gone someplace else.  \n\nTo be fair there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the food or service.  I've enjoyed seafood restaurants before and while my dinner was okay, it was only just \""okay\"".  There wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.  Nothing that made me say, \""Wow\""!  My parents didn't hate their dinners either but they weren't impressed.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.  The Original Fish Market wants to be a swanky hotel restaurant.  It certainly sets its prices high enough ($25.00-$45.00 per entree).  But the quality just doesn't match the price. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\n\nWhen I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.\n\nIt was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.\n\nThe door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.\n\nThe office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.\n\nI recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\n\nPoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere, service was fine, but our dinner was average to poor. The salad dressing was tasteless, the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy.  It tasted more steamed than hot grilled. The shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful.\nOur chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag? \nI guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good. \n\nWe are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga, but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste. <|endoftext|>

The room was not ready, the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians), the A/V equipment didn't work.   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broth...the owner came back with some excuse for this, but the issue was not corrected.  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Let's get right to it.  The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.\n\nThe Food - I ordered the fire dog, a cheese slider, and fried zucchini.\nThe firedog didn't let me down in the authenticity department.  Good meat, the correct and required condiments (neon relish, celery salt, sport peppers, tomato, mustard, onion. and seedy seed bun), cooked just right, and it smelled up the office when I opened it.  \nThe slider was the ex-factor.  I saw 'slider' and immediately thought White Castles.  But I didn't want to compare it to that, so I slapped my head to get the thought outta there.  Its a little burger with mustard, onions, and cheese.  What makes it special is the way the meat's taste melds with the onions, mustard and especially the bun.  Mine had a little too much mustard...and the bun wasn't a player on the field at all.  In fact, the sub-par bunnage took away from the slider.  BUT, I said I wouldn't compare it to Whitey One Bite's (White Castle's), so for what it is...ITS GOOOOOOD!  You will find yourself wishing you bought 2 or 82 more of them.\nThe zucchini was just filler for the car ride back to the job.  They were greasy and crunchy enough to get me excited at first...but their charm wore off after about 5 of them.  They are little chips of zucchini fried nice and crispy.  The taste of the batter just didn't do it for me, and the flavor of the  zucchini wasn't quite on point.  Doh, I REALLY hate saying anything negative about this place, because of....\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nYou know what kind of place you're in when you open the door.  A joint.  Pure joint.\nChicago newspaper clips, posters, political campaigns, pennants, whatever you can take from Chicago and stick on a wall.  This is the first time I've walked into a Chicago joint and was actually MOVED.  The place made me a little misty.  \nI miss Chicago.  \nThis joint made me remember some of my happier times as a kid, when life didn't suck.\nIts the kind of place you go and sit down with your team or with your buddies or with your kids or with your ma or with your worse enemy.  The SMELL OF GRILLED ONIONS makes everything just fine with the world.  Its the kind of place you go after you've just had some kind of fun, or even some kind of heartache.  Its just the kind of place you can go whenever, for whatever reason.  You feel like you belong here; like the world's bitter and evil hands can't reach you here.  You feel...safe.  Sorry to go off on that tangent, but its just something about the actual establishment itself...\nWho cares about what the floors look like, or what's in the corners?  Its a joint.  Its got joint floors and joint corners and joint tables and chairs.  Ain't nothing crawling.  Nuff' said.\n\nThe Service:\nAfter my nostalgic head-trip back to Chi-Town, I had to let the guy at the counter know they had done right by me.  Not much conversation due to the uncanny line that seemingly popped up out of nowhere behind me.  He told me that when I call in an order, \""Aw, you ain't gotta wait in line, just come on up.\""  That was almost the equivalent of him saying \""I love ya', man!\""  Without the awkwardness.  Oh, when I said I was picking up for 'Mike'...they all went \""Mike's here!  Got Mike here!  Get Mike's order!!!  Let's go!\""  Maybe its a routine, but it makes a guy feel like a million friggin bucks in a recession.  Let's just say I walked out of there feeling 10 times better than I did before I walked in.  And lastly, an elderly lady came in, and they all knew her name.  The guy immediately asked if she wanted something to drink.  I don't know...that just sat right with me.\n\nThe Value:\nOn.  The.  Money.  I kid you not, you got 5 bucks, you can eat...and good.  Get a couple sliders and fries for under 5 bucks.  Or one of the dogs and fries.  You're looking at a little more for an Italian Beef (which I intend to trek back there for), or something like that.  Money is an issue for most people, but you won't hurt yourself having lunch here twice a week.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nDespite the lack-luster experience with my zucchini and bun, I must say this:  Go here.  Go here often.  Smile when you get to the counter.  Tell them they have a nice place, even though they already know it.  Eat sliders.  Eat dogs.  Eat Frito Pie (and tell me how it was....while you stand a few feet away from me with that corn chip breath).  Sit down here.  Bring friends.  Bring people you don't know that much.  Bring people you don't like that much.  Just see how things turn out.  Your stomach and mouth will be happy.  Your heart will be happier, but perhaps out of a few years.  Write about it.  Talk about it.  Grab a few menus and stick 'em on the board at work.  \nThis place is all right.\nThis place is all right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Last month I tried to order a set of signs. Long story short I waited two weeks and many calls later I still never got a proof. Only excuses. Finally I told them to forget it.\n\nLast week I decided to give them a second try and replaced my order. I was told that I would have my proofs the next day. Three days later still no proofs. I called back, still no proofs. 4 days after my I should have had my proofs I called again, They then emailed me the proofs an hour later. The sign was all wrong. I started to make a list of corrections needed but when I reached 5 I gave up and walked away. \n\nI don't have any more time to waste on this company.\nJosh seemed nice but completely in over his head. Angela never seemed particularly pleasant and always seemed inconvenienced by my inquiries. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. If China Taste delivered I could easily see myself eating from here weekly.  This is a hole in the wall in a seedy neighborhood but I just can't get enough.\n\nThe Chinese food is some of the best I've had.  Typically get the Hunan Shrimp or Schezwan shrimp with a side of pork fried rice. The shrimp are big and taste fresh not frozen . large and cooked perfectly and the veggies are always crisp and not soggy and over done. Also we've had the sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken.  \nAlthough the restaurant is tiny and a little run down the food is very good.\nAll the entrees I've ever had were served pipping hot. \n\nThe restaurant is really nothing pretty and there are a total of 3 tables. The restaurant is tiny.  If you're passing through the Northside check this place out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  God this place is awful!!  Did it change hands between 1/19/09 when Matthew K. was there & 1/27/09 when I was there?\u00bf?\n\nThe sign on the side of the building says \""OPEN EAT\"" ...Straight forward & direct!  I liked that, so I tried it.\n\nInside & out, the place looks very old.  I would guess 1940s.  It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out.  There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign.  The second was the egg flower soup.  It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?).\n\nThe food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back.  The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah.  The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some \""hot tea\"", which was lukewarm.  Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both.  The whole deal was seriously terrible... the second worst restaurant I have ever eaten at, after Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, CA.  (Fortunately that place finally folded & this one needs to as well!)\n\n\""OPEN EAT somewhere else!\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just about now you are wondering are these reviews for real.well they are the food is first rate. It was just delicious. The brother and sister that run it are proud of their business and they have a right to be the food is first rate. They have been in the food business for 30 years and they care about what they do. They shop everyday themselves no deliveries because they are so particular about the food they serve. The place is super clean and they have an outstanding inspector rating. Best of all their 90 year old mother was still working taking pride in what she does not because she has to because she wants to. I am sorry we did not get here sooner, don't be sorry yourself go have some of their food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I used the ship to store feature on the website to get free shipping since the mall is really close to my house. It was quick and easy, and definitely better than trying to fight people for product in the store. \n\nI didn't quite understand where I could pick up my order, so since it was shoes I walked to that section to ask. The girl at the front was really friendly and she called up to the receiving department who brought down my shoes. I checked to see that 1. it was the correct shoe and 2. that they were the correct size. Both were true, so she printed me a receipt, and I signed that I received the merchandise, then I was on my way! \n\nVery pleasant experience and definitely worth it to save $8. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We tried to make a reservation for a party of seven and were told by Alecia that they could not accommodate us. She did not attempt to make alternate arrangements and was condescending in the process. We were extremely disappointed and will be taking our business elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Very RUDE management- we had to wait over an HOUR to get our car out of valet while we watched people leave left and right...we mentioned this to several people - we were offered many excuses to find out in the end that they completely misplaced our CAR! I would have been satisfied if they had offered us a drink- our table spent over $200 on our dinner- we didn't even get an apology...I wrote a letter and everything!\n\nThe waitstaff was friendly- the meal was ok - nothing special considering Charlotte has plenty of great restaurants . Restaurants have a lot to do with relationships- and they killed mine with this one.  Bottom line the food wasn't THAT good to warrant my return... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow! Talk about true to it's name - this place lives up to it!! Amazing. Maize. Maze.\n\nIt's located out in the middle of nowhere - but thats where you're suppose to get lost right?!?\n\nThe maze is huge!! They show you an overall map at the beginning and then give you a blank one with numbered squares. You have to go throughout the maze and find the numbered mailboxes, which inside, a square piece of the map that you are trying to put together to find your way out. You get a huge flag to carry through with you, so if you need help the staff can locate you quickly.  \n\nIt's fun for about an hour - then you become crazed and really just want to get out. The end was pretty challenging and it took us about an hour & a half to complete it - we did get all the numbered map squares/pieces. \n\n\n*Best tip about this place: Follow the water marks.... (They have jugs of water in the maze for when people get thirsty - they place them at specific locations where there are maze helpers who can answer questions and assist you in finding your way. Follow the water marks on the ground to wear they carried the coolers to and you'll find help) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Fast food.... NOT.\n\nBig corporate America places only get one shot w us. We came here cause we got stuff to do, quick trip to TARGET, try to get child fed quickly and to bed on time. SO LETS STOP AT Wendy's, right? Quick?\n\nSwing and miss. Never again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Tried this place for the first time because of a commercial I saw about their new stuffed quesadilla and it was awesome! Had the enchilada one, very tasty. The chicken was spectacular, the tortilla was fresh, the cheese was generous and they had some kind of cabbage in it that really brought all the flavors together very nicely! Only problem was the lobby was smokey. I understand that it was because they were in the process of making their awesome fresh grilled chicken, but it made my eyes watery and cough a little. But overall! It was very good! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you're hungry and looking for a good meal, do not come here. I cannot comprehend how their burgers were ever voted best in Champaign. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is solely about volunteering here. They do not return phone calls or emails. They treat people that want to volunteer their time horribly! On facebook former volunteers/vanguards are always complaining. Sojourner Center should start treating better those willing to work for free! This is a disgrace. The horror stories that i heard and my personal experience of not even treated as a person that should have emails returned is just unbelievable. Want to volunteer? Look elsewhere. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \n\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \""Italian\"" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.\n\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  On November 30 I took me car in for an oil change. The technician drained the oil, put on a new oil filter but forgot to put the oil back in it.  The engine seized up on the way home.  I called Chuck the assistant manager.  He sent a tow truck to bring the car back to the store.  My car didn't arrive back until 8:00 pm that evening.  I called the next morning.  I talked to the Manager Joey.  He said there was oil in the car...They put the oil back in the car after the engine seized up, and they are denying liability.  The tow truck driver confirmed, when he came to get the car, that he could not see any oil on the dip stick. An Inspection revealed that there was metal particles in the oil.  When I talked to Chuck and asked him what he saw when they removed the rod to inspect the crankshaft.  He said a lot of scaring.  After battling with the claims department for 29 days they finally offered my $1000.  That doesn't cover the cost of repairs to my car and now i have a bill for a rental car for $945.  I will NEVER use Firestone for any services ever again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've eaten here about once a month for the past 2 years, since my office is close by. The service is fast and friendly, and in two years, they've only screwed up my order once, which is pretty decent. It's a nice little family-owned establishment that caters to the downtown lunch crowd.\n\nThe food can be described as Americanized Greek, with a nice selection of salads and sandwiches. My recommendations: The hummus, the steak and mushroom sub w/fries or the chicken salad-stuffed avocados.  The food is fresh, fast and you can get lunch and a drink for under $10. Also decent: The Stacy Salad and the Chicken Souvlaki. When you order, be aware that they pile on the onions and the feta cheese unless you tell them otherwise.\n\nAthenian Express is located right along the light rail and within walking distance of ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. The building is plain, but clean, decorated with Chicago Cubs banners and usually CNN is playing on one of the three TVs. \n\nParking is limited and is available behind the restaurant. They do have outdoor seating and a clean restroom. Athenian Express also has a loyalty card program, but you have to ask for a card...Every 10th lunch is free!\n\nOverall, a positive experience for those who enjoy the simple things in life. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \""chicken\"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> They staff is awesome!  I can get my dogs in the same day if I need to.  They also offer doggie daycare and boarding.  My dogs love going there!  They an acre of grassy area for the dogs to run around in as well as letting the dogs roam around the office during office hours. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dude, this alleged 24 hour Dunkin' Donuts DOESN'T SELL DONUTS late nights!  Is it awesome to be really drunk in the middle of the night on saturday and go to get some donuts at the 24 hour dunkin' donuts, and it's OPEN but they DON'T HAVE DONUTS?  NO!!!!\n\nThe drive through is hella fast on weekday mornings, and the donuts are all always exactly like you'd expect from a dunkin' donuts (when they actually sell them.) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> YAY Mounds!!\nI've gone with my sister to get kitty litter and food here before and I really like this place! \nFor any Chicagoan's who may read this, it is similar to a Petco, but priced like a PetsMart. So they are rather pricey..\nMy favorite thing about this store was the Adoption Center. They have this great big glass window that you can see all the available kitties they have up for adoption. And they also have a board with pictures and descriptions of available dogs from the local shelters they can bring in. I know PetsMart offers this as well, but it is not nearly as big or clean. :)~ <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't stand this airport.  They put all of the feeder flights at the opposite end of the airport from the longer run flights making it a 1/2 to 3/4 mile jog.  The food court is the best part of this airport, the US Air clubs aren't bad either, free alcohol!\n\nThe US Air passenger service agents are complete jerks.  I can say that as I used to work for US AIr and actually tried to help people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This Fry's is just around the corner from my home. Unless I'm taking my husband's grandma shopping (who also lives right around the corner) here, I avoid this place at all possible! I much rather drive a couple miles to another Fry's. What really turns me off is the clientele and it just feels... dirty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stan's has great prices OUTSIDE mostly because they things they have prepacked are spoiled and moldy or will be tomorrow.  Inside is just average quality, equally average priced produce. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The fried chicken livers are so tender and good. The chicken is pretty good.\nThis place I need to visit more to try other things on the menu. The lemon cake was moist and tasty. I had inquired about it and when I got home there was a piece of lemon cake in my bag free of charge. The nice lady at the register was nice and friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They may have a lot of lamp shades, but they are THE RUDEST people I've ever met!\n\nThe lady with short hair has a crappy attitude, so does the younger guy. \n\nOh I'm sorry that i have a question!  what an inconvenience!\n\noh and did I mentioned they close at 5pm and turned the lights off on me at 4:30??!!!!\n\nSo rude! NEVER GOING BACK <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A year or two ago, Arizona Center was a destination for shoppers in need of Kokopeli socks or shot glasses blazoned with cacti. No more, no more! The kitschy tourist shops are gone, except for the flag store and the sports logo store. Most of the retail store fronts are simply empty.\n\nRestaurants are still around and range from pizza-by-the-slice through mediocre Mexican to kitschy family dining to high-end sit-down dining. If you're a conventioneer at a downtown hotel and want a walk and some palm-tree-infused atmosphere, you've got lots of dinner choices.\n\nThe major reason to come here, at this point, is that you live/work in or near downtown and want either (a) to see a movie or (b) to sit by a fountain and eat. Both of those functions are quite adequate and mean you took light rail or walked. DO NOT use the parking ramp. The few times I've tried it, I've ended up in a line of exiting cars with unreadable tickets. The parking system doesn't work, and it dumps you into some odd bit of \""turn this way only\"" lanes at the edge of downtown.\n\nIf it's tourist kitsch you need for pals back home, you're now stuck trekking to Old Town Scottsdale. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm, had little flavor, and a simple menu item that read differently from what was expected was not offered to be negotiated. From where I'm from, when something reads \""smoked turkey\"" you are expecting just that, not smoked turkey sausage (round slices of a turkey sausage). Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding, the manager (owerners daughter as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience. She was sarcastic & unprofessional. Sorry my family had THAT experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Decent food, incredible ambiance, nice wine flight.  Great place for a romantic dinner or happy hour if the weather is warm.  Dress up and impress your date! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have stayed here on multiple occasions, never a bad time. The staff is friendly,  the rooms and sheets are clean and there is free WiFi and of course, cable. Although this isn't a 4 star hotel, it's a place to sleep. Most rooms have a mini fridge with a microwave and you can always request it. No gym or pool but free continental breakfast daily is sufficient for me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Luke's! Originally, I was referred to them by my girlfriend's parents who swear by this place. I have had their Italian hot beef, their burgers, and hot dogs and I am always completely satisfied. A little greasy, but well worth the money! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For an in depth knowledge of the cultures, the arts and anything related to Native American history, this place provides all that and more.\n\nIt's $15 for admission and $7.50 for students. And there is free parking on their parking lot. They also have a cafe, a book store, and and a museum store too.\n\nThey have 2 full floors of artifacts, rugs, clothing and a section devoted to learning every different type of tribe in the south-western region of the continental United States.\n\nYou can definitely spend a couple of hours here and be immersed on anything and everything related to Native American art and culture. There are a lot of \""hands on\"" exhibits as well so you can learn stuff by touch it.\n\nDozens of paintings, head masks, a whole room devoted to doll collection and much much more can be found here. They also show the transition of how the Native Americans became \""civilized\"" by forcing them into schools and acting properly in the general population.\n\nOther favorites include the rugs room where all the rugs were pretty much made by hand and they all looked pretty neat.\n\nThey have museum store as well where a lot of the stuff made by Native Americans can be sold here. Although most items are pretty expensive. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I can't begin to say how many problems we had with this company.  First we have to say our sales person was pretty worthless.  He dropped his camera on his first visit out so he didn't have accurate pictures of our pool area which made the plans inaccurate.  We then made arrangements on the sails and placement based on what we were told by the sales person.  The installers came out when we were not home to put up the brackets and much to my dismay, left a large bolt laying out where my toddlers could choke on it.  They also changed our radio which meant they felt they could touch our stuff.  The most disturbing thing was that we were no longer to locate our son's dump truck that he carefully parked on the porch.  After circling the yard many times over with him at my heels I called the sales person who seemed appropriately concerned.  Again after looking I found the truck tucked behind a box right by the gate to exit our yard.  It was obvious someone either was considering stealing it at some point.  I was livid at this point.  The sales person became dismissive and we demanded to talk to the owner.  After quite a few days he called and was somewhat helpful.  We demanded that the sales person accompany the installers which he attempted to get out of.  The next problem was that after the shades were installed our deep end of the pool was shaded but not the shallow end which was our express reason for putting the sails up in the first place.  The sales person came out and came up with some ideas but proved to be pretty incompetent.  So when they moved the shade they had to cut some of the fabric off but still wanted to charge us for the fabric they didn't use.  Since the fabric is the most expensive part of the shade, we were quite upset about this.  After they finished installing the shade, the sales person asked repeatedly for payment without reconciling the cost.  This took multiple emails and calls to the sales person before it was finally resolved.  The only other compliant I had was that the sails sag, which we were guaranteed not to.  Hopefully this will be corrected.   I would not recommend this company. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'd prob give Soba 3.5 stars if I could. We didn't want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before (we prob won't get away with that on a non-stormy night). After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark, cozy and seductive venue. We were led up to the top level and settled in. I ordered a Sapporo, calamari and tuna. Beer always hits the spot for me. Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime. The tuna was tender! My butter knife cut into it so easily. The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me. Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out. We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress. The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered. Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have seen several shows here over the years. Most recently, I saw wicked, which was amazing!!! The one thing I really have to applaud about the Benedum is that the seats are all pretty good. I am on the shorter side and have never had trouble seeing, no matter where I was seated. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I like Merc for the dark, sexy, loungy atmosphere. I think its perfect for small groups to share a cheese platter and a bottle of Champagne. And when the music is hot....its hot! \n\nDisclaimer if you've never been: it's situated across the corridor from Houstons (Camelback)  and I think the sign above the door merely says \""Bar\"" or \""Lounge\"". \n\nEnjoy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome. I went here with my boyfriend on our 2 year anniversary and we totally spoiled ourselves. The food was interesting, nicely presented, perfectly portioned and delicious! We had the chef's tasting menu and I'm so happy we did. There were things that the waitress brought out that I would have never thought to order but ended up loving more than the others. I'd definitely recommend this place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is a low-key hideaway with friendly staff. I would not really call it a dive; it's more neighborhood bar. Watching live music here is a really up close and personal experience. They support local live music. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This particular location is pretty hit or miss. I am still nostalgic about the old location on Woodlawn and the quality of the food. Just isn't the same, maybe they sold? The penne pasta with Italian sausage is the only thing I'll order if I go. I've taken a bet on some of my old favorites and have been really disappointed. Price is kind of high for the quality of food you get. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went with family who go here on a regular basis and were underwhelmed. While I see the appeal of the all you can eat Happy Hour, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired.  If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.\n\nWe wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really wish the mic didn't have a mute button because the guy taking our order was cussing at customers in the drive through... If you don't like your job, find another one. Awful customer service and crappy ice cream. Oh and a tip for the employees based on my experience and all the bad reviews I've read (obviously isn't a problem just tonight) try smiling once and a while or treat people with respect. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One star. It's only because they won't let me give it zero stars. Read this carefully, if you book your room through a third party, such as Orbitz, they do not guarantee the room that you booked online. Traveled with my brother and booked a two double bed room and when we arrived all they had were rooms with a single king bed. Was told by the front desk I could get a roll away bed brought into the room at an extra charge of $10 a night if they had any available. Didn't matter whether they had any available or not because I had no intention of giving this place any more of my money. I travel often and I mean i travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever had this happen to me. I have stayed in nicer hotels at cheaper prices and haven't dealt with this kind of problem ever. Needless to say I have crossed all Hilton hotels off my traveling list. Also, room was tiny, small fridge, breakfast was not free where as in most places I stay it's complimentary. Bath tub floor was slick, tried to be careful didn't matter because I busted my you know what in the shower. Just an all around poor experience and I will not be back. One last thing, you hear everything that happens in the hallways no matter what's going on and that sucks when you are trying to sleep. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Brought some cds in to sell.  Got a little more than I expected, and they took a couple things I wasn't sure anyone but me liked (Vanessa Mae, some jazz; but I guess most of my friends are indie rock people).  Lots of stuff, great selection of vinyl.  I liked the tape collection, and might be back to get some tapes for my '99 subaru.  :)  Also sells DVDs/movies etc. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  i had the same experience as Dana B below.  Loved the ambiance, bartenders, music.  i was unfortunate to sit next to the lady who owned the place at the bar.  i was in town on vacation and she told me i was sketchy bc i had a camera with me and she didnt believe anything i said.  i could barely understand her rude statements she was slurring so much.  when she started cussing, i just said goodnight and walked out quickly  (left a half full jack and coke on the bar).  its not fair to rate the place terribly bc the place is awesome outside of the drunken owner, but i would never go back.  just steer clear of any old lady who tries to talk to you whos slurring. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I loved DQ as a kid and practically lived there as a teenager.  Fast forward many years and I am now rediscovering the joy of their soft serve.  I am an ice cream fiend and DQ's vanilla cones just seem to hit the spot these days.  Something about the cold, creamy goodness is deeply satisfying, and is rivaled only by their chocolate sundae.  This location has been here forever and has been upgraded.  The staff is very polite and the drive-thru is usually busy.  Most times this deliciousness is worth the wait! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really, really, really, ridiculously good pupusas.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why does this place always smell bad? Seriously, the second you walk through the door it's vaguely sewer-ish. Their roof deck is okay, and I am honestly glad that not every establishment in Lebo is high-end, but overall I'm not a fan. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Drug dealers hanging around the dumpsters, cars of people parked waiting for their connections, Broken security gates, Pool heater broken longer than the gates have been not working, Palm trees not trimmed, paint falling off the stair rails, Manager who rents to all types of trash.\nThese are only some of the problems associated with Paridise Foothills apt. This place is running down fast, the pools need to be re done, cool deck thats now hot deck. slimy landscaping,  Pool heater broken and the list goes on...\nLaundry room is very run down and over  120 degrees in the summer, of course they lock the doors to keep the run down laundry room safe.\nEven the fountain out by the mail boxes is broken at the top. \nThe low life owner must be turning this place into Section 8 HUD or something is very wrong here!\nIm very happy my lease is up and I can get away from this run down dump.\nPlease dont rent here unless you are a drug dealer and you must supply your own \nHOODIE! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I received my BA some time ago and was poised and ready to go to grad school to pursue a career in academia, either Literature or Creative Writing, but then life happened and fast forward seven years and I had a ton of work experience and traveled abroad but was still missing something in professional life.  So I started hunting for jobs and kept running into the same problem--all of them required an MBA.\n\nNowadays, an MBA is what a BA was 10-20 years ago.  It's kind of the standard now.  To even be considered, you have to have this degree, so then I set out about finding a place that wouldn't only give me classes but give me the intangibles that set exceptional people apart from the rest.\n\nSo I looked at Wake Forest, and I looked at UNCC, and I looked at Chapel Hill and found the same trend--they showed me all the bells and whistles of their program (the updated technology, the facts and figures about success rates, the name dropping you could do), but none of those programs really had substance.  I'd take some classes, learn enough to get good grades, and I'm done.\n\nWhen I visited Queens, not only did Dean Shiffler present the school in a positive light (which is expected), one of the current students did.  Unsolicited.  I was walking around the grounds, struck up a conversation, they were in the program I was interested in, and he gave me the run-down.  It was an honest assessment, and that meant more to me than anything else.\n\nI'm in my second year now in the PMBA program, and I'll tell you this--I will never regret this decision.  I still have a ways to go, but I've learned more than just finance and stocks and bonds and amortization and cost/benefit analyses and all the other information you'll learn in an MBA program.  I've learned about myself.  I've discovered that my vision for my professional path was almost non-existent and I was at a point in my life where I was going nowhere fast.  They truly invest in you here.  It's a small school, which is just what you need.  It's competitive, but rewarding.  Students really build a community here.  You're not just a number--professors remember you by name (or at least face), they're accessible, they listen, and most importantly, they approach their jobs as a person first, and a \""Dr\"" second.  \n\nI'd be willing to speak to anyone about the PMBA program at Queens; I have learned some invaluable lessons already as a result.  Aside from the beautiful campus, you get a sense of belonging here--Southern charm at it's best.  I'm really proud to be a (graduate) Royal, and you should definitely consider Queens. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In my opinion, the is a prime example of a bad Shadyside bar. It's right on Walnut, too small, always too crowded, and I feel like I'm a 21-yr old college student when I go out there. It's miserable to be there on the weekend when it's so crowded because it's such a small space. The only reason I'm giving this bar 2 instead of 1 star is because the karaoke on Fridays (if you can handle the people and the crowd) is pretty good- although there are half a dozen better places to karaoke in Pittsburgh. Furthermore, I have sat on the patio table for a nice chill happy hour once watching the craziness of Walnut Street happen in front of me- which was oddly relaxing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \""the list\"".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The owners are very nice. They've been here for over 10 years. The shop is clean and they can always get me in without an appointment. They do good work and they always remember me even after years. The only thing I wish is that they would remove more of the dry rough skin on the heals. I still have to do it myself at home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went on Monday to go to a Karaoke bar, but there wasn't any Karaoke going on, there website says it goes on every night. It took 10 years for anyone to take my order, and when I asked what was good to eat I got a, It's all good, response. How does that make it easy to decide what to order? Then I spent another few hours waiting for the check. The food was good, but it's just like any other food. Nothing special about it. I really felt like an outsider coming to this place. Not very welcoming. Maybe I should have gone on a busier night when the staff actually would want to work. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pretty bad when you order your food,  it  never shows up and they wont answer your calls.   We drive down and they say they never even started our order.   Stay away,  Chinese food is not rocket science,  this establishment is awful.\n\nLet's call it \""No No China\""  as you won't ever get your food. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'd rate this joint 10 million stars if I could. Best ice cream in PGH!!! They serve sundaes, milkshakes, and the old school cherry dip cones.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Easily the best garage in Chambana. I went to Midas in Champaign and was told my car was in serious danger because the brakes we are less than 10% pads. I was also told my left front strut was blown (this was true). The quote was 850 for the brakes and caliper service and 1050 for the struts as they have to replace both (also true). I told them I simply couldn't afford it and instantly the offer for their overpriced credit was made.\n\nI left and decided to try my hand at a local garage. Long's did not disappoint. I was seen immediately and given a cost of almost half what Midas quoted for the strut and then told that my pads had 50% left and calipers were fine and could easily and safely drive for quite some time on them. They offered me rides to and from my home and found ways to discount and save parts like the strut strike plate and charge less for labor. Rudy, who I did my service with, was given a handshake and the promise that I now have my permanent mechanic: Long's Garage\n\nPLEASE bring your car in to Long's! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to love them, then they sent me a pair of dull shears.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My appointment was for glasses.  I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\n\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \n\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\n\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\n\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.  This experience has been so horrendous and I hate my glasses so much that I am seriously considering lasik surgery so that I never have to wear glasses again or have to deal with the hassle of getting cheated on a pair of glasses in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow, El Bravo never disappoints! My first visit to El Bravo was 15+ years ago and I have kept coming back because it seems to get better every time. I developed a high bar for judging Mexican food while growing up in Phoenix -- probably because of El Bravo!\n\nMy favorites are either the traditional combo plates (some variation of tacos + enchiladas + tamales) or the Machaca plate. Great family place!\n\nSpecial shout-out to the tamales: El Bravo makes over 700 dozen tamales around the holidays; they don't make them until ordered, so it's fair to say that demand is *very* high for these delicious fares!\n\nViva El Bravo! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm with others here - not a lover of Primanti Bros.  Sandwiches are fine (I have ordered the turkey and cheese) but the service is horrible.  Rude, arrogant, and just nasty.  Plus when is the last time a broom has been taken to the floors?  (I'm reviewing the Monroeville one here). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You have to look past the appearance to have a great experience here. You won't find a lot of  frills and stereo typical sit down restaurant decor, but man do they have something more important, FLAVOR!  I used to think that an uptown diner had the best fried chicken in town but, i was mistaken. I got a two piece white with two sides. The chicken breasts where ridiculously juicy  The mac and cheese reminded me of the extra fattening goodness that only someone that learned a recipe that has stood the test of time. \n\nThey have fried everything and I love it.  If you want something good off the grid then stop by the chicken box and enjoy the south at its best. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really really wanted to love this place.  It comes highly recommended by so many people here on yelp plus it is located in a great spot.   I liked Dr Ryan right away on our first visit.  I was hesitant about her because she is so young but she won me over by the end of our visit.  I decided the 30 minute wait must have been just an emergency issue and chalked it off.  \n\nToday was my second visit when I brought our other dog in for his shots.\nI had requested Dr Ryan because she had been so good the first time.  When I had to change our appointment a week out I decided to wait a few days longer just so we could get her.  Well, again I was tapping my toes in the exam room.  This time for almost an hour.  I finally told them I had to leave and the staff offered me Dr Dutton who came in right away and gave  the shots.  \n\nMost places, would give you a break on the visit fee or write it off after making you wait almost an hour.  Not them.  Full price.  The fact that people work hard to get to their appointments on time seems to escape some establishments.  Blue Cross is apparently one of them.  Only one person stuck their head in to say she was running late.  Other than that I could have been running a prostitution ring out of that room and no one would have noticed.\n\nSorry Blue Cross...burn me once shame on you...burn me twice and shame on me.  I won't be returning.  You have nice vets but there are lots of good vets in the valley that will actually value my time and business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Want to feel like you're in a small town?  Come here.  Why?  Because there is such an amazing sence of community here.  Sit up at the counter, try a slice of one of Peggy's famous homade pies and chat with the waitress.  She's better than any bartender.  Or better yet, bring some family or friends and sit down at one of the tables and order some real food.  Real food because it's all homemade.  From the biscuits to the chicken fried steak to the smothered chicken to the meatloaf or some real get you going breakfast food.  From scratch food at practically fast food prices.  It's insane. \n\nThe waitresses are amazing.  Our 3rd time there we had the same waitress we had the 1st time.  She remembered our order - including a special request for gravy on the side.  Before we said it.  And it had been weeks since she saw us.  We decided it was kinda freaky - but amazingly cool at the same time. They are all amazingly nice in a down home kind of way.  Ya might get called hun.  Or sweetie.  I've seen regulars get their hair scruffled.  \n\nOne time we were there I saw the wait staff pull out the white pages to try to find the phone number for one of their regulars.  They were concerned that they hadn't seen him yet that week.  They found out he was sick, and one of the women said she'd bring him some food on her way home.  Right there and then - they had my business.  I may not live in the area anymore, but we try to make it over there at least a few times a year.  Who wouldn't want to support service like that?\n\nWhen you go - be aware of their hours.  These are small town too.  \nM-F 5am-9pm\nSaturday - 5am-3pm\nSunday 6am-3pm <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Quick review: very large menu, offers all you can eat fish fry, unusual layout. Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nAfter taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is \""around the corner\"" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section \""in front\"" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on \""the other side\"" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.\n\nOur waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.\n\nOur drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.\n\nWe were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \n\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \""off\""; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\n\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \""from the freezer bag\"" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\n\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \n\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \""lifeless.\""  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\n\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\n\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.\n\nTully's = fail.\n\nService = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)\nFood = 2 stars (based on fish only)\nValue = 2 stars\nMisc = 2 stars (not real exciting)\n\nI'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is where I take my car when I need a real mechanic (I *so* do not qualify) that does honest work for a reasonable price.  \n\nThey guys there have been unfailingly cool, honest, and affordable but it's also good to know that you're less likely to get screwed here than at a locallly-owned or non-chain joint because they have a corporate structure to complain to if need be.  But like I said, this is unlikely.  Find value, fo real tho! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had high hopes for The Eggery. \n\nNot because I thought it had potential or was even that hungry.\n\nFor me, the notion of an egg-themed restaurant sounded like the result of  insanity. The kind of mad science you see in comic books and Discovery Channel shows about hunting ghosts. \n\nMy brain had conceived this idea of an egg-obsessed madman, ceaselessly forging egg-based delights so that he may share his much-too-specific love of eggs with the world.\n\nUnfortunately for me and my imagination, The Eggery is not insane like Bizarro or Dr. Weird. \n\nNo, it's a \""Kevin Costner movie\"" kind of crazy.\n\nThe menus look like they haven't been changed or updated since the 80's. Which would normally be refreshingly retro, except the 80's weren't necessarily a good decade for eggs. Come to think of it, I don't think eggs and time travel are compatible. \n\nThe omelettes look more like accidents than exquisitely prepared dishes. \n\n\""You got chopped up ingredients in my eggs!\""\n\""You got eggs in my chopped up ingredients!\""\n\""...are you thinking what I'm thinking?\""\n\nThe Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you. \n\n\""Hahaha, you could've gotten this same dish at Hometown Buffet, and it would've tasted better, too!\""\n\nThe Eggery has no means of separating their pancakes from their competitors so they just make them bigger. \n\nIf you can help it, avoid ordering the sausage.\n\nIn fact, if it's not made of eggs, don't bother. They won't make it right.\n\nYour sausage will be overcooked, your hashbrowns will be burnt, and your coffee will taste like they used the toilet water. And the carafe of coffee they give you is usually only half-filled.\n\nAnd don't bother complaining to the manager. After all, he's probably the genius who assembled this crack team of apathetic, inattentive doppelgangers posing as a wait staff. Dude probably doesn't even know what eggs Benedict is supposed to look like.\n\nFuck this. I'm going to Denny's. <|endoftext|>

Well, if I'm ever stupid enough to get married again--or meet that man of my dreams with tons of money and severe pains up his left arm--I'm heading off to the Wrigley Mansion to do it in.  What a gorgeous place it is!\nFirst off, we had appetizers, which mean 3 different sliders of regular McDonalds hamburger size to eat for half price (since it was happy hour) = $7!  What a STEAL!  One was chicken cordon bleu, one was pork and one was something close to kobe beef.  Regardless, all were just superior in taste.  Downed it with a half-price (happy hour, again, folks) cocktail and, well, what a deal it was!\nMoving on, had dinner--some chicken thing that I will never be able to duplicate at home (and I'm a good, creative cook myself)--that was just delicious!  Everything, in fact, was wonderful--including our servers who were warm and friendly and prompt.\nI love this place!  I love this place!  I love this place!  Now all I have to do is find some half-dying old fart to marry.  Wish me luck.... <|endoftext|>

While earthlink gave me the introductory rate, TWC who services the account, was unable or unwilling to honor it. I think I have spoken by now to 21 representatives, spend a good 5 hours on the phone, lost Internet three times because TWC turned it off; and still got overcharged by $40. They say they have it fixed now. I am not holding my breath here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I want to start out this review by saying - I am never going back to Moto. \n\nI went there one time with a group. I was excited to try a new sushi place and normally really love sushi. However, there was a really bad odor when I walked in so I opted against trying the fish there out of fear of food poisoning. I can't comment on how the sushi is at Moto. Instead, I decided to try the Pho. I have eaten Pho at many places around town and typically enjoy it. Not at Moto. The broth was a darker color than I am used to and had a funny after taste. I couldn't even get through about 1/4 of it before I lost my appetite. \n\nMost of the other members of my group didn't like the food much either. My advice is that there are too many other places near Moto for good sushi and pho to risk trying this place. <|endoftext|>

I asked the front nurse for some tips on preventing an infection I keep dealing with and she just looked at me blank and said she didn't know. I'm sorry but you're a nurse, how the hell do you work here and not have ANY advice to give me? Thank goodness the doctors and nurses in the back know what's going on. In fact they're some of the nicest I've worked with. Definitely go here if you need to, they're some of the most hospitable and friendly doctors who go above and beyond the call of duty to help. <|endoftext|>

I'll update this review once they open back up. This is informational only. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Overrated! Service was terrible and food was below average. Tables were dirty and server refused to get cucumbers from the sushi bar, even we offered to pay for them. I offered the Gomoku Yaki Udon - pork was overcooked and overrun with whole calamari that still had eyes... Interesting decorating - Asian, Italian, and French with Christmas lights. Disappointed... :/ <|endoftext|>

Mexico produces more than just junk so they really need to bring some better quality stuff in!. I felt the prices were high and it was difficult to get around the place. The guys working there were nice but they just need to find some more quality. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Read review prior but my aunt wanted to eat so figured they may have improved since last reviews. Nope. Hot and Sour soup was bland. Crispy noodles were stale. My Sa Cha \""spicy\"" dish was missing the spice and broccoli in dish was visibly old. Should have followed my Yelp-stincts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very nice place!  Recommended as a good date night place by a coworker. Our bill plus 3 drinks was about $87 including tip. They accept reservations and offer valet parking. The wait staff was very friendly.  Our waiter suggested a few nice bars in the area - which we appreciated because we are not familiar with the Charlotte area. \n\nWe enjoyed the food and the ambiance.  My wife ordered the blackened chicken and she thought it was great...great flavor and juicy.  The portions were perfect.  We also enjoyed their pecan pie and key lime pie...both quite tasty. \n\nThe meal was excellent the server was excellent also!  \n\nWe will definitely visit again... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Haven't been to a best buy in years because I always had poor customer service. Today was sadly no different. The store was mostly empty and there were plenty of employees around, but nobody came by and offered to help us find what we were looking for while we wondered aisle to aisle. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Been going to this general physician for about 1 1/2 years.  I have never been seen on time, average is 30 minutes to an hour before I get called in, then another 15 minutes at least waiting for the doctor.  Assume you will need to plan an extra hour at least when going in.\n\nPrescription refills are slow.  When walgreens calls in the refill, the doctors office doesn't respond - I've had to follow up each time.  When I call the doctors office to check the refill status they say \""have you seen the doctor recently\"" ... what??  Obviously I saw the doctor which is why the first prescription (that was only for 30 days) was issued by him and also the refill is pending his approval.  Then they say \""oh - I will have to pull your chart and call you back\""... what is going on with this place?  Why does it take my call to get them to process the refill?\n\nFortunately I am moving so I will search for a new doctors office.   I think office take on too many patients, and too few assistants handling many doctors at a time.  Either insurance isn't paying enough so they take on too many patients, or they are too cheap to hire more help.\n\nDoctor Davies is very friendly however, and he does not push prescriptions on you.  I do like the doctor, but I cannot take the process of working with the office.\n\nGood luck if you decide to go with them.  I'm sure all the doctors are fine...that's really all that should matter... but I just can't take the hassle of their slow office. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We went up to Phoenix for a Tom Petty concert last year and were excited to check this place out.  I absolutely loved it!  I love old hotels like this and this one was great.  Rooms are small due to the fact that this hotel is old but still comfy and cozy.  The staff was very friendly and breakfast was very good.  The hotel was within walking distance of a few bars we visited and it turned out to be a good trip even though our concert was cancelled.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they lost our reservation on the first night we were supposed to stay BUT then they paid for a night at the Mariott around the corner.  Great customer service!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite place for Mexican food. Not familiar with Mexican food from Mexico, but this food is the closest to authentic as my Tia's. Prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly and I like the inviting atmosphere. It can get full, but we have never had to wait long at all.\n\nThis year our family had Juan's cater my Tia's funeral services on a Saturday. Some family could not make it in to town until Sunday, so we had to cancel the order, the restaurant is closed on Sundays. We informed the owner of our reason for canceling and apologized. The owner took time out of his Sunday to cater my Tia's funeral services. We cannot thank him enough for going out of his way to do this for our family...and everyone loved the food! Many Thanks!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix, and I've been to Thailand several times. Spice level \""hOt\"" is just right. My nose is running :-) Green curry has great crunchy veggies, Thai tea is nice and lunch specials are under $10. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  LOUD!\n\nWhen someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place, so everything is pretty cramped together. \n\nService is quick, genuine, and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....\n\nHad the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place isn't much to look at, but when the I'm talking about a restaurant ambiance falls second to good food. The pho here is great. Really flavorful with a great balance of ingredients. I need to go back and try the Bun. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've decided to try this place since I've been going to Arai Pastry in Tempe for a while and wanted to try something new.  There were many selections but honestly, I'm gonna stick with Arai Pastry from now on...here is why:\n\n*First of all, this is not a Japanese bakery - I'm making this clear because even though there are similarities, Japanese and Chinese baked goods are most of the time, different.  \n\n*Less than so so decor - It is understood that the decor of the store has nothing to do with the quality of the baked goods.  However,  since I already know a place that is much cleaner, cuter and with polite service, I can't help but to see it as a negative.\n\n*So so service - There were no labels on each pastry trays so I asked the store lady to tell me what was inside some of them.  All I saw was annoyance from her....maybe she was just in bad mood....I have no idea.\n\n*I tried the following:\n-French horn - if you want a good one, please try the one at Lee's Sandwich\n-Custard cream bread - honestly, after a bite, we had to through it away...if you like custard cream bread, try the one at Arai Pastry <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A friend and I stopped here today for lunch. I for some reason thought it was an odd choice, but he seems to go often and enjoys it. In fact the woman taking the order said to him, no drive through today? It would looks as though he is known in the whataburger world. \n\nThe people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected. I ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. I opted for the Hi-C. I do not like sloppy food and this burger would not have been if the bun had held up. But as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place. The meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour. The onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy. I loved the Hi-C. \n\nYou know you just never know if you will like something until you try it. I tired it and that is enough. Nice friendly folks though. I do like friendly. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really liked their beer selections.  This place is a nice hometown \""big\"" bar.  Not chain-like.  The staff wasnt the friendliest but the food, beer, and prices made up for that.  I would definitely suggest checking it out on a NFL SUnday too. Whole lot of TVs.  \n\nEnjoy\n\nIan M. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The giant horse scared me! I thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance.\n\nOn a nice summer night, we weren't able to get a seat outside because there was a graduation party going on. Instead we sat inside and listened to the Michael Buble-ish croonster and his homeless sidekick. I'm not sure if he was homeless but he was rocking on the bass guitar and would add in his \""oh yeahs\"" and \""uh huhs\"" during an intense jam session. It was creepy and cute.\n\nMy friend bought the table a round of marachino cherries that are laced with vodka and cinnamon rum. It was interesting but way too strong for my tastes.\n\nI started with an Oak Creek Hefe which was warm so the server brought me frosty mug but that didn't help either. I ordered the Spicy Cajun Sausage appetizer and it was nothing more than a bowl of sliced sausage links floating in a cold hot sauce. It was disgusting. I had to ask the server if the appetizer was meant to be cold. I'm just not a fan of cold sausage. The best part of my meal was the sourdough bread- and it was damn good because I was starving!\n\nOh yeah- the bathroom was pretty scary. I liked the mops and brooms in there too, really made me feel like I was peeing inside a janitor's closet. Oh wait-- maybe it was! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There was a time, when service at this company was excellent. I have used this company for over 10 years. I went down a couple week ago because my pool sweep wasn't working. The person at the counter, was pathetic when it came to providing service. My wife went back to pick the pool sweep, the guy that waited on her was eating his lunch at the front counter. She said she would never go back there again, because the service was so poor. My pool sweep was under warranty they told me, there was nothing wrong with the sweep, it just need to be cleaned. They charged me 20.00 to clean it. When I put it in the pool it still had the same problem. I took it to Leslie Pool Supply they took it a part while I was there replaced a couple parts put it back together and didn't charge me, because it was still under warranty.  It works now. I have spent my last dollar with Checker.. guess who my new pool company is! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A friend at work was having a bad day, and mournfully insisted that the only thing that would help was some soul food. Naturally, I was along for the ride. \nSimmons is definitely one of 'those places.' You know, the one that people talk about when they brag that it's where \""people who are really from the Carolinas\"" go, and it's apparent. This place is as holey in the wall as holes in the wall come. \n\nAtmosphere: I think the best way to describe it would be nonchalant. When you walk in, they know you're there. People look up at you if you're not a regular. Yes, they'll clean off a table and seat you, make some chat, get your drinks and take your order at what is the epitome of the southern pace. If you're a foodie who taps their toe if it takes more than 5 minutes to wipe off a table, then this place isn't for you. If you have some time to kill and want to feel like you're eating in someone's kitchen that they extended to include a few other lucky people, then you've hit jackpot. \n\nService: I had to keep reminding myself that I wasn't related to this person. I love it when waitstaff have just the right amount of crabby/fussy/humor, and this was a prime example. The attitude was, \""Hangon a dang minute, I'll get there when I get there, you'll eat what we give you, and girl you did NOT finish all of your vegetables.\"" \n\nFood: Mmmmmmm. Ribs are good, and I found out pretty quick that how fast you make nice is directly proportional to how much food you get. Luckily, I got saddled with leftovers. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, at a decent price, with that tangy sweet sauce that so many people like. I'm more of a smoky myself, but I can recognize good sauce when it's given to me. Complimentary cornbread at the beginning of the meal was plain and delicious, and the collards weren't that overly cooked mushy that I can't stand. Very good food experience.\n\nOverall, one of those places where you go for the people just as much as the food, and a true southern food experience if there ever was one. If you can make decent convo, sit down and eat something delicious, and if not, gtfo, mon hommes. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I hate this place.\nIt's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went with the suggestions of Yelpers and stopped in to Coach and Willie's for drinks pre- Dbacks game.  It was a good choice, I think.  I didn't care for the outside which has loud music playing but inside it's a nice pub (upscale is a bit of a stretch...) with lots of TVs tuned to sports.  We were able to snag two seats at the bar and even ordered some nachos.  \n\nA few thoughts:\n\nStanding room is kind of scarce.  If it ever got really packed you would have to stand around people at tables eating and while I don't really care I know that its something my husband doesn't like to do.  \n\nIt took forever to get the bartenders to notice us and take our orders.  And we were sitting at the bar!  When our nachos came they were asking for the \""S.\"" party and we were flailing our arms in front of the bartender and screaming \""that's us!\"" and she still didn't see us!\n\nThe bartenders were pretty cool.  They made some futile attempts to get a \""Let's Go Dbacks\"" chant going but the crowd wasn't that into it.  (And at that point there weren't that many Cubs fans there...)  They had a good healthy banter with the Cubs fans which was amusing.   They didn't care when we ordered shots of Jager, although the two female Cubs fans next to us were shocked.  (Sorry, this is just how we roll.  We don't take shots of whatever that nuts and berries concoction that you're drinking is....)  \n\nThe nachos were strange.  The chicken was like grade F chicken and there was a lot of the fixings but they were not well layered at all.   There was a ton of stuff on top (including all the guac and sour cream) then a bunch of naked chips and then a whole ton of cheese and all the beans on the bottom.  We also asked for jalapenos on the side, but they just didn't give them to us at all.\n\nI would definitely go back here before a game again.  It was a good relaxed atmosphere and a quick walk over to the stadium.  However, I think I'll probably stick with drinking there and save my munchies for the ballpark. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  WOW this place is a complete dive I don't even no where to start. Ok our hotel room smelled of marijuana and a bathroom cleaner combo. Then learned the bathroom door was a slider. Yup no door knob a hole for a finger slot. So when your in the bathroom you can watch tv. Not my type of place the shower is like an RV camper the neighborhood is terrible tour next to a Waffle House and jack in the box I put the ac on smelled like burning hair  I heard Police and fire truck sirens All night very noisy the next-door neighbor was either living there or been there along time tons of people coming and going must of been dealing drugs then breakfast was a joke hot pockets and water down waffles SMH shameful the lady stood there while we are preparing our food like a security guard overlooking everything making sure u didn't take two unsoft butter overall I would never recommend this <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm sorry. I'm sorry I am allergic to latex. This is what I had to keep on telling the nail tech when she was doing my feet. Walked in for a nice pedicure and I should have walked right out when I saw the look on her face when I told her I was allergic to latex.  But she said it's ok, it's  ok sit down, sit down.  I know there are other types of gloves..vinyl or non latex they need to buy at least one box because I know I'm not the only one who is allergic. Anyway..I was in and out in about 20 min. It was awful, 10 min soaking 10 for the pedicure. It was obvious she didnt want to touch my toes, which aren't that bad, without gloves. I wish she would have said no when I came in the door. Oh they don't take any cards just cash. Will not go back here even if it was free! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is probably the worst Ulta when it comes to customer service. I am not a needy customer and more often than not I prefer to be left alone to do my shopping. However, I do appreciate being acknowledged and I am even more a fan of having my questions answered in the event that I do need some assistance. This is not the case at this location. The salesgirls seem unfriendly and completely uninterested in helping/recommending/selling. I honestly wonder if being as unhelpful as possible is part of their job description. If it is, then they are doing stellar! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We popped into CoffeeWorks on a dreary, overcast day and were greeted by a friendly woman behind the counter.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had flavored coffee!   Other than my favorite coffee chain (Barnie's Coffee, which is slowly closing each and every store), nobody seems to offer flavored coffee.  Unless you go to a convenience store attached to a gas station (what's up with that anyway?).  Starbucks and Caribou only offer different coffees like dark or light roast.  Nothing else.  I only wished that CoffeeWorks had more than one flavored coffee available for the day.  I saw a wall of glass jars full of many, many flavors for coffee that they sell by the bag.  The coffee sizes were reasonably priced, too.  My only suggestions for them would be to (1) create a more relaxed seating area indoors other than basic tables and (2) switch to something besides the environment unfriendly styrofoam cups.  Otherwise, keep up the great work (and flavored coffees!); we'll be back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  22 minutes to get my order. Terrible service! I was the only one in the store when I placed my order although there were 3 cars in drivethru. Not acceptable! The only thing keeping this from getting a 1-star review is that (1) the restaurant was clean and newly remodeled, and (2) they did get the order accurate... again, after 22 minutes... not acceptable! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  They do have just about any kind or type of battery. My issue is with the website. After looking up the battery you need, then you select the store nearest you and check stock. Then you arrive there to purchase the battery and they tell you they DO NOT HONOR THE INTERNET PRICES. When the internet site directs you to a store they should honor the price. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We arrived at McHale's around 7:30 on Friday night, looking forward to some pub fare and live music.  Although the parking lot was full (I had to wait for a car to leave before I was able to park), we were able to find a table immediately on entering.\n\nThe inside is well decorated, clean, and inviting.  We were approached fairly quickly by our server, who asked for our drink orders.  We needed a few minutes to peruse the beers on tap listing.  From that point on, our experience was unbelievably bad.\n\nIt took us all of 2 minutes to figure out our drink preferences, but it was 10 minutes before our server returned.  She took our drink order and would have left straight-away, but we stopped her and asked for potato cakes as an appetizer, as we were famished.  It was 20 minutes later that the appetizers arrived, and we had to ask the runner where our drinks were.  5 minutes later, they appeared.\n\nWe were completely done with our appetizers (and still hungry) when our server finally returned and asked (in an incredulous tone) if we wanted to order dinner.  If you're not keeping track, I'll remind you that we've now been at McHale's for 40 minutes!  We ordered fish and chips (for me) and a veggie sandwich (for the wife), thinking that would be among the quicker-to-prep items on the menu.\n\nIt took just over 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  At least it was hot.  The fish was fine -- standard pub-style cod -- but the fries on both of our plates were only the end pieces, as though they had run out of full-figured fries and were dredging the bottom of the bag to find something to serve.  They were all crisp, no potato, and no flavor.  My wife's veggie sandwich was very plain.\n\nI'll spare you the remaining saga, but I'll bet you can guess that it was more of the same as it took us one hour and fifty minutes before we had paid our tab and were able to leave.  I understand that sometimes  as a table you end up in a perfect storm of minor mishaps, and I would never give up on a restaurant for that alone.  But through all of this, our server only showed up at our table 4 times, and was dour and terse to boot.  \n\nWe were in no rush.  In fact, we had planned on taking our time so we could enjoy the live music.  But poor service ruled the day.  All it would have taken to turn our frustration into an adventure was engaging interaction and some smiles from our server.  Any restaurant or server can get overwhelmed or behind, but there is never an excuse for poor customer service. <|endoftext|>

The older brunette woman behind the counter is not only incredibly rude but she an amazingly small amount of knowledge for all things shipping! I could grab any homeless person off their medication and place them behind the counter and their endless ramblings about the C.I.A. putting a chip in thier brain would make more sence then this older woman. This is the problem with the ups store no two are alike. This ups store is like a private sector version of the DMV! Steer clear! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My boyfriend has been wanting to bring me here for a while so I was very excited to give this place a try.\n\nThe grocery part of the store has a great selection of Caribbean food, seasonings and drinks. But the most exciting part to this store is the restaurant. Which offers a huge variety of Caribbean food that they prepare fresh daily. They have everything here from jerk chicken and oxtails to chicken and beef patties. \n\nI let my boyfriend chose our meal and as previous reviews have mentioned the portion sizes here are huge! So you are safe to order something and share it with a friend or two! We we shared an order of stew chicken, rice and peas, veggies and of course a chicken and beef patty.\n\nThe stew chicken was soooo tender and full of flavor! Mixed with the rice and peas and veggies it was absolutely delicious!!! And those patties were outstanding! I only tried the chicken but it was huge and so packed with filling and flavor, all I can really say is Yum...Yum!!! Highly recommended!\n\nI definitely recommend this place but just make sure you are hungry when you go! <|endoftext|>

I personally love the chili dog.  The sliders are great too and  the french fries are the type that are amazing when warm but are still amazing when there cold.  You can also get authentic cheese fries, which accordingly to my girlfriend (a Chicago native) is nearly impossible in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. We go to it at least 3 times a month. <|endoftext|>

We like it so much that we put it on our wedding registry. I give this location 5 stars because it's simply the best BBB I've ever been to. \n\nWhat's so great about this location? \n\n1. An integrated Cost Plus World Market with huge assortment of specialty foods and beverages. On certain days, they've got mimosa samples.\n\n2. Amazing customer service. We really felt welcome. They even did a great job of helping us with an online-order return. \n\n3. A special post-wedding discount for couples with a registry. Basically, you go in, they'll print off your registry, and give you a discount on your total purchase that day. There was even a continental breakfast for those who showed up for the occasion. I don't know how often they do this, but it's a tremendous idea. \n\nCome on, it's Bed Bath and Beyond! And, I'm a shameless fan. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've lived in the Phoenix area for eight years and have eaten at dozens of different Mexican places looking for the best food. Rosita's Place has consistently come out on top. Their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. Let me say that again: their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. I like their carne asada burrito and their green chili is also good. \n\nThe building looks a little worn from the outside, but inside it's very clean and the service is always good. I wish they had other locations because it's a long drive from where I live in Chandler. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In the past when my husband and I needed to purchase good quality furniture we always went to Walter E Smith in the Chicago area.  Since living here we made the change to Ethan Allen.  We purchased a full living room from them this past spring and have been very happy with almost everything.  The service was great and the sales person listened to us and put together exactly what we wanted with one exception.  We asked for tables (specifically a coffee table) that could stand up to some abuse because we have a 16 month old at home.  The table he recommended is beautiful but does not at all stand up to what he said it would.  This table is only 3 1/2 months old and already has wood chipping off, many many dents and looks absolutely horrible.  This table is so softI can dent/scratch it with my fingernail.  Ive have better quality tables from Target and World market for 1/3 the price.  After only 2 months use I called the store to tell them the sales clerk clearly did not know the product he was selling, if he did he never would have recommended this table.  I was told they did not cover customer abuse and can't be held accountable for a sales person giving me bad information.  It's the sylvan coffee table....DO NOT BUY IT!!  I dropped the remote control on it and it left a huge dent.  They wouldn't even offer to come out to see if the table was defective or had the wrong finish.  I told them I would bring it in myself and they said no.   My end tables and cocktail table are extremely durable/well made and are exactly what I wanted.  I am disappointed the table I was most concerned about is horrible. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place was my very first Thai experience 5 years ago and it was delicious! We had one of the curries and it was the perfect balance of flavors. This place is what turned me on to Thai food being my favorite food. The restaurant itself is nice and their Thai iced tea was yummy. I wish the hours were better though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Stayed here for 1 night since I was on my way home to San Jose,CA from Tucson, AZ, I decided to stay in Phoenix for 1 night so I could go to a D-Backs game, this Motel 6 isn't a far drive to Chase Field, they put me in a room with 2 twin beds when I requested on my reservation that I wanted a queen size bed, I asked them why I got a room with two twin beds and they told me they couldn't give me one because they we're doing some kind of work to the vacant rooms with queen beds, I was very disappointed about this since I'm a tall guy, I need to sleep at least on a queen size bed. Their prices are great which is the main reason why I stayed here but I doubt I will be back at this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here on my lunch break at work, because it is right up the road.  They have an ecelectic menu for lunch, with a lot of gyros.  I decided on the fish gyro and called it in.  It was ready within seven minutes or so, not bad at all.  A couple of my coworkers and I came to the store together to pick it up.  The line was almost out the door, it seems really popular for people who work around here.  Honestly though I think it is just because there aren't many other choices around here.  \n\nWhen we got up to the counter a waitress asked the cashier, \""Did they give you a tip?\""  We thought she was joking so we laughed.  \""Seriously,\"" she replied.  Wow, how rude!  Not to mention my fish gyro was dry and I had to load it up with tartar sauce, thank god I was really hungry. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The people working were really nice and our food was good but could have been more evenly distributed, one side of the sandwich was really loaded with everything then the other side was just bread? But was still a good half sandwich. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I found Karen on Yelp and Wedding Wire. The price was awesome, flowers were gorgeous and Mandap was Amazing.  Karen was creative and responsive to my requests.  Score one for style and my budget.  Even my wedding planner was impressed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. It's a bit edgier than most of the others bars in the area, which also gives it a lot more character. This place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that I'm used to in Southern CA. \n\nShadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows. \n\nAlways good vibes at Shadow! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We love it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. The Osso Buco to die for. This is not a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good Northern Italian Food <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Jewish girls in Chinese dresses serving Japanese food. If that isn't a recipe for confusion, I don't know what is.\n\nToo bad, really. Because when they first opened up, they had a real Japanese chef who had a respectable career and was trying to make actual Japanese cuisine. He naturally didn't last long in this 1980s pseudo-asian theme park environment. Remember when the owner used to intermittently drop the screens down and fire up the THX system and play movie trailers from last year? The chefs couldn't even see their hands. Now that's setting your priorities!\n\nHappy hour and late night patio is this place's saving grace (for others, not for me). But it's so far from Japanese food/sushi as to make them guilty of false advertising. See my Stingray review for a similar take on the food experience. If you FAIL rice, you FAIL sushi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First of all, Sarah was the most awesome waitress!!! Loved her wine selection suggestions, as well as dinner entree recommendations!\nThe Paccheri Alla Siciliana was a wonderful marinara sauce tossed with eggplant Fresh Bufula Mozzarella balls and was delicious! \nThe pappardelle al funghi, a delicious while wine and olive oil sauce, was tossed with pasta and shiitake mushrooms! \nBoth dishes were delicious and the amazing pure ricotta cannoli for dessert, excellent!!! \nHighly recommend this restaurant. We ate in the upstairs wine bar. But will definitely come back to sit in the beautiful courtyard garden! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So I need a haircut.  And in a Costco in southeast Phoenix, where I live, I see this gentleman about my age (senior) sporting a really good do.  I ask him who does his hair, and he gives me the same of Sandy Clark at Salon Boulevard.  I call Sandy and make an appointment for 3:15 on Wednesday June 4. \n\nToday (Wednesday June 4) I roll out, leaving plenty of time for the 20-mile-odd trip, but Sandy's directions are so bad that I spend almost 20 extra minutes trying to find the Salon. \n\nAt 3:15, the moment I realize I'm going to be late, I call the number Sandy gave me; the same one I used for the appointment.  It's her cell phone, and it goes to voicemail.  I leave a message explaining I will be a few minutes late. \n\nAt 3:30 I call again.  I get voicemail again. I  leave a second message explaining that I am cruising the parking lot unsuccessfully, but nonetheless on my way, when I spot the Salon.  It's minuscule, and tucked away in a dark corner with tiny signs to identify it. At 3:35 I am inside. \n\nSandy, however, has left.  Deciding within 10 minutes that I would be a no show, and not bothering to check her phone, she trotted off to do something far more important than attend to a paying customer with a reservation: you know, someone who might easily have become a repeat customer who brings his own friends in.   \n\nInstead, she gets this sucky review on Yelp!, plus warnings to all my personal friends, colleagues and business associates to stay away from her and from Salon Boulevard.  Oh, and on Facebook too.  What her hairdressing skills are like I can not personally vouch for ... but if she loses focus this easily, I guess I'm glad I never had the opportunity to find out. \n\nThe lady behind the counter tried to offer me another appointment with Sandy Clark on some future day, but given the above -- plus I don't see the point in another 40-plus-mile, possibly pointless round trip -- I won't be showing up there again. Ever.\n\nAnd in my opinion, neither should you.  \n\n(Tabitha, where are you? Salon Boulevard needs you!) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We decided to try this placed based on the good reviews here. It was awful. We ordered a few items from the menu for take out and we were truly disappointed.  The sauce did not come on the chicken and the chicken was EXTREMELY dry. We couldn't eat any of it.  Total waste of money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is one of the old school Waffle House's; not one of the new clean ones!  Not sure if that's good or bad but who really cares when you're there in the wee hours of the AM?!?!  There's probably not a lot to say here because who's never really been to a WH, right?  If you haven't then your probably visiting from a foreign country...\n\nAny who, the staff here is always friendly and eager to serve.  The ham and cheese omelet is fluffy and cooked just right.  It's pretty impressive to cook one this well because I've had a few that were as tough as a leather bag.  The 'All Star' breakfast is the best deal and guaranteed to add an inch to your waiste or a bad case of late night heartburn.  \n\nBest joke I ever heard at a Waffle House in college:  \""What has six boobs and eight teeth?\""  Answer: \""The night shift at the Waffle House!\""\n\nEnjoy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ok, even yelpers can be overly dramatic...This hotel is just fine, nothing special but not the scary place other yelpers have claimed. I stayed in a Cabana room which was nice, decent sized balcony, micro/fridge, HDTV, free wifi, quiet AC, big bathroom, adequate bed. The parking lot is not a block away, it's literally a 1 minute walk from the hotel entrance and is free. The hotel is NOT in a scary neighborhood by any stretch. The dowtown train thing IS about a block away. It'll take you down to the sports arenas in minutes. I was on the \""west\"" side which was all of a 30 second walk from the front. If you're not completely lazy, enjoy free parking/wifi and want to save a few bucks, stay here..I payed $70 for Saturday night on short notice. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Mouth is watering just thinking about this place!!\n\nThe boyfriend and I FINALLY decided to try it out after passing it for almost a year. I loved how they kept it true and retro. Very cute inside. The service was very poor. Our waitress was sitting up at the soda bar eating when we walked in, then sat us down, handed us menus, didn't greet us and told us to just ask if we have questions to ask the table behind us since they apparently had a lot that she had answered before we arrived. Most awkward intro ever. We did have a lot, since it was our first time there and we didn't know how the menu worked. We ended up ordering a butterscotch-cookie dough ice cream soda and a fudge sundae with pistachio and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and nuts. OMG it was soooo yummy!! Biggest sundae I had ever been served! And you can bet I ate that entire thing!  When we got our bill we couldn't believe how cheap it was for all that amazingness! We can forgive the customer service because that's not the main reason we went there in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> With the addition of the cronuts and new flavors, I have to rave about the new variety but same old taste. What can I say? Being the duke adds responsibility of ensuring this place gets the credit for best donut shop in Phoenix!\n\nNow, what makes a good donut? It has to be light and fluffy. Not light as in fat free, but light and fluffy, as you take a bite, your teeth sink right through the icing and dough. It leaves a moist chew in your mouth while allowing you to savor the flavor. Rainbow delivers this with every single donut! You got that right, I just dropped some donut knowledge up in here.\n\nI have heard many great things about cronuts. I mean I love croissants, but mixed with a donut? Oh yea, I am feeling the jive now. We tried the glazed and cinnamon. It wasn't light and fluffy, but definitely a soft crunch that packs the same old Rainbow flavor that this location only offers. Does this beat out my maple bar infatuation? Please don't make me choose! However, I will have to be so bold to say that this place keeps getting better. The family is great, the service is top notch, and it makes this Yelper proud to be Duke! Lastly, they mix the cronuts with fresh fruit if you so choose. That is definitely next on my list! Do I even need to say I will see you again Rainbow? Oh yea, probably next Sunday! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK, OK... I finally went and ate at a Hooters while I was on a business trip.  Their supposedly best hot wings aren't even close to being the best.  The food wasn't all that either...  Sure, there's pretty girls prancing around with their old school bright orange old school NBA short shorts, but it doesn't make the food taste any better. Then again, I guess you don't really go to Hooters for the food. =P\n\nRecommendations: N/A <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  First off let me say this TGIF is gonna get the brunt of a couple of other TGIF visits I've had around the Charlotte area. I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud. \nIt took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. \nSo I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time. Fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me, fool me three times....... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my go-to place for Pho. I normally get take out since I live in the area, but sitting here is quite an experience too. This is authentic Vietnamese food. \n\nHighly recommend to anyone looking for some good Pho. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The only reason I remained a member here for a year was solely because of the location. As far as price goes, no complaints. But a lot of the equipment is outdated and there is always at least one piece of equipment broken. The gym in general does not feel clean. I would avoid the men's room at all cost. And the free weight area always had a very distinct smell of urine and mold.\nThe trainers were always friendly and would say \""hi\"" but the front desk staff generally seemed more concerned with their conversations amongst themselves then acknowledging members. \n When it was finally time for me to move and cancel my membership it took almost a month to get it done. Their first excuse was sorry there's not a manager on duty, it was a Saturday afternoon.. The second time I was given a phone number to call after 3 tries and 20plus minutes of holding I tried going back in again. The third time I tried the front desk guy said \""Just go work out and afterwards you can cancel\"" An 45 minutes later... \""Oh sorry the manager stepped out you can come back later today if you want to cancel.\"" This place could not be more poorly run. Other then the convenient location and hours there is not much else positive to say about this gym. I would never recommend this gym to anyone. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been here many time in the last few years since the JitB at cave creek and cactus turned into filiberto's. the only reason i even come to this one instead of the one at 32nd & cactus which is just as far from my current house is the food quality is better here, i have never really had a 'good' experience here but it's sorta what to expect. but several times in the past, yesterday and now today they have told me to stop and wait after the car ahead of me leaves so they can \""fix their time/clocks\"" I always got frustrated because of this but today it almost got domestic in the parking lot after the cars behind me started honking their horns, i yelled at the DB directly behind me that i was instructed not to pull up, after the employee \""Julia\"" came to the window and told us just to pull up, i demanded an explanation, and to speak to the manager, but she said said there was no explanation and hesitated to say the managers name, instead she just kept saying \""he is working the back and can't talk now\"" so i kept demanding until she said it. it was a terrible experience and i don't see myself returning here for a very long time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Our tour guide was the worst tour guide I've ever had. I've been on many brewery tours and grains do not get their flavor from being in honey or dipped in chocolate. Many of us realized she was completely clueless. The number of uhs, ums, and ahs overwhelmed me. At least 21 in one room of the tour. I had to stop counting for my own sanity. By the end, most people had stopped listening or began to have their own conversation. It's unfortunate for a place to lose customers due to their tour especially when they have good beer. I'd love my money back but I doubt I'd get it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've purchased wood here for years, and recommended this business to friends.  But today, I pulled up to purchase a couple bags of wood, and the employee who was supposed to be selling me the wood took a look at my \""Obama 2012\"" bumber sticker, took a few steps back, and then said sarcastically \""well, i GUESS I will still help you, even though you voted for Obama\"".   Not only was this rude, but none of your business.  You are in the business of selling wood, and I guess also you are in the business of trying to insult your customers.  Sour grapes cause your candidate lost the election? Keep that to yourself, Sir, and just load the wood in my car.  Rude.  Poor customer service. Inappropriate. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ana's review is spot-on. There is nothing here that isn't done much better at other Italian places in town. Only the fact that this place is so cheap keeps it afloat. \n\nThis is the Boyardee, (as opposed to the Boiardi) type of Italian food. Its Italian for people who pronounce it \""Eye-talian\"", without a hint of irony and think of garlic and basil as ethnic spices.\n\n1 star for the food and campy decor, 1 star for the prices that make a step towards redeeming it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the \""hole-in-the-wall\"" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We have been going to Eastwind for years and have always enjoyed it. I'm not sure what has happened recently (I heard new management? ) but it has been going down hill fast. The final straw was when I went in on a Sunday evening to order a simple teriyaki chicken bowl and was charged over $12! I asked why and was told the \""bowl\"" is now a lunch menu item and dinner is a \""combo\"" with a salad. When I got my to go order I had to ASK for the salad (after all I did pay an additional $6 for it). When I got home I saw that all the SMALL (4\"" \u00d7 4\"" container)  salad is was only lettuce with lots of bad celery- I took two bites and threw it out! The chicken was also just blah.  So disappointed.  I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So I fly on average twice a month. I'll start off by saying that it's all about which Terminal you use. If you're travelling Southwest or US Airways, you will unfortunately have to use Terminal 4. While it is the new and largest Terminal, it is also the busiest....by FAR!!!!! I can never accurately predict how busy it will be. On any random Friday, I can expect a LONG, SLOW security line-especially when I'm running late. I still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long......and don't get me started on the security and x-ray stations. I got to experience the awesome new airport in Singapore and thinking about while in line at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor almost makes me cry every time.\n\nWhere this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks. This is where Terminal 4 shines. They close early though, so if you're leaving after 8:00pm, forget about a drink, Pizza Slut or Cinnabon.\nTerminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security. It is a BREEZE and about as stress free as you can get in the U.S. The flip side is that there is ONE bar and it is lame. So there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have, having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing Terminal 4. \nSo to sum up, Terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you WON'T be able to experience because it took so long to get through security. And as stressed as you are after security, it really sucks because you'll NEED a drink-but your flight's leaving in 6 minutes.\nYou will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use Terminal 2, but HOW you kill that time is going to be problematic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The pedicures at DeStefinos  are a complete rip-off. IMO\n\nWhen I booked the $53 pedicure, I was told\n(1) it would last an hour ,  and would\n(2) include  a foot massage   \n\nNot true:  the manicurist was done in 45 minutes.  and \nThe advertised  foot massage consisted of a quick rub of my feet and lower leg, finished in two minutes or less.  \n\nWhen the manicurist was done, I complained that\nmy feet were still rough.  \""You can't possibly expect your feet\nto be smooth after only one pedicure.\""\n\nExcuse me?  and why not?  Every other pedicure I've had\n(for much less money) got my feet smooth, <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide, Robinson, and Ross Park. Even though it closer to my Dad's House when visiting...its time for us to part ways. The food and service is never as good at this location. I love, love, love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. I couldn't even finish them, even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them. Total Bummer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Originally left a bad reviw. Bur since then I was contacted by the district manager. You really seem to care about this restaurant's reputation. He said they're making improvements and that I should try it again. I told him I would and I will hold my review until I do that again. Everybody deserves a second chance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love, LOVE this place.  The sushi at this place is what I use as a basis to compare other sushi.  I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.\n\nI should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Really disappointing customer service experience.  \n\nI purchased tickets originally to see the production of Pippin.  Being a frequent flyer at Gammage, the Herberger, the Phoenix Symphony, etc, I was really excited for my first experience at the Phoenix Theater.  Also I heard great things about the show.  \n\nWe found out the day of the show that the production was cancelled due to an injury in the cast.  Completely understandable and I was happy to reschedule.  Due to travel for work, the only other show I could make was the last showing on Sunday.  \n\nUnfortunately, I was delayed due to weather in the East Coast and missed the show.  The Phoenix Theater box office has rather limited phone hours and I was unable to get a hold of anyone.  Finally, on the day following the show, I spoke with a person who basically refused to help me in any capacity.\n\nI would have been happy with a refund, an exchange, a coupon for a cookie, anything.  But instead the Phoenix Theater took my money ($180) and said \""Sorry.\""  Surprising given the fact that I've found other venues very accommodating (looking at you Gammage).  I am in a customer-focused industry, and simply taking a one's money while offering nothing in return is incredibly poor service.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNot-one-to-leave-really-bad-reviews-often <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Booo! \n\nI can't stand Sprint. Not to go all \""Consumer Reports\"" on Yelp, but my report is that Sprint is an unethical, slimey, seething parasite to our society.\n\nThey \""fine print\"" you to death, so that before you know it your once manageable phone bill now has ballooned beyond your most pessimistic expectations. \n\nThey change phone plans, so that you can't switch up or down for anytime minutes without taking a serious hit. \n\nOn top of that, they make you renew your contract for two years every time you need to adjust your plan. \n\nNightmarish - that's the word I was reaching for. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow, not a lot of one stars in my review history so here we go......Salsarita's was the first \""Mexican\"" place I tried when I moved to Charlotte....from Phoenix. Needless to say, I had high expectations, even if it was a step above Taco Bell. My first experience was absolutely horrible--I ordered a burrito which was cold, wet and dripping some kind of funky juice. Gross.\n\nI went there a number of times after my initial bad experience and all I can think is no. I went there solely because for awhile were no other Mexican food options Uptown close to me and they offer a number of coupons in the Citpass book. But I've always been disappointed there, even up to last wk when I went there for the last time ever. Maybe it's the fact that the food had no flavor (seriously how does spicy salsa have no flavor?) or the fact that any time I used my check card there and didn't give them a tip (you know since they prepared my food), they would add a $1 or $2 in the tip line.....every....single....time. No bueno, sorry Salsarita's, you are officially Salsash***ty's in my book. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Like some of the other reviewers have said, don't let the location or decor deter from enjoying some of the best Eritrean food you're ever going to find.  \n\nMy kids, for some odd reason, love Ethiopian/Eritrean food, and we've tracked it down in New York, Chicago, DC, and our hometown, Philadelphia.  I think we were unanimous that this was the best that we had ever eaten.  The spices were fresh, intriguing, and well-balanced, and the quality of all the ingredients seemed very high.  Good injera, too.  We loved everything on our platter, and were treated well by the hostess. \n\nIt's not going to look like much when you walk in, but stick around and order everything--you won't regret it! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's a slow, but steady slide... \n\nTrying to count the total number of times I've been into the Harmony is futile; Yelp shows I have 16 check-ins, but I'd venture a guess that I check-in maybe once for every 2-3 visits.\n\nInteracting with the bartenders, one would think each of my visits was my first. They don't seem to recall regulars, or if they do, they don't seem to care much. Not looking for any special treatment, but when I walk-in, sit down and say, \""Hi, how's it going?\"" I'd hope for a bit of a reply other than a grunt or a \""I'm so busy I couldn't possibly bother with a response\"" eye roll.\n\nFood is continuing to slide; had a cheeseburger with fried onions last night... the dry bun overwhelmed the small, overcooked burger. A mound of fried onions delivered almost no extra flavor. Removed the bun and ate the burger solo.\n\nLake Louie Arena Premium is usually a fave of mine, but the one I had on Saturday (a few days earlier) tasted off - like the tap line was in need of a good cleaning.\n\nI also wasn't allowed to start a tab; it was pay-as-I-go... so, when I ordered food and a beer, I had to pay (and tip). Need a refill? Pay again. Ugh.\n\nThere are so many great places in the area; I'll be visiting the other haunts. So sad.\n\nPub chips, though... yum. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. \n\nI asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem. \n\nWhat she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... \n\nHow much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. \n\nAll in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee. And frankly, I never want to put that stuff in my mouth again. I don't see what this place has to offer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My wife and I went for dinner last night. We got there and where told it would be about 11minuites to be seated. It took 4. Our Waiter (Cameron) was there at the table very quickly. He got our drink order and my Wife ask if they had Prime Rib. Cameron said it was running short. He took our order and was back quickly. They where out of Medium Rare Primerib. He brought us menus again and we started over. In a few minutes he was back with a piece of the oven roasted Fillet. We sampled it and decided to go with that. Cameron was on top of the Ice Tea and service was amazing. The manager stopped by to check on things and I expressed how great Cameron was doing. The manager comped our desert and gave me his card. He said call ahead and they would save some Prime Rib in the future for us. This is the best experience I have ever had at any chain restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Such a pleasurable experience! Everyone one from Jason at the front desk, to Katherine the stylist's assistant, to Richard the stylist were sweet, attentive, and professional! I came in there with a curly mess of long hair that hadn't been attended to in 9 months, and I left with hair worthy of an Herbal Essence commercial. I couldn't have asked for better service, a better style, or a better stylist! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very trendy busy hot spot and for good reason. Yummy large chesse board with fruit nuts and bread, chicken noodle soup with real chicken and veggies :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First time at Cousins despite being within one mile for six years. \n\nTried the Chipotle Cheesesteak on jalape\u00f1o cheese bread. It came with thinly sliced beef, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, chipotle mayo and hot pepper relish. It arrived on a soft roll, which is always dicey for take-away. \n\nI normally don't get all the healthy stuff (lettuce, toms or onions) but I forgot to ask about it. It was really good!  The beef was tender and juicy, the spices were spot-on and the veggies offered nice contrast. \n\nI would've preferred a bit of up-sell, since I had never been there. The cashier seemed to want to be done with me tho so I just got the sandwich. \n\nI will try it again, possibly with other choices next time.  I recommend the Chipotle Cheesesteak. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I used to love coming to foxy nails, and Missy was my nail tech, but they changed management and now it is horrible.  It is not clean anymore, the person running the front desk is rude and the clientele has changed dramatically.  I am in search of a new salon definitely! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Although Hey Betty pales in comparison to Eons, it's still one of the best vintage stores in Pittsburgh. The place is small and narrow, but has several floors, so it's bigger than it actually seems.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the selection is sometimes limited (mostly '60s-'70s), but what's for sale is unique and quality, and definitely well-priced.  I once bought a leather bomber jacket from the '70s for $30!  I tend to like their accessories more than their clothing: they have an amazing selection of footwear, ties/bowties, hats, jewelry, gloves and handbags on the cheap.  Hey Betty is such a fun place, and definitely worth a visit if you love vintage! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I usually have a Teriyaki or sweet and sour chicken bowl.  The price is good and the food is even better.  I've been going to Blue Fin since 2005.  The personable and quick customer service makes the experience all the better.  It's easily accessible by the lightrail and north from the Central Library.  Love this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Service was horrible from the start. We waited for an eternity just to get menus. There was even a wait after I personally had to ask them to bring us menus. The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.\n\nSecond biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.\n\nNow the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.\n\nIt's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...\n\nIf you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First time there. I must admit that the facility does have its priorities in order. Everything I could see was spotless and well maintained. The place had a wide variety of shops in the concourse for travellers passing by to their next destination. First time flying US Airways was and pleased at the experience. It reminded me of the days back before the United Continental merger. Continental always had consistent friendly service and majority of on-time arrivals. Generous portions of drink beverages and inflight snacks <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Unsanitary, unsafe and extraordinarily shady and dishonest.  \n\nSherry's Pampered Pets should be shut down.\n\nWe used Sherry's for boarding for about 1 1/2 years. Two very disturbing incidents led us to stop.\n\nFirst--we asked to use their restroom.  When we first started going to Sherry's we asked to tour the facilities. We were told that due to liability issues, they could not give us a tour, but we could look at the play areas through the outside windows.  We thought this was a little strange since every single other kennel we've ever been to was willing (and wanted) to give us a tour. We figured we had no reason not to trust them so we accepted their excuse. Fast forward 1 1/2 years-- I desperately needed to use a restroom.  They didn't want to let me use it at first, but I told them it was an emergency and they let me. Quickly learned why they did not want to let me back there or give customers tours of the facilities.  The closed off area, that they don't want customers touring, is unbelievably, phenomenally filthy. And that's an understatement. I have never seen a dirtier restroom in even the seediest, filthiest truck stop gas station I have ever been to.  More importantly--they had stacks of kennels that looked like they came from a puppy mill.  They only place i have ever seen such dirty kennels and such a filthy facility is in those gut-wrenching puppy mill videos you see on SPCA or PETA.  It should be criminal to be running such a disgustingly filthy boarding operation.\n\nSecond--We went on an extended vacation (about two weeks). When we returned, our dog looked very tired and skinny.  The owner's sister (the older lady with the tattoos) informed us that our dog had not been eating anything for almost the entire stay at the kennel and she had consistent diarrhea for same amount of time.  We asked her if they made any attempt to call us or a veterinarian and she confirmed that nobody from Sherry's Pampered Pets did so at any time. At least 1-2 weeks of diarrhea and lack of appetite and not a single person at Sherry's bothers to call us or take our dog to a vet. We confirmed this story 3 times with this lady (because we were so shocked and could not believe the level of neglect). Short of our dog dying, I can not think of a much more extreme case of kennel negligence.  This situation should be (and possibly is) criminal neglect.  \n\nWe returned to Sherry's within a few days to speak with Sherry.  When we did, her sister had completely changed her story (or so Sherry says).  Sherry claimed that her sister told her that our dog was sick for only the last 1-2 days of boarding. We asked Sherry to bring her sister out so we could confront her with her lie and Sherry refused.  Sherry's adult daughter then got in our face, yelling at us for \""accusing\"" her aunt of lying (which she blatantly did). Needless to say, Sherry refused to refund our money or pay or veterinarian bills.\n\nShort of our dog dying, we could not think of a more egregious, disturbing situation of animal neglect by a boarding kennel.\n\nNot only did Sherry's completely violate our trust, they abusively (and possibly criminally) neglected our dog.\n\nI really can not find the words to express how phenomenally disgusted and outraged we were over this case of extraordinary dishonesty, abuse and disturbing conduct by Sherry, her sister and her daughter. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Stayed at this Hotel for a few days and well there are some thins that need work but the good out weighs the bad.\n\non that note lets go with the bad.\nthe only thing i noticed was bad was the organization down at the front desk, they clearly had our rooms mixed up and it was just a mess... but i guess that was to be expected because there was a bunch of us, so i guess that was ok.\n\nstarting off with the room, very clean and there was a great view of the on site golf course. Adequate lighting, LCD TV, Couch and separate bedroom. \n\nInternet WiFi for a price of about $14 per night.\n\nChow Hall down stairs to the right when you walk into the entrance of the hotel.\nThe food was ok, regular cafeteria food to me and i actually have no problem with that. \n\nOn site workout room that consist of a full dumbbell rack, medicine balls, a few cardio machines and TV's.\n\nOnsite Golf course..... i dont play golf so.... i cant review it... i can only say that its there haha <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst customer service ever! \nWe entered Fridays one hour before the D-Backs game. We went into the bar and found two open bar tables. Before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available. He said yes, and we sat down. No one came to take our order for 10 minutes so we went to the bar and ordered drinks. A waiter came by after we received our drinks and gave us menus. Another waiter came by with more menus. After we had been at the table for 20 minutes, a hostess came over to say the table was reserved for the wait list and we had to move - the other table that was open when we came in was still open and there were at least eight tables open in the dining area. We told the hostess that a waiter told us we could sit there and she said it didn't matter. We asked for the manager. He reiterated that we had been told by a waiter that we could sit there, he didn't care. We asked if we could finish our drinks, since the other bar table was still vacant. He said no. We had to finish our drinks standing to the side of the bar (since you can't take them into the stadium). The table we were evicted from was never cleared or seated and when we left there was no wait list for seating. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have to admit, as someone who used to live in Chicago, and has eaten my fair share of Chicago-style pizza, I was ready to hate on a Chicago Pizza Joint in Phoenix. Despite my doubts, we decided to take our friend's advice and try this place. We rolled up on a Sunday night, and there was 45 minute wait which seemed to be a good sign.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, we were served by the peppiest server I have ever had in my life. Seriously, ever. At one point, when I asked for a refill on my water, she took my glass and SQUEALED, \""Water! Yay!\"" Never have I felt so affirmed in my choice of beverage! Thanks, peppy server.\n\nAs for the pizza, it was so, SO good. Deep dish, perfect crust, juicy tomatoes. No hating necessary--this is a Phoenix pizza joint that's worthy of the Chicago label! If we ever make it back to Phoenix, we will definitely stop back at Oregano's! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have wavered between 1 and 2 stars for this place.  The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.  \n\nI would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues, specially due to its age.  I just got a new pump put in and replaced the sand on my filter.  Everything is now in essentially brand new condition.  I have gone back and forth with them about every single issue I have had.  The last set of advice made my pool virtually unusable for a solid month this summer. \n\n I was told to dump a bunch of crap into my pool to raise its PH.  Two weeks later I put even more chemicals in there to lower the PH, right after it was raised!  I was told every single time I went in that my chlorine levels weren't registering.  I would add more shock, more tabs and whatever product they were selling me.  It seemed to work fairly well for the first year and a half or so, then I would have to drain my pool like clockwork.  I would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing.  Then those chemicals I spent hundreds on would require me to drain my pool every couple years!!\n\nMind you, these chemicals are not cheap.  In fact, Leslies prices are consistently 30 - 40% higher than the competition.  I purchased a vacuum head here for $40, only to find the same exact thing at Fry's next door for $25.  \n\nIn short, I was paying hundreds of dollars for chemicals that were causing more harm than good.  My CYA levels were so sky high that they don't even register on the test. \n\nI turned to the internet to find answers to my problems.  I found http://www.troublefreepool.com/ to be a great resource.  I switched to liquid chlorine and stopped using tabs and granular shock.  After a 80% drain of my pool I am back to square one and a recovering pool.  It is quite frustrating to spend hundreds, possibly thousands, on advice that just doesn't work.  I bought my own water testing kit (Taylor Technologies K-2006) and do all my own tests.  My pool chemistry is now in balance.  Something I never had when going to Leslies.  \n\nI'm over you, Leslies. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What can I say...they never do me wrong!  I try to frequent mostly local owned restaurants, but Oregano's just calls to me sometimes.  I love the unique salad selection and the fact that I get to choose small or large.  The pizza crust is the perfect thin-ness, the spices just right, I don't have to spend a fortune AND I get leftovers!  \nNow the service...again, I have never had to wait for drink refills, hunt down my server for extra napkins, or send back a cold pizza.  I always get upbeat and personable service and as a server mysef, this really makes me happy.  \nI don't remember every server's name I have had there, but definitely ask for Trish for great experience! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great selection of standard and unusual groceries, wonderfully fresh produce, and has the best salad bar and deli.  If you're putting on a special dinner, this is the place.  Also offers housewares, books and flowers, etc.\n\nSimilar to Dominicks' stores around Chicago.  Will cost more than the competition, but at times it's well worth it for the specialty items. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Visited them today to spruce up the Tacoma. Filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant, nice guy. Truck went through the wash. While in the drying line the guy that was supposed to be drying my truck spent more time flirting with his co-worker. He barely ran the rag around door jams. When they flagged me down, I walked around the truck. I asked if they were going to actually dry it  or was that extra?  Had to get them to finish washing the spots off. The windshield is still dirty. Had to remind them to put the antenna back on.   Could understand if they were busy,  but it was slow  This place is a joke. Wonder if the owners have any quality control in mind. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Not sure that I could eat here more than once every 10 years, but I'll take my chances. I suppose it helps that my doctor's office is 2,500 miles away and the chances are slim that I'll run into him here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Never never never utilize this place for meds.\nThe pharmacy staff is completely useless.\nMeds never on time even though promised.\nPersonal information sheet left on pick up counter  for anyone to see or walk away with.\nThe joke of a pharmacy tech who couldn't be bothered with you as she chats on personal calls in front of you instead of addressing your needs.\nMy experiences here have been so over the top negative that I had to pull my prescription out and contact both corporate as well as Sankyo(the drug company that makes my one hypertensive medication)to complain about the myriad of issues including blatant HIPPA violations that were the norm for this location.\nAside from the pharmacy,a good deal of the staff seem to be very much on the tweaky side of the fence...\nThe store manager is pleasant enough,but if he can't clean house of the current staff,it would be in his best interest to get the hell out of that location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This hotel is located on the west side of downtown Charlotte, less than one minute from Highway US 77. The location makes it very easy to get to and from the airport and any other highway taking you to parts of the city or its suburbs. \n\nIn early February 2009, the hotel was in the midst of a makeover. The lobby, the area around the elevators, and the common areas on the ground floor were inaccessible due to the construction. Based on the finished work in some parts, the end result promises to be spectacular and commensurate with what one would expect of a top notch DoubleTree Hotel. \n\nThe room was fantastic with a king sized bed and all of the amenities that usually accompany a DoubleTree hotel room. The property is far enough away from the nightlife of downtown to allow you to get a good nights sleep. Also it is within walking distance of the convention center if that is your destination. The staff was very helpful and the business center provides free Internet access in case you want to print out your boarding pass without incurring a fee. \n\nThe parking lot was confusing. I am certain that there were more than the 12 spots that I saw when I tried to park. It is my own fault for not following up with the staff to ascertain how to access the other sections of the parking lot, so I won' t hold that against the hotel. \n\nSince I obtained this booking via priceline.com, the rate was very good, probably due to the construction. I would not expect to get the same rate at this hotel once the construction is completed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So, I just moved in the area and was looking for a new place to get my hair cut. I gave this place a call and politely introduced myself and asked the woman on the phone whether they did only appointments or walk-ins today. She interrupted me mid-question and answered in a tone acting as if I was some kind of annoying pest. I ignore it and ask their approximate wait time and she laughs at me, says \""ugh.. just come in!\"" *click* Yes, she hung up on me. The phone call lasted all of 20 seconds.\n\nI immediately called a different barber shop and took my business to somewhere else. As a suggestion to whoever manages this place, please train the bitter, angry woman who answers your phone to have some basic courtesy because you just lost a potential twice-a-month loyal customer. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had a Gold reservation but arrived to find my name was not on the board. I waited in line with a dozen other livid Gold members and was then offfered a mini-van or to pay extra for an upgrade. If I gould give Hertz a zero I would. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I really like the location of Pleasant View - just on the west side of Madison, it's quick to get to.  The course itself is very nice.  I like the variety of the holes and it's always in pretty good shape.\n\nPrairie:  The \""Prairie\"" nine is probably the course I've played the most.  I like how it has thee par 3's, 3 4's and 3 5's.  That's different, but still adds up.  The holes have character, and if you're a long hitter, the par 5's are a chance to help your score.\n\nWoods:  The \""Woods\"" nine is probably the most scenic.  Obviously, you'll encounter some trees.  Again, holes with character.  Bring your bug spray in the summer!\n\nLake:  The \""Lake\"" nine is my least favorite of the three, but it's still decent.  There is some water on the hole, but it's named because you can see Lake Mendota from the hill it's on.  \n\nThe clubhouse is very nice - good food and a great patio to sit on after a round and enjoy a cold one.  The staff there are always very nice.  If you watch sites like golfnow.com you can find some great deals throughout the year.  I think Bucky Book and/or Entertainment Book have BOGO coupons, but watch for when they're applicable!\n\nThis is a very nice course that is great for all levels of play. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..\n\nTry a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Our country club recently hired the building company to install a rather large deck. After it was installed, several boards warped on the railing causing the dowels to fall out (dangerous) and the facia board all the way around warped. After MANY calls and emails they finally had someone show up only to say \""warping isn't covered\"". It arped after one month! They said they would fix it for additional money - $1200. I can promise you these people will NOT stand behind their work and if you can find another retailer/contractor, I highly recommend doing so. Do not do business with these people. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. The chips are to die for, the salads and tortilla soup were awesome. To top it off, the service by our waitress TJ (Tammy J) was excellent as she made us feel like guests in her own home. We'll go back again anytime we visit Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  One in our party summed it all up:  \""When you're paying these prices, you should expect better service.\""\n\nThe food was good.  I had a sashimi platter with some additional pieces, which was perfectly average.  You can get the same thing around the corner at Sushi Kim...and I think the quality is a bit better and the price lower.\n\nAnother in our party had the rib eye.  It was cooked well and he liked it.  For dessert the cheesecake was good, although the blueberries were clearly from frozen (unacceptable in July when they're in season).\n\nI had to sit and wait 5 minutes after my food was brought out before I could flag down a server to ask for some chopsticks and soy sauce.\n\nIt's not that the servers aren't working...it's that they're spread too thin.  Understaffed.  All working hard, but covering too many tables.\n\nLong story short, I won't go back.  Walk over one block and go to Eleven!  Same price, better food and service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This trendy little place has great pizza.  Pizza that makes you feel like you might be eating healthy because this is not a heavy pizza.  I love the slight spiciness of the sauce and the thinness of the crust.  It can be a little on the pricey side but it is worth it.  Expect lines on Friday and Saturday.  Check out the patio in the summer time.\n\n\nI used to live in Lebo and miss this place since moving to Charlotte, NC over four years ago.  I stop at Il Pizzaiolo every time I am back in town.  Charlotte really needs a place like this and the closest attempt is Brixx Pizza.  Been there a few times and the ingredients are not up to par with Il Pizzaiolo. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I got there at midnight to pick up my rental and the entrance was gated... After checking to make sure we weren't missing another possible entrance, we drove up to the exit and the pleasant employee informed me that they close the gate at midnight and everyone has to come in through this way... You know what would have been nice?  A sign that says that on the closed gate!  Something with a nice, little arrow that says, \""Hey, we're still open, just go right down here.\""  Is that hard?  I guess so.\n\nInside, the woman working at the counter was nice... She had me completely finished in about 10 minutes and I headed out to the car... It was a 2013 White Dodge Dart... I took a nice lap around the outside to make sure there weren't any dings or anything and went off into the night... I heard a weird ping sound while I was driving a few minutes in, but it was directly behind me, so I figured I would just check it out when I got home since we live pretty close to the airport... Ladies and gentlemen, I got home and checked the backseat of my rental car to find an empty bottle of Great Lakes' delicious Commodore Perry IPA!  Look, I understand that it's a delicious beer... I love beer almost any time, but you know when I don't love it?  When it's in my rental car, rolling around in the backseat with a fricking open container charge attached to it! What the H?! Upon contacting them the next day (because the manager wasn't onsite), I found out that the manager would \""talk to the employee\"" that cleans the cars, but they would accommodate me when I returned... \n\nThe car worked fine for the trip and it was time to return it... We pulled into the bay... We cleaned the interior and unpacked the luggage, but still hadn't seen a person to check us in... After about 10 minutes, I spotted two employees standing by a door, doing nothing... As I walked by them, they walked into the bay of cars, but only pressed on the hoods of them for some reason and just leisurely walked on to the next... Once I got to the front of the bay, I noticed a small sign that didn't even reach past the height of the hood of the car it was in front of ... It said that they do not have people to check in their cars... You have to leave the keys in the ignition, write down the mileage and check in the car inside... So no inspection upon return, guys?  I'm just supposed to trust that you won't run up some random charge on my card for damage or what not?  Really? \n\nInside was a straight up flustercluck... There is no other way to describe it... About 15 people waiting in line for TWO attendants and one of them ended up being tied up by one lady from France who didn't know she needed a $200 hold on her card... Apparently her boyfriend rented the car for her, but she doesn't have any more money and he won't go to the bank to put more money in the account... But she doesn't understand because this is a once in a lifetime thing and he never does anything for her and she needs him to leave where he is and go to the bank...  But he doesn't... At least not for the half hour I was in line to return this stupid car... The employee listened to her calmly and explained her options, so he gets points for that, at least... Then I noticed two other people come out of the back, walk through the area we were in and head outside... One of them was very clearly identified as a manager... How in the H do you miss a loudly complaining customer and about 15 other people with extremely unhappy looks on their faces packed into your lobby if you're in charge of something?  Oh, I know... You just don't give a f***... That's how.\n\nUgh.  Look, if you want to be open 24 hours, then you need to have enough employees on staff to make that happen as smoothly as possible... Otherwise, just close down and leave that for people that understand that good customer service doesn't only happen during traditional business hours! Oh! And my accommodation made for my possible arrest?  A 10% off coupon for another rental... Let me tell you where you can put that... On my next trip out of town, I will be renting a horse and leaving days ahead of schedule... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sonora is home to three of my biggest weaknesses: cream ales, Kobe burgers, and wings. In two of these three categories, they completely excelled. And in the third? Well, I'm really very picky about wings, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nThe cream ale is delicious, and it goes very well with the kettle chips and the chipotle ketchup. Yeah. Chipotle ketchup. I've never even heard of that before, but it's pretty much my new favorite condiment.\n\nThe Kobe burger is niiiice. I got mine medium rare, but I almost wish I'd asked for it extra-rare. I'm weird about ordering my beef rare in places I've never been to, but they cooked my med-rare burger perfectly, so I'd trust them to do rare really well. Wait, not well. Rare. You know what I mean.\n\nLike I said, I'm really picky about wings. I prefer mine to be drowning in sauce, so I was kind of sad to see that the wings at Sonora are pretty dry. They taste good, but they're just not as saucy as I'd like.\n\nIt's a cute place, and if I lived in Phoenix, I'd probably be a regular for beers and Kobe burgers. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK Mexican dishes. Not authentic but good and tasty. Quick fix if your in that neighborhood. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was stoked to try this place for lunch today. I just found out about it last week. Who knew this little gem was located Uptown? Ok, I guess people who work on that side of Uptown but I never knew it was there! Quick service but it took awhile to get our check. Luckily, one of the girls I was with knew the manager and she alleviated the issue. I love that they have sushi specials that come with soup or salad at a reasonable price. The sushi tasted fresh and the spicy tuna had my mouth burning which is a great thing. Their portions for lunch on the hot dishes looked ginormous so I will be checking that out next. In and out in less than an hour-good times. Two words for you Fujo---Sushi Buffet!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Can you believe we got a table on Valentines day? I'm an idiot since I don't celebrate holidays but Red Devil doesn't take reservation.\nI had the stand by spaghetti and italian sausage. My friend had lasagna.\nAs usual the service was excellent and the food delicious. The 40 minute wait went be quickly since we already had so much to talk about.\nThis is just a great local spot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!\n\nI came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..\n\nAs we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.\n\nWe stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.\n\nWhat a joke...\n\n**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We were there for New Years with friends and the atmosphere is second to none with panoramic views of the city.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Why can't all retailers follow the Nordstrom way of customer service?  On a saturday night I went in and bought a printer.  when I got home there was an email from best buy with a coupon of 15% of f the printer I had just purchased.  So Sunday--I get up, wait for the store to open--to see if they will simply make the adjustment over the phone--I called twice and the phone was never answered.  \n\nSo--I went on line to make sure  what the price should be when I go in to return and rebuy--as it turns out--the online price was less expensive than the store price plus the discount.  Anyway--to be on the safe side, I purchased on line with in store pick up--went over to the store.\n\nThe women in customer service says--when I say no one answered the phone when I called this morning--we were slammed--here we are in a technology store and they don't have the phone technology that allows you to leave a message?  I believe it is called voice mail.  And they were slammed at 10:15 on a Sunday morning--by 11--the store seemed pretty empty to me.\n\nAnyway--the women says--oh I will just give you the discount on the one you purchased and return the one you bought on line--but it turns out that the one on line was cheaper than the price in a store--I do not understand with the changing nature of shopping and retail stores desperate to get people in the door why you would do that?\n\nSomething that should have been handled by a phone call--cost me an hour of my time--no big deal in the scheme of things--but it could be so much better so easliy--with someone at Best Buy paying attention and following the Nordstrom way. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Go to Lindstroms on Indian School!!!!!!!!\n\nIts been 3 or 4 weeks since I last washed my car, so I took it to Danny's yesterday because the location was more convenient than Lindstroms - Trader Joes was on my to-do list.\n\nI had little mud splatters on one side of the car - somebody must have driven through a puddle while I was parked.  But I was getting the car washed for general reasons, not just because of the mud splatters, so I made the mistake of not looking closely after Danny and his Family were done washing.\n\nWhen I got back home, I noticed most of the little mud splatters were still there.  My first thought was \""sh%t, its paint and not mud\"" but I scraped one with my finger and it came right off.  And there are water spots all over one window, coffee and dust in the cup holder, etc etc.\n\nSo now I need to go back and argue with a manager, or pay again at Lindstroms.  I think I will pay again and go to Lindstroms - I've been a big fan ever since they got raided by the Country's Worst Sheriff:)  You get raided by Sheriff Joe, you must be doing something right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It seems that there are brunch people that don't mind a bit of chaos, while there are also those that prefer a bit more structure/order.  LGO caters to the former, while I am a member of the latter group.  Blasting this place would be unfair, since it's just not my type of brunch place.\n\nObjectively speaking, there was a ton of people there and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Parking was an f-ing hassle, as others have expressed.  The kitchen was rocking it, though.  The dry goods and wine selection seemed worthwhile.  Can't comment on the food or coffee...it was all too much to deal with, and had to get the hell out of there before I could order anything.\n\nIf you don't mind the high-energy brunch scene, this place is probably pretty good.  If you do, you might want to skip it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went to this Best Buy with the intention of looking at, and maybe buying a kick ass audio system for Christmas. Not a single person could be found to help me, standing there for over an hour. The store wasn't even busy. I was in the Magnolia section and the regular audio section. I went to find help, but there was very little to be found. The few kids who were working didn't even seem to notice I was there, and walked right by me several times . Oh well, I guess this is one reason Best Buy is in trouble. I'm taking my $$$ elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A wonderful place for lunch or a casual romantic dinner!  The salads and bruschetta trays are our favorites and the wine list is fabulous! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So, we were hungry after visiting the Heard Museum, and I had just found out I had $50 on my All Access card from the ridiculous amount of money we spend at the Honolulu Hard Rock a year and a half ago, so we decided to go.  It was a Sunday and downtown Phoenix was dead....as was the Hard Rock Cafe.  It just felt kind of depressing.  Service was a bit slow, my Margarita was blue and the food was so-so.  Then I found out the $50 on my card could not be used towards alcohol....which made up over 50% of our bill.  Oh well.  Had a lot more fun and the Honolulu one, but that's probably because we were on vacation.  :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place! The resturant is delicious. We waited awhile to get our food but it was worth the wait! Go there and expect to enjoy a delicious glass of wine while waiting to have a fabulous dinner! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The staff were condescending and outright rude. \n\nThe place smells of a dentist's office, they don't have that much variety in their product, and the prices are subpar.\n\nAfter getting snapped at by one of the workers when I asked if they had any 52mm lens caps (the place they're normally kept was out), I decided to wander around and observe their interactions with other customers. It was much of the same. I watched them deal out the same condescending attitude and impatience with other people who came in. \n\nI'm impressed they can stay in business, honestly. My recommendation: just go online... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I found out about this fine dining spot from a gift certificate I was given. Come dressed in your Sunday best and be prepared for some really good eats. Service was on point from the moment you walk in. My husband and I had dinner reservations so we were immediately seated. It was not crowded and the noise level was overall on the quiet side. I highly recommend getting their Prince Edward Island Steamed Mussels. It comes with ciabatta bread slices that you can dip into the mussel sauce for an extra treat. So much flavor and just the right amount to share where it won't get you full to enjoy your main entree. For dinner I had the Seared Sea Scallops and my husband ordered their Grouper special. Both dressed and plated French cuisine-style (small portions) so at first you're thinking, OMG this is it for so much $$$?! But we were both SO FULL, it was actually plenty to eat. To end the meal we chose the coconut cake with pineapple mango gelato which had a little kick of spice. The cake alone was incredible but paired with the gelato, DYNAMITE. Will definitely be ordering a full size of this cake with gelato for upcoming big parties we will host. This spot is perfect for a date or an intimate celebration. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK - I'll be honest... I LOVE their food (especially the sushi).  But their service can be REALLY bad.  I've had to re-order drinks multiple times, wait long times for a check at the table...  and most recently I tried to place a pick up order over the phone.  \n\nI asked to pick up my food in 1 hour, they asked why I was calling so far in advance... I explained that I was going to be in a meeting and couldn't call back in 30 minutes to place the order.  Their response was that they would have it ready in 20 minutes, but I didn't want my sushi sitting for another 40 minutes before I picked it up.  They said they couldn't guarantee to have it ready in an hour.  SERIOUSLY?  You're kidding, right?  So, I hung up and won't be doing that again.  I also cancelled my plans with a group of 14 friends to have dinner there this weekend... we're going to Stingray instead.  \n\nI've lost my patience with Moto.  Yea, the food is good - but the service is just so ridiculously bad... <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you can't find this place, it's because it's above Pamela's.  I liked all the crafts in here.  It was cute, lots of different things, colorful clothes, toy llamas, etc.  But, I really came here for the Peruvian food.\n\nIf you are looking for Papas a la Huancaina or ceviche, it isn't here.  It's salads, sandwiches, empanadas, and a few other entrees like arroz tapado.  \n\nThis is a good place for a healthy lunch but I would not come here for dinner.  After looking at the menu and nothing jumped at me, I got the empanada platter.  It was...ok.  Not that amazing.  I got the beef, the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas.  The cilantro wasn't even that prevalent in the chicken empanada.  My spinach empanada was comparable to a less flaky spanakopita.  The beef empanada need more flavor!  Sigh.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this place.\n\nI will say, the coffee was good and the server was very pleasant.  This is a nice place to get some cool gifts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went in over the weekend looking for a New York style breakfast. The meal exceeded all expectations. The bagels were fresh, the lox reminded of NYC and the ambiance was exactly what I was looking for. I love this place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I go to PCG mostly for the corn bread, black bean soup and Macadamia nut chicken. \n\nI tried the brunch menu for the first time today. Delish!! I had the highly-talked-about corn pancakes (w/ bacon). Served w/ real maple syrup, it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory! My friends had the breakfast enchiladas and the beef medallion eggs Benedict. Everything was very tasty! The price point is great too. Most of the dishes were $10.  \n\nHere's a tip: the tomatillo salsa served on the enchiladas has small bits of bacon in it. One friend is allergic to pork, and couldn't finish the dish once she discovered it. \n\nThis is a place with good food AND great service! I dine at PCG maybe every other month, but for some reason, I went a few times in a few weeks recently. Anyway, the guy that brings water to your table( before the server comes) not only brought the water but brought my \""usual\"" iced tea also.... I was so impressed!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A little pricey for what you get.  I got 3 dozen donuts, and it was $40!  Yikes!  Maybe they deserve 2.5 stars.\n\nI do like the NAME of the place, of course. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am SO mad at this store location today.  It is my son's 3rd birthday and I actually came into the store 10 days ago to order a Planes (the movie) themed birthday cake.  The woman at the counter took my order, my 2nd choice in case it wasn't in, and my phone number.  Nothing.  Until this morning, the day of his birthday.  I received a call saying that the cake was unavailable.  This is not how you should do business.  If the cake is not available today, it wasn't available 4-5 days ago.  GIVE A PERSON A CALL to let me know.  Luckily the Safeway on Chapparal was able to assist, and the cake was WONDERFUL!  \n\nPS - it wouldn't let me post ZERO stars... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Many will tell you this is the best burger in town. Im not sure if I would go that far (Black Dog and Crane Alley will give it a run for its money) but it definitely wont disappoint if you're looking for a BIG, tasty piece of beef between two buns.\n\nLocation is a little out of the way as it is basically in a basement in downtown Champaign. You will miss it if you are not looking for it. \n\nFries are very tasty. Service is good. Prices are a little steep for a burger. Solid place <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Should have known right away to get out of here after drive through woman had to ask whether they use white or dark meat in their chicken burrito. She assured me it was all white, but she was all-wrong as a giant piece of thigh meat spliled out of the poorly constructed item upon opening. This was one nasty burrito that went untouched. Crinkle cut fries were goo reheated, but that's about it from this taco hell hole. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to Mert's for lunch based off the reviews here and recommendations from coworkers.  I wasn't disappointed.  Mert's has an atmosphere that is trying to look like a dive diner, but comfortable and clean as well.  The atmosphere works well here.   I ordered the jumbo chicken wings with greens and mac-n-cheese as my sides.  The chicken wings were big and fried crispy, the greens were very tasty as was the mac-n-cheese.  The cornbread has to be some of the best I have ever had.  The greeens and mac-n-cheese were not the best I have ever had, but they were right up towards the top of my list.  The place was fairly busy as I expected and the service was OK.  I recieved my drink and food promptly, but my server never checked back.  I never really needed anything so I didn't suffer, but I can't give 5 stars because of that.  If you like good home cooked goodness then Mert's is the place to go. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was recommended this restaurant by a friend a year ago and I loved it when I first went. It is dimly lit and has a very romantic ambiance. The seared tuna, made medium-rare, was warm and crunchy on the outside due to the sesame encrusted skin but still retained a nice, raw non-fishy tuna taste on the inside. The drinks are also fairly priced. Especially a year ago, if I remember correctly, it was around ~$65 for Moet Champagne which was very cheap so we ended up getting two which I guess helped the night go by easier. The lounge got busier and more vibrant as our Friday night went on at Soba Lounge. If I reviewed it last year, I would've given this restaurant five stars.\n\nImpressed with my experience the first time, I went back again last Wednesday night. I still made a reservation on opentable but it was completely unnecessary since the restaurant was pretty empty. If that's the case I recommend you asking to be seated by the waterfall on the first floor. A bottle of Moet went up to $87 so I decided not to get it this time and moved straight to the food.\n\nI began the meal this time with calamari, followed by the tuna again with the bronzini (sea bass) for myself and ended the meal with a light honeycrisp apple pudding cake dessert. I'm not quite sure what the sauce was for the calamari but it didn't go quite well with the oversized fried squid. They were not bite-sized and I've never had to cut calamari before. Even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, I was surprised the chef was still able to undercook the ginger rice accommodating the Tuna dish to an inedible level. The waiter apologized and don't get me wrong, there was great service, but I still ended up paying full fare for half a meal. For that I had to drop the restaurant down one star.\n\nThere's a parking lot available right next to the restaurant but spaces are limited. Street parking around the neighborhood shouldn't be too hard to find too. <|endoftext|>

They were able to deliver the same day too! My Mother-in-law was very happy - she sent a picture of what we order- flowers looked fresh, with a nice assortment of flowers. Highly recommend this florist. (Order was placed from Delaware). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Im speechless. Simply, speechless. This place is AMAZING. I had pretty high expectations of this place and I was still blown away by the level of excellence this place carries. My amore and I decided to give this place a whirl on a Friday night, and we enjoyed every second of our experience. Upon arrival, we were told that there was an hour and a half wait, so we ventured into the bar area to have a glass of Prosecco, which was DELICIOUS by the way. About thirty minutes later, we were seated and looking over the menu. The wait was cut in half! I would have waited 6 hours for their bruschetta, though. We sampled four of their bruschetta selections, and not one piece was left behind. Their portions are large, and definately made for sharing. We topped off our scrumptious experience with an espresso and a salted caramel sundae. Im pretty sure my tastebuds are still dancing around.....As far as the service goes, it needs help. Our server was horrible. He refilled our water glasses ONCE and relied on other staff members to bring us our check. At the beginning of our visit, we were greeted by the owner, and he personally brought us a wine list, took our drink order, AND opened our vino, table side. That is so refreshing to see when the owner of a place puts his own elbow grease into maintaining his business. This place has an amazing, simple menu. Its an ideal place to take a date!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We've been staunch supporters of Hillstone for years, bringing many guests as well as special events to their tables.  Lately, I am saddened to say, there has been a gradual decline.  The wonderful soups are gone and our favorite, the Thai salad, was full (and I mean full!) of peanuts and tonight, no mint.  And the brownie has shrunk, though the price did not (when mentioned to the hostess, I was told this downsizing was the result of some NY regulation--WHAT??)  Regrettably, not the only examples.\nThis place was OUR PLACE for notable meals--great venue, sterling service and consistent meals.  While the venue is still top notch and the service is timely and professional, the food is waning.  We'll be taking our restaurant money elsewhere--it's like losing a good friend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Free wi-fi, tv and reading materials while you wait, which is really nice to offer. Price is competitive for the type of wash, however they seem to take great care when doing windows and interior once truck comes out of conveyor.  The fifth star is earned by the shoeshine that is also offered while you wait. I'm a sucker for old school service like that and love this place for it. They also have a check-in discount which is also kinda awesome. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ok...I know I may cause a ruckus with my next musing....\nMatt's Big Breakfast or Taylor's Cafe?  Long lines or easy seating?  Crowded, on-top-of -you, loud atmosphere or just loud?  Ordinary food with buzz or ordinary food without the buzz? Easy pick for me -- Taylor's Cafe over Matt's Big Breakfast.  \n\nI love breakfast!  I do.  And, more than that, I love comfort food breakfast's -- no foo foo gourmet breakfast for me -- save that for dinner.  I think Taylor's Cafe is just fine.  Plus - they know how to cook \""crispy\"" bacon. You have to ask for it - but it never comes out burnt.  They have interesting omlettes too if you are in the mood.  And you know what?  For a girl who likes a thick stack of french toast - I really like their oatmeal.  Odd, right?  Well it's darn good with fresh fruit on top.    \n\nSo, while Talyor's Cafe may not have the buzz of a Matt's Big Breakfast - I think the food satisfies my craving and I never have to wait in line.  When the weather gets cooler, go on Sunday, bring your New York Times (sorry-that's the East Coaster in me coming out) and sit out on the patio.\n\nService is adequate, but not outstanding.  I'm giving my rating to the food and atmosphere. <|endoftext|>

I just am not ready to turn into her.\n\nSo, it was time to get the convertible I have been talking about buying for YEARS.  After an online search through countless dealer sites, I came across my Saab convertible on the website for Lund Cadillac Hummer & Saab.  The high-def photos on their web site had me thinking I was looking at photos from a car show.  I called that same day to inquire about the one I wanted.\n\nThe internet sales manager, Frank Barela is great! He brought the car to me the next day (on my lunch hour!) for a test drive and made sure that all my questions we answered and needs met.  There was no hassle in the buying process and Frank made certain I was comfortable with my decision. \n\nOf course, the car had major selling points but the attentiveness and service level made my decision easy.  I am confident that my decision to buy from Lund (...and Frank) was the right one.  Every time I get a compliment on my car, I mention Lund and my experience. Thank you, Frank Barela! I love my Saab! <|endoftext|>

Cool toys, gadgets, technological marvels, entertainment devices, smarter phones, music players, happiness, love, laptops, all-in-one desktops, sexiness, software, high-powered portable speakers, oh so many shiny things, and a bar where they apparently sell geniuses!  I'll take two!\n\nIf I wasn't such a technology whore, then I might not love all the devices with retina displays, touch IDs, and such intuitive and badass capabilities.  But I am.  And I do.  \n\nThe overall experience is quick and painful. You can purchase $20 iPhone case or a $2,500 MacBook Pro with the help of one person who will find what you want and ring you up with a mini portable register device.  \n\nApple is just a cool gotta-have-it brand... and I gotta have it! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After filing my complaint on Sunday, I was told  I would receive a follow up by Monday. It is now Thursday and the company has continued to give me the runaround. I have been given multiple phone #s to call, every person I speak to makes me repeat the entire situation and then tells me to call another person. I finally got the number to who I was told was the General Manager but is actually the Fleet Manager only to get a full voicemail box. Probably filled with similar complaints... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped by this bar because a friend knows the owner. The patrons were nice and the bar tender was fantastic. I gave it one star because the owner  (little dude) and his wife (drunk with an attitude) really don't care about their patrons. Not a good experience for non-locals and I would not suggest this bar. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  went there for a working lunch with the marketing department. ordered a salad. started eating, it was okay- tasted like a crappy hooters chicken salad. THEN I NOTICED... a small pearly yellow orange bean looking thing in the salad. i poked it with my fork and then lifted it to my nose to smell it. IT WAS A CHEWED UP PEACH JELLY BELLY JELLYBEAN! IN MY SALAD! i was disgusted. told the waiter, showed it to him and he LAUGHED, as if that was a funny joke between buddies. \n\ncan you picture the fat lady in the back mixing up my salad and a chewed up jellybean from her bag falls into my plate and she just keeps going or doesn't notice?!?! i had to actually request that the salad be taken off of my bill - they were still going to charge me for it.\n\nthey offered nothing else, no manager came over to talk to me, nothing... as if it was just another customer complaint. lol NEVER GOING BACK THERE! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Heartfelt thanks to Moda Fina for giving such special care to my mothers 35 year old wedding ring.  It had a broken prong and was quite dirty.  They fixed the prong, buffed up the ring and cleaned the diamond and its setting.  It looks like a brand new ring (and she said, \""Is that my wedding ring?\"")!  Lori is an absolute angel and couldn't have been anymore wonderful or helpful. <|endoftext|>

He always remembers my name and calls me the cutest pet names.  Always happy to freshly squeeze my OJ (what a man haha) and knows I need my huge cup of hot brimming coffee.  \n\nToday, I was craving an egg/bacon/jalape\u00f1o/salsa with no cheese burrito.  It was perfectly cooked and juicy (yum)! Instead of their perfectly browned hash browns (the longing can you feel it lol); I had fresh fruit which was great.  \n\nOnce again, love JC for his attentiveness & always feeling he looks forward to seeing me.  Rest of staff and the food is always fab! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped by Hinkley's yesterday to look for a light for our bathroom remodel. I've also been eying the very cool paper star lights they hang in their windows as I drive past on my way to work each day. \n\nI was in the place 15 minutes and was not greeted once. There seemed to be only one gal working at the time (with a customer), but not even a \""Hi there!\"" \n\nThe shop has BEAUTIFUL lights, but the $650 one I loved is a bit out of my price range. Ok, WAY out of my price range. Even the paper stars were $30-40. Boo. \n\nMaybe there's a pocket of richies in Central Phoenix that can afford Hinkley's...but even if I could, I am turned off to shop here again....a simple \""hello\"" would have been nice. <|endoftext|>

Yes, hipster service isn't going to walk up to you all bubbly and smiley and be super cheesy to you. But the employees are chill, and it's all about the food, milkshakes, and coffee. The rotating menu is awesome, and I've tried a lot and never gotten anything bad. The chai milkshakes are amazing, as are all of their drinks. I'm not even a vegetarian and this one of my favorite places to go over and over! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I so badly want a Chicago style Italian beef joint near my house - and though I live just a few blocks away  - Luke's of Chicago is not it. \n\nI've been here twice - each time brimming with optimism at the hope of getting an approximation of the real deal.  Both times I was treated to hard, stale bread, bland meat, flavorless jus, burnt greasy fries.\n\nI am sure my craving will return at some point - and because LOC is the closest thing in the area, I am sure I will be tempted.  I am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Dear Karim, \n\nI was sooo excited to find your place. My BFF's favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe, so for her Christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant. We planned this before Christmas and your website stated that you were open 11am-2pm and that worked perfectly for us. So on Sunday Jan 3rd we arrived at your place at 1:15pm, appetite in tow, craving what you had to offer and you know what ? You were closed??? No freakin explanation.. nothing! Your sign even had the audacity to say open \""11am - ??\"" Really? WTF kind of crap is that? If you're going to be so casual about your signage, why don't you update your website to mirror your lax hours of operation. You completely ruined the day and her Christmas present which we were both looking forward to. We ended up going to Hard Rock, satisfied yet still disappointed by the day's events. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had this on my TO DO list for a very long time. Glad I finally visited. I went for the Sunday Music in the Park, which was nice, so was the BBQ & wine. Walking through & seeing all the amazing glass sculptures was awesome. So got a 3-4-1 experience: garden, glass, concert.  I would highly recommend to see before the glass exhibit is gone! I can't see it being anywhere near as fantastic otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was headed to TeePee, but at the last moment had a change of heart. I decided to go for a new Italian place, and this small restaurant caught my eye. Very small dining room, with nice tables positioned so you can sit close to your date. I had the prosciutto and melon, which came served as a single slice of Cantaloupe sitting on a bed of prosciutto. It was OK, but I was not a fan of the presentation. For my entree I had the Veal Parm, and it was sub-par. It felt like a chicken fried steak. The wine selection was nice, but not anything noteworthy. I noticed three servers, only one of which actually fielding questions, the other two in charge of bread and busing only. I would have preferred a darker, more intimate atmosphere, but it was not bad. The bill for two came to approx $80. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many spots to check out before this place deserves a second visit. Nice if this is your neighborhood Italian spot for a mid-week meal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could give a negative 5 this would be it they could not make fries could not make sundaes got the total wrong gave the wrong change shorting me $5.00 could not provide a receipt DO NOT come here <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The last time I dined here was many years ago. I recalled it being a \""decent\"" dining experience then, but one I wasn't exactly enthusiastic about repeating again during a recent visit with friends. As another poster mentioned, there is a small segment of the population who is rabidly devoted to this long time Phoenix fixture. Why? I'm not exactly sure. My most recent experience, days ago, left me wondering how this place has managed to stay open for so long.\n\nUpon entering the dark, cavernous entrance, no one was there to greet us. It took a while before someone noticed and seated us. The dining area on this very hot afternoon, was uncomfortably warm. Not exactly a respite from the heat.\n\nThen the salsa and chips arrived. Please see the photos and other reviews on this awful concoction which appears to me to be nothing more than tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce base) with a few chili pepper seeds thrown in for good measure. This stuff absolutely comes from a can. If you ask for the \""other salsa\"", what appears next is a watery, minced pepper mixture that is horribly bland and only slightly better than the tomato sauce salsa. I wound up eating the chips by themselves.\n\nI ordered a chicken burro enchilada style. The rice was fine, the shredded chicken abundant, but not seasoned. The enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless. \n\nAll in all, highly disappointing and completely non-authentic. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I got a pedicure for $30 and it was exceptional! Great for the price. It included a hot stone massage, calf massage, and the nail technician did excellent work. I love Myles Nails and the other review was not deserved. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Despite a bad experience, I will still give this palace a trial.\n\nFirst, it's reasonably authentic foods if you ask for the \""black\"" menu to order the real Szechwan foods. Second, it helps if you know the waiter and he can prepare something totally off the menu (only if you know what you wants obviously).\n\nI have been here with various groups of mixed friends. They have all enjoyed it.\n\nI enjoy spicy foods... not a must in all dishes but only if it compliments the taste. I usually gun for the water boiled dishes. In the recent past, I had ordered a simple dish Ma Po Tofu. it's spicy hot but it's also VERY salty. After 2 bites, the water tasted like sea water for a day. I don't think it's supposed to be made that way. Maybe they screwed it up in the kitchen.\n\nMy most recent visit with friends, we had water boiled fish, stirred fried egg plants, and lamb with cumin (not really on the menu). We all enjoyed it. The water boiled fish was toned down on spice for unknown reason. I did not burn my tongue by the salt content. We enjoyed the experience.\n\nThe ambiance is usually nice... very bright and clean. The deco is of modern Chinese. The waiters have been reasonably attentive during most visits.\n\nDiners, if you want authentic Szechwan foods, go for the Black. Once you go Black, you won't go back, only in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you're 16 this will probably be right up your alley.  The servers are all young, cute girls but haven't properly been trained.  I went here with friends and ordered a couple of cheese steaks and grilled chicken salad,  both of our steaks were cold by the time they arrived and the chicken was raw.  We told the waitress and she said...oh I'm sorry but that was it.  I don't think the kitchen staff cares what they turn out because they are chasing the girls.  It's gone down hill lately and it's sad because I live in the neighborhood.  I won't go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Oh shit!  Literally.  \n\nI was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.  The first thing we noticed was that there weren't any dishes.  It was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use.  Then the place started to smell bad... and then we noticed the waste water bubbling up from the floor drains behind the salad bar.  It was like something out of a horror movie.  We left in a hurry... a drainage grate in the parking lot was flowing with more raw sewage.  It was amazingly gross.  \n\nAny good experiences I've ever had in this place are moot... I'm never going back to this location again. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I took some customers to Capital Grille this week.  Actually getting to the restaurant was difficult, at least for me, and I am pretty familiar with Uptown Charlotte.  Every turn that I needed to take was forbidden by either \""no left turn\"" or \""no right turn\"" signs.  I had to end up going several blocks out of my way and ultimately doing an illegal turn to get to the restaurant.\n\nFinding parking is sort of difficult, as well.  From what I understand, Valet parking does not start until 6:00pm and I got to the restaurant at about 5:30pm.  I would recommend parking in the garage for the office building next door to the restaurant.  Capital Grille will validate your parking if you park there.\n\nThe food is very good, but also fairly expensive.  I had 8 people in my group and our total bill was right at $1,100.00 including tip.  This did include two bottles of mid-priced wine, though.  I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and it was very good.  As far as sides, I would recommend the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and Au Gratin Potatoes.  We also got the seafood appetizer platter and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The desserts are large and very tasty. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really cheap, & really quick! As mentioned before, the barbers do listen to you & cut your hair just the way you ask them. \n\nOnly drawback, if you see it as such, is that they specialize  in just traditional cuts (buzz cut, crew cut, etc). Nothing too edgy or crazy\n\nThis is a cash only place, so don't forget the $10! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DOWNRIGHT RUDE. Three best words to explain what a horrific experience I had at this Danny's for the first (and most definitely last) time this last Tuesday. I had just gotten my car back from the shop and decided to get a full interior detail done. I live right off 16th and highland so it was a convenient choice. Well boy was I the fool to think 80 bucks would get me a somewhat decently clean car....to my shock it was actually WORSE then before I went in and wasted my money. They actually took a small contained coffee stain in the back seat and somehow spread the stain all over my cloth seats, w/ some of the stain moved onto the front passenger seat!! It was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car. There was a huge soap stain on the interior windshield, spilled sticky soda stains UNTOUCHED in the drink consul and on top of all of that, they soaped up my tires randomly (I didn't even buy an exterior wash) which irritated me as I pointed out to one idiot who remarked, \""oh it's to make them look shiny\"" with an imbecile grin. HELLOO!!! Why not focus on the interior and actually get it done RIGHT?!? Utterly pathetic. I am still angry w/ myself for wasting my hard earned money to this joke of a business. I was so upset I took it back and the men who worked on my car the first time were all there and just stared at me with the rudest glares. Had the guy w/ the tattoos all over his head and face redo it, who actually did a little better. It's amazing this place is still in business let alone always so busy when I drive by, must be all new-timers about to be screwed out of their money...80 dollars down the drain, for a job my two year old daughter could have done better. The raids shouldn't have stopped with the illegals, should have arrested all of the LAZY WORKERS AND STAFF AS WELL!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Reservation for 2 on a Saturday made with ease.  Maybe a warning sign. Valet parking was easy, as there was a basketball game, so Charlotte was busy.  The jazz ensemble was playing when we walked in.  Pretty cool - so far.  It took me a while, but I realized after a while that the inside of this place reminds me of a restaurant you would find inside of a Radisson in a medium sized city.  A restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and mostly from a buffet (not that there's a buffet, here) - I'm speaking about the (lack of) atmosphere.  It was also very loud.  I couldn't really hear the jazz band, just a large amount of noise.  \n\nOh, yeah, the food.  I ordered the Antipasti, and my wife ordered the Pumpkin She Crab Soup.  Those were both pretty good.  My wife ordered a glass of wine, and the pour was pretty minimal.  Look - we get it, we're not going to make the restaurants night on liquor.  I didn't order alcohol, and my wife only ordered a glass - but it was below the 1/4 full mark.  Pretty lame.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the lamb, which is a specialty, and my wife ordered the chicken stuffed with mushrooms and mascarpone.  We would never normally order chicken at a restaurant, but glad we did.  It saved the meal.  It was really good.  The lamb, however, was a stew, with veggies and such in a large pot.  It is as advertised.  It lacked a lot in the flavor department.  \n\nOne word of warning.  If you get the sea bass, it is filleted table side.  The couple (right) next to us ordered it, and it smelled, and looked kind of gross.  It kind of set me off for the rest of the meal.  \n\nDesserts were good.  I ordered the brownie topped with raspberry semifreddo, and she ordered the salted carmel pudding.  Both were OK - but not awesome.  We also had to wait for coffee.  \n\nThe service was ok, but not great.  Our waters weren't refilled but once.  \n\nI waffle between 2 stars and 3.  I think the best way to describe it is, we wouldn't go back unless some good friends really wanted to go there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Place way over priced <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! \n\nWhile Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!\n\nI split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!\n\nThe only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! \n\nI think there's some other stuff on the menu, but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Being a Chicago guy, I can't say enough about how much I enjoy an Italian Beef Sandwich from Lukes. They're exactly like what I used to eat growing up. Put the peppers on them if you know how to eat one right. \n\nThe place is as Chicago as it gets. If you order a hot dog with everything on it, they don't include ketchup unless you specifically ask. Their supplier is Vienna Beef, and they even have the neon green relish. The fries are even the exact the same as the Chicago locations. \n\nThe place is also very Chicago themed. Pictures and posters of the Windy City and its sports teams surround you. And if stop by during a Cubs game, rest assured it will be playing on the TV. \n\nThe prices are the one big negative that keeps me from driving over to Luke's more often. Although the food tastes great, and is worth the value for an occasional trip, it's a lot of money for greasy fast food.  But if you're looking for an authentic Chicago hot dog or Italian Beef in Phoenix, hit up Luke's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's been a long time since I went to a Lone Star (no offense-just not really on my radar) and will probably be an even longer time before I go back. While the service was adequate our server didn't really interact with us-she was sort of like a zombie server and just showed up to take our order, bring us our drinks and bring us our card back. Don't get me wrong-I'm not looking for a bestie at my table but the only thing drier was the steak-my friend ordered a filet and I a San Antonio Sirloin. Our meats were tough and dry-so much so that we barely ate half and didn't even bother to bring it home. Next time I'll find an Outback or TX Roadhouse (my friend likes chain steakhouses-I like the independents but am happy to compromise). The sweet potato was smaller then the cinnamon and sugar served on top. My salad, though tiny-was spot on! Do yourself a favor and pass on this place. Your pallet and wallet will appreciate it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BEWARE: The owner makes all of the staff pay for their mistakes.\n\nIf a mistake occurred, pay special attention to your bill, because the waitress may add on the additional charges without your knowledge. Make sure it's itemized or you'll end up paying for their mistake(s). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.\n\nThe place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.\n\nNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.\n\nI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.\n\nOh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been taking my son here for 7 years now. The entire staff is always attentive, they typically have appointments available when you call and your child is sick and their physicals have always been very thorough.\n\nI love they have two sides to the their office - sick door and healthy door. They also have Saturday hours at their other location, so that is useful if you need them. \n\nThey do a lot of newborn/new parent education. \n\nThe doctors and staff are always friendly, they truly do like what they do and they do a great job. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I absolutely cannot recommend strongly enough against this hotel. I wish I'd read these reviews before deciding to stay here. The entire second floor smells like cat urine and our room in particular (201) is almost unbearable. The carpet has been damp since we checked in and unfortunately we're here 2 nights. Stay somewhere else, please!\n\nOn the plus side, my daughter enjoyed the indoor pool and the lobby/breakfast area are clean enough. This in no way makes up for the horrible stench of this place. I feel dirty just being here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First things first: the house BBQ sauce is fabulous. I love that it isn't just the regular brown house made goop that most BBQ joints serve. You can actually see and taste all the different spices/herbs!! Like I said, fabulous. \n\nI went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9\n\nAt $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!\n\nYelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!\n\nTip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open spaces around lunch or dinner time.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is good here, quite good actually. I give it two stars because it is far too expensive for what it is. I speculate that the high prices are to cover the overhead on the large (in sq. ft.) restaurant area, or maybe they use really high-quality ingredients in some dishes and spread the cost of those over their cheaper dishes. I say this b/c I have only gotten pretty simple stuff like pad thai, tom ka, and curries from them (no fancy fish or meat) and have always felt that I overpaid by at least 50%. \n\nIMHO, Nothing about this place justifies the excessive prices (though the dope mural outside comes close). The quality of the food is about on par with or slightly higher than Thara Thai, but the prices are nearly double. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It's hard to find a good auto repair place where you won't get taken advantage of.  Because of the great reviews on Yelp, I drove out of my way to take my car to Chet's.  I'm a young woman with an old car that I didn't want to put a lot of money into.  I just need my car to last me another year or so until I can afford a new one.  I dropped by Chet's without an appointment or anything, and one of the mechanics came out to the parking lot to take a look at my car right away (free of charge).  He actually got on the ground to peak under my car, and he knew what the problem was in less than a minute.  He answered all my questions, and I arranged to bring my car back the next day to get fixed.  When I brought my car in to get fixed, the guy at the front desk recognized me right away and slipped me a coupon from their ad for 10% off my services because he knew that I didn't want to put a lot of money into my car.  I was taken aback by his thoughtfulness.  The mechanics kept me informed as they were working on my car, gave me the estimate, gave me their opinion, and answered all my questions.  All around great service at a reasonable price. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  To put this review in context, I was looking for a meal in the same vein as Ruth's Chris's or Morton's steakhouse.  Having eaten at Houston's (in Houston), I thought this would be a great place to get a steak.  I was probably shooting a little high.  Service was good, but there were issues with the food.  First off they ran out of baked potatoes, not a big deal but perhaps a little foreshadowing?  The Steak came out with no red in the center, probably a solid medium.  The redone steak came out a little more pink (not red), but still did not have the deep, meaty flavor I was craving.  The Fish sandwich we ordered was good, as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides.  In other words, I would come back here for lunch (the fish sandwich), but not the steak.  I can't comment on the sushi, maybe this is what they are concentrating on.  I would not avoid this place, but it certainly isn't worth going out of my way to visit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I dont understand some of the negative reviews for the staff of this place, since they have always been nice and helpful. I dont know if they were expecting 5 star restaurant service, but they do the best part time workers in their 20s can do.\n\nNow, the UIUC campus has several Espresso Royales (Union, UGL, BIF, Urbana, etc) but this is the best place, both in taste and service. It has a great environment too, with a sort of 'open' basement with the staircase in the middle of the building. \n\nThey have in the back of the room cups and pitchers with ice water, almost like a true Viennese cafe! And tasting the capuccino here taught me that you really dont need to go to some fancy place like Pekara, Cafe Kopi, or Caffe Bene for the best capuccinos. \n\nMuch better than Starbucks, I might add, this coming from a loyal Starbucksite for over 5 years of daily Starbucks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place sucks. The wait staff  took a long time to get to my table, which was weird as it was not particularly packed that day. Overall, I had to wait nearly an hour between time of order to time of serving. Don't go there unless you are very patient. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is just great! We have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has been great every time. It is so cheap and you always get so much food and so\nfast to. They have a huge menu which is awesome! The workers are always so happy and take good care of you! They just remodeled it and it looks so nice inside and the bathrooms are always clean. Great place! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We saw great reviews on Yelp and decided to try this place out. It looked a little iffy with its strip mall location but we decided to throw caution to the wind. \n\nAfter sitting down our drink order was promptly taken and filled. After waiting a while (a bit too long), our order was taken. While we were exact in our order, the waiter fumbled and made mistake. We called the mistake to the waiter's attention and he said that this would be taken off the bill. It was not. \n\nThe sushi was C grade. Passable but not anything I would return for. \n\nOur order came with a green salad that resembled bagged salad. The miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it. Quite surprising and added nothing spectacular to the dish. \n\nMy ramen was poorly executed, with undercooked noodles and only a few pieces of meat floating in it. I was really disappointed as I have had really great ramen at a handful of other restaurants around the country. I was looking forward to this japanese staple, but sadly left most of it in my bowl. \n\nI find it odd that this restaurant serves both italian and japanese food, Maybe if they focused on one type of food the flavor and presentation would improve. \n\nWe will not be returning. <|endoftext|>

Drink-S/S-entries-desert/icecre-bread\n Realy? Dont be Cheap scate. Dont forget to to TIP. you get all this food and the server has to RUN their ass off for you. \nFor those thinking about working here, be prepaired to wear your running shoes. If this place were any faster, they would have drive through. \nNo shit\n\nThe tips suck\n The guest are broke, or old. They're here for a cheap feeding. \nAt lunch all the guest want to be in and out in 30-45. Be prepaired to not make shit in tips.\n\nFor any guest reading this, you should remember what TIPs stands - to (in) sure promt service.\nIf you cant afford to tip, you sgouldnt be going out for full service dinning. \n\nFor thoes who are critical about the food??? For Christ sakes -- look at the prices. Your not gonna get 4-5 star food for what your paying for. \nLastly - why dont those of you who bring your kids, why do you allow them to to MAKE SUCH A MESS.  Thats disgusting and makes tje servers job harder. \nAND - YOU SHOULD TIP ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH YOU ATE.  The menu certainty doesnt reflect the true value of how hard your server worked to keep you satisfied. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Everything I've tried so far (Shrimp w/Garlic Sauce, Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Empress Chicken, Beef w/Chicken and Vegetables, and Veggie Fried Rice) has been delicious, except for the Buddha's Delight, which was...meh (I'm not a squishy-tofu fan--ya gotta firm that shit up!).  \n\n1 point was deducted for the fact that EatCU.com says you can order from them online, but Rainbow Garden says you cannot.  ....?!  So, don't try that--you'll probably never get your food.  The delivery of the food was also kind of ridiculous (that is, the delivery guy told me to come meet him on the street instead of coming up to where I'm located, and when I did, I found out he'd come upstairs instead), and one of the dishes was missing.  \n\nIn sum: Sketchy service, but it's made up for by the tasty, tasty food. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left.\n\nI do love one thing; Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My husband is military and was in town for a one month language course nearby, so he booked a military rate king suite which includes a pull-out sofa bed, two flat screen tvs, a separate bedroom from living area, and  mini fridge, microwave, and sink. \n     He's a Hilton Honors member, so the 4th floor was where our room is. The elevator clearly marks the 4th floor as the designated to HHonors members. Not sure why it matters, but just FYI in case you prefer a lower level. \n    Upon check in, my husband was given a goodie bag, their notorious cookies, and 11 beverage vouchers for the attached restaurant and bar: The Belvedere. \n    Each day booked includes a nice complimentary breakfast buffet. They offer a nice spread of fresh cut fruit, cereals, oatmeal, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, muffins, various breads, coffee, hot tea, juices, and milk. \n     They feature Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries which have a nice clean scent and lather well. \n      The only oddity I noticed was that from our room, the ice and vending machines were a bit of a trek. But, not that big of a deal. \n       The pool was well maintained, stocked with towels warmed by the Arizona sun, and a courtesy phone by the hot tub to request pool side food and/or beverages. \n       Mind you, they do have a shuttle, but there aren't a lot of dining options within walking distance. If you yelp nearby restaurants,  most are located within the airport. The on site restaurant is a little pricey, but the food is good. \n       Overall, we enjoyed our stay and had no issues. Love the beds, but not a fan of down pillows. (No neck support) Customer service was friendly and efficient. Would recommend for a moderately priced hotel near the airport, with beyond the basic amnenities. <|endoftext|>

( take me with you) You put up with two loud birthday gals and a large bunch of drunk woman walking into your very small, neighborhood bar at midnight. Every head turned when we walked in. It is a pretty small place. teehee! (Just an FYI, not all of us were drunk, but maybe we were, Hmmmmmmmmm??? Insert pinkie to the side of the mouth style) \n\nJust kidding.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Got kicked out of Fridays First Row! What a bunch of pieces of craps! We only had 2 rounds of drinks there, we weren't being loud or obnoxious, the place was practically empty and the manager couldn't give us a satisfactory answer as to why we were being dismissed. The only thing he kept repeating was \""I have to back his bartenders.\"" WTF?! It's cool to have a manager to back you up like this but c'mon guy! YOU didn't even notice anything out of the ordinary from our group, you were right there!!! WE WERE NOT DRUNK OR LOUD! \n\nEven thought that was our last drink there, it still pissed us off. Needless to say, they didn't deserve a tip and we took our business to a place that appreciates having a good group of day drinkers at their empty establishments on a slow Saturday afternoon. In downtown Phoenix, it wasn't hard to find the next spot...\n\n*** Da Bafroom: Sorry folks, we were not there long enough to make this visit.  But I'm sure it stinks just as bad as the serivce we got though! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I developed my 120 film here the other day, and they charged me an extra 4 dollars a roll for no reason.  On the website they say $8 but they charged me $12.  The owner is very pretentious and rude.  When I told him that it says 8 dollars online he didn't care at all.  When I dropped my film off the high school kid didn't even tell me the price because \""it is too much for me to calculate\""  Also, the photo equipment, darkroom equipment and film are way over priced.  I am never going back to this place.  I strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with Bernie's Photo.  Rather, use the websites of companies like B&H, Adorama, or Calumet.  The have MUCH better customer service and better prices.  Very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city. <|endoftext|>

A late black woman who somehow plays the role of hostess is rude and doesn't care that they messed up and didn't log your reservation. The food is bland, and the pasta is overcooked and/or nuked. Furthermore, the COOKS got into a fist fight. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been trying to snag a good table at Upstream on RW for the past year! Finally, I nabbed one! There was six in our party and we had a 7:30 reservation. This was the first night we had left our newborn daughter at home with a sitter and the whole ride there I was thinking \""I hope this is worth it!\"".... Oh my gosh! It was!!!! I ordered a pineapple mojito and promptly finished it due to the fact that it was absolutely delectable!!! (And had another, of course) the RW was wonderful and extremely varied. I ordered the crab cakes and WOW! Fantastic party of flavor on my palate! Oh! SO! Good! Next was the ahi tuna on this rice cake thing--- um.... Holy smokes! Amazing!!!!! The ponzu sauce just completed it!!!!! Bryan had the flounder which was prepared perfectly over incredible risotto...... Yummy choice as well! Dessert was ok although I should have ordered a third mojito. :) truly, this restaurant is definitely a place to enjoy apps and entrees. Go grab dessert at Pinkberry's afterwards. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been convinced to re-write my review for this particular Walmart.  \n\nThe previous review I wrote was pretty bad.  So allow me to begin again.\n\nThis Walmart location is one of the teeny tiny, original designs.  The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina. <|endoftext|>

My insurance company paid them and I paid my copay for one office visit.  So far I've wasted two hours proving the $100 office visit has been paid in full 8 months ago.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:\n\nIsland Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.\n\nCamarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.\n\nMaduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?\n\nMojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.\n\nMarquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.\n\nOther worthy options: \nArroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!\n\nFritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!\n\nCalypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.\n\nSun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!\n\nDatiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.\n\nEmpanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.\n\nTamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.\n\nFlan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.\n\nFree Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!\n\nAs you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Can't wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind, I tried my food.  I must admit it was good.  Not great, but good.  I didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  I dig that kind of place.  But if you tell someone a time, you should be able to deliver.  The food itself warrents a higher rating, but the overall experience was a disappointment. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The price for a 2 bed room with a TV, radio, desk, and lounge chair is  over $125 per night (no fridge, no microwave). The appearance of the room is not pleasant (peeling wallpaper, poor paint, visible water damage in the room). The room appears to have last been updated prior to my birth (1980's). Upon arrival, a housekeeper was notified that the lamp in our room did not work. She replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up. Nobody came.  Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3:44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests!  There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning. If you don't get one of those, you'll have to pay ten dollars for a mediocre breakfast bar. \n\nThis part deserves it's own paragraph. The smell of this facility is that of an angry, unbathed gladiator suffering the heat of a Roman sun mixed with the excretions of baby post-sweet potato. You've been warned. The air handling is so terrible, I truly cannot warn you enough. I am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench. Particularly worrisome is that the stink is worst in a stairwell. If the dirty smoke detectors ever went of with warning of impending doom, that doom may be more so from the stairwell stink (remember not to play in elevators during a fire!) than the fire. \n\nThe pool is nice! <|endoftext|>

Actually, this one is located right in front of the Sheraton Hotel in the Arizona Center, which was the closest place with sports games and beer.

But I have always been a little skeptical about the bar(I am a drinker) and the premise under which they exist. They offered no food for sale today, and in fact a customer ordered Chinese food on his cell phone to be delivered to the pub so that he  could eat dinner. The barmaid sat at the bar the whole time I was there...smoking and chatting up her buds. Avoid at all cost. Had to ask for a drink each time, and for the check.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This store is too busy. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mac more than anything but the service at this store is god-awful. Luckily before purchasing my Mac I researched until I knew exactly what I wanted. I seemed to know more than the associate that helped me! Purchasing it was more of an awkward affair - I couldn't wait to get out of there. \n\nAlso, it's always almost impossible to get into the Genius Bar. My iPod malfunctioned sometime earlier this year and after waiting in the store for 45 minutes to be seen, I was only informed that the damages were more in depth than they thought and I would need to schedule an appointment. It's just an iPod, people! The experience itself was more than frustrating. I stick with Amazon on this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If you're a picky sushi eater, don't waste your time here... it may be cheap, but the service and quality reflect that.\n\nSomehow, I managed to spend about $25 on my dinner there tonight, even with happy hour pricing.  I know, it's not so bad for sushi... but the service was extremely off, and the sushi was just meh.\n\nI'd been before and I'm sure I'll go again, just with the expectations in check next time.\n\nI shared an order of yellowtail sashimi, an I also had a seaweed salad (it was violet in color - have you ever seen that before?), a scallop handroll (generous in serving size but way too creamy for my liking), and an order of ikura.  \n\nWe sat in the bar area... it was fine for a casual dinner with friends, but nothing fancy at all.  There are much better sushi places to choose from - even in AZ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been to Moto several times as it's right down the street from me, and it's my go-to when I want average sushi and a Happy Hour drink. The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine, but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries. \n\nI use the term \""competently\"" because it's by no means great food. The sushi is average, at best, but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant. This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu, but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment. \n\nMy one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating. I asked for a regular salmon roll once though, and was told that they only have the smoked salmon that comes in the Philly Roll. A sushi restaurant that doesn't carry raw salmon?! You've got to be kidding me, I hope that my server was just uninformed because that's pretty inexcusable otherwise. \n\nI wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour, because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times. <|endoftext|>

With all the awesome donuts in this town, why would you sell \""yesterday's donuts at today's prices?\""  Won't be returning there for any baked products as I have no idea when they may have been baked.  The woman that works at the counter is very sweet, I wanted to support this local business, sadly, I cannot. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Would recommend to not offer a Groupon if you can't answer your phone or return a bloody text message. 3 attempts and nothing. Even went in there to make an appointment. Was given a card and told to call for an appointment. Sure, that worked,. This was counterproductive and a colossal waste of time!\n\nPerhaps you can extend some professionalism and honor your offer. Fortunately, Groupon credited my account. Buyer beware! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you order sushi, ask for the secret menu.  The regular menu has regular rolls (standard stuff like Spicy Tuna and things of that sort).  We usually go for sushi, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the appetizers and the bowls.  The wings are very good (boneless, skinless tenders in sauce).  \n\nThe best part is the beer selection.  It's rotated regularly and is always unique.  The bartender is always friendly and quick to suggest a good beer if the taps have changed since my last visit.\n\nReally a good place to go have happy hour or dinner.  We actually started going there when we lived down the street.  We've since moved, but we still drive out of our way to go there.\n\nZen 32 it is not (but I think that's a good thing). <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow.. talk about a mess.  I recently had the ...joy or something like that... to fly in, cart a number of friends around, and fly out of this airport.. \n\nWhen I landed the first thing I noticed was the fact that the airport looked like it hadn't been updated since about 1992.. I was waiting for someone to pull out a huge cell phone to make a call.. it was also about 85 degrees inside.. hello AC? \n\nMy next encounter with this lovely place was picking up my friends, as long as you fly United or Continental I've got no complaints, because they are located in Terminal 2 (where the hell is terminal 1?  it goes 2, 3, 4) but if you happen to fly into one of the other 2 getting to and from them is a mess.  \n\nOne day I had to drop a person off at 3, then go back to 2, and finally end at 4.  I think I looped the airport 18 times to try and find the correct route to do this.. \n\nThe only positives I've got about this place are the free Wi-Fi, a billion food options, and the ease of security. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this complex! The staff is excellent; they are friendly and responsive to my issues but not overly fake, invasive, or trying to create that false sense of community that never exists in a complex of hundreds of different people. The grounds are very maintained and they respond very quickly and appropriately to maintenance calls. \n\nThe only reason I gave them 4 in stead of 5 stars is because of a minor problem that exists. The walls between units are thin. Even with quiet neighbors I can hear loud conversations, movement, music, pipes running water. I don't mind the noise so much, the neighbors are fairly quiet around my unit, but if I had louder neighbors it might make for a terrible experience. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The first time I went to Rito's, my coworker and I happily drove off, chatting about how we couldn't wait to get back to the office to finally see what all the fuss is about.  Well we truly could NOT wait. We had to pull in at the parking lot of a church, not one block away from there because the aroma was just too much! Honest!\n\nRito's wouldn't be as fun without the Soup-Nazi attitude of the people running the joint.  I think it's hilarious. It's a Phoenix landmark and a MUST for out-of-towners.\n\nAnd they CAN be that way to us. They can require cash only. Make you keep your mouth shut unless ordering EXACTLY what is on the VERY LIMITED menu and nothing more.  As far as ordering goes, I ought to add that the word \""ordering\"" is misleading. We don't \""order\"" our lunch at Rito's. We request.\n\nThese people are serious and so am I. I want my bean/cheese/enchilada style and I will do whatever it takes to get it. Don't come with me and get an attitude with them or I'll rip your head off. I will NOT be 86ed from Ritos on account of you! But you can cry on my shoulder as I wolf down my burrito. I understand.\n\nOnly thing I want to correct, which I think is unfair in some other reviews: the neighborhood isn't as bad as people like to say. Yeah there is gang activity, but come on. When was the last time some innocent person just getting their lunch was assaulted or shot in the Garfield neighborhood?  Can't remember? That's because the trouble makers usually make trouble for themselves and each other and don't usually bother the rest of us. \n\nBottom line, if you can't handle central phoenix, stick with your local tacobell/pizzahut/kentuckyfriedchicken drive thru in anthem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I will never deal with these people again. In a town like Madison, where are so many decent bike shops, why would I?\n\nI went because I got a flat.\n\nTrip #1. My boyfriend drops off my bike on a Monday. They say they can't have it ready until the NEXT Thursday (11 days). The also say they're going to lube the brake lines. \n\nTrip #2. My boyfriend comes by to pick up the bike, as stated, a week and a half later. They haven't even touched it yet. They say, \""Did we call you? We'll call you.\"" They had never told him to wait until they called. He says that they seem to have totally forgotten about the bike. \n\nA few hours later, they call.\n\nTrip #3. He gets the bike. My flat is fixed. $43 dollars.\n\nI get on the bike to ride it to work. The front brake is rubbing. There were no problems with the brakes when we gave the bike to them.\n\nTrip #4. I have to go back to have them adjust the brakes. The guy running the show takes about 20 seconds. Hands it back to me. \""There you go.\"" He says. By the time I get home, the brake is rubbing again, now worse than before. \n\nI call and say, \""Can you tell me how to adjust this? I cannot come to the bike store for a 5th time.\"" He says, \""Well, there must be something seriously wrong with your brakes if we adjusted them and they're still rubbing.\"" There was nothing wrong with my brakes before I handed the bike over to them. At this point, I am so angry I can barely see straight. \n\nTrip #5. I take the bike in. They take it aside, work on it for 2 minutes, and viola! the brakes work. There's nothing wrong with them. They were just incorrectly adjusted twice. \n\nI'm sorry to have to give a bad review to my local bike shop, but our experience was that they were disorganized and took three times to get something right. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown, and Soho Bistro continues to prove me right.\n\nI have been here two or three times now, and I tend to order the more \""authentic,\"" or less popular items such as the beef noodle soup, Japanese ramen, and they have both let me down.\n\nAlso, whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I decided to try Panda Express at the mall this time over the other fast food Chinese places.  What struck me was they slice the chicken breast in front of you so you know you are not getting chopped up pieces of whatever which has always disturbed me about the other places.  They also cooked the vegetables up fresh for you.  The flavor was really good for the price and I thought the portion was just right.  I was able to have a fulfilling meal and take some home for later.  I liked the Teriyaki sauce on the side too so you can regulate how much you want on your food. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Totally underrated by the Yelpers!\n\nI freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also, I feel guilty at not letting people in on this gem.\n\nTo be clear, I LOVE Redfin Blues for a very SPECIFIC purpose: sitting outside on the patio by the water on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of Red Stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with B, Ems, Boyfriend, and whoever else is so lucky.  It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.\n\nDisclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.\n\nI basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.  \n\nOk, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.  Some of my favorite Pittsburgh moments happened here and that's saying a LOT.  Redfin Blues makes me miss you Pittsburgh! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had a hitch installed on my Subaru. Paid in advance and made an appointment time for 7am weeks in advance, and confirmed by employees.\n\nWas specifically told it would take no longer than an hour, but having an got and a half availability would be safe just in case. Three hours later I still don't have my vehicle back and it didn't look like that'll happen anytime soon. No recognition from staff that this is an issue. I was told \""ten more minutes\"" 45 minutes ago and they are still soldering wires.....\n\nThis is a 45 minute job to do! Not a good sign that they know what they're doing, and they certainly don't care about service expectations.\n\nPoor job, UHAUL. Don't use this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRETTY MUCH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE \nI am so tired overpaying and dealing with this company.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My intention was to get back to Sweet Tea's today, but they are closed on Sundays. So, being in that area, my Mother wanted the Chinese Chicken Salad at Applebee's, one of her all time favorites. Not being a true fan of chains, I agreed. And, I was very impressed. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and fresh! I also really enjoyed their seasoned fries. My Mom enjoyed her salad as well, and the staff was attentive throughout the entire meal. Shocked, yes, but happy I said yes. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers. They also have a nice sized Bar which can handle a good sized crowd. We all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue. I really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Okay, from a distance this looks like a nice hotel. But Its definitely not worth the money. The pool is made from the same material as a shower in a mobile home. Its long(ish) and not wide, with its deepest point at 4 ft. The other half of the pool is 3 feet, so you can't swim laps unless you want to hit the bottom. The fitness center lacks a fan, so working out gets too hot. The room itself has a nice view but seriously all it is is a bed and a shower. There's nothing all that nice about this $300/night room. There is nothing included: no breakfast, no drinks, a water bottle in the room costs $4, internet for ONE device is $12/day. With that price, Id expect much much more. I feel like I should only be spending maybe $100. The only reason why they get away with this price is because its conveniently located next to the convention center. Otherwise, I will never stay at this place. They nickel and dime you everywhere you turn! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A real gem!  I don't get to Madison often but I am sure that if the next trip is near a meal time I know where I'll stop, Smoky Jon's. Recently our party of three each had a different entree, one that the host suggested after learning we were newby's. He guaranteed that we would love our choices and we all did.\n\nThe BBQ pork sandwich was generous, the pork was extremely tender, cooked just right (not dried out or raw) had a smokey tang that makes it so special. The ribs were cooked to perfection and tender meat nearly fell off each bone.Their sauce is mild and OK but I was surprised by the limited choices in that area.\n\nThey offer several sides and the ones we sampled were all above par. The place is adorned with \""Best Of\"" plaques and I can see why. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This location does not have good service. Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides. While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone. Any other KFC would be better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I could say \""This is a tip top spot!\"" but that would be CHEESY and my New Year's resolution 23 years ago was to avoid such things.\n\nANYways. I definitely liked the ambiance of this space a lot. A charming neighborhood bar with horizontal narrow wood paneling, lower lighting, tiled floor, tin ceiling, and a very pretty border/trim around the ceiling. Being a small-ish space with lower ceilings and hard floors, it does get a bit noisy when the place fills up so best to beat the rush if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Also, it's another CASH ONLY spot so be sure to stock up or else they have an ATM on site.\n\nMy co-workers and I headed here for drinks one Friday. The place seemed to have a \""must order food\"" policy in order to be seated at the tables so 15 of us frustratingly spent a bit of time crowded at the entrance, downing beers, trying to decide if we should move on. Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables.  Whew!  The place was definitely running a wait by 6:30pm so, again, head out early/late!\n\nThe Mister and I headed here at 6pm on a Saturday and were able to snag the last open table in the place. The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4).  The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options. Mr. had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8.95), also tasty. We started with the cheese curds ($5.95) which were yummy. I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite... \n\nAll in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores.  I hope they are able to work out the kinks along the way (i.e., must order food to get a seat policy) but overall think this is a very nice addition to the neighborhood. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place screams style over substance.  In a sentence - trendy sexy Biltmore crowd fawns over overrated sushi.\n\nI really don't get why Zen 32 is always so crowded and busy.  Could it be that people here don't know good sushi?  I find that I keep trying to give this place a chance and will go back simply because it's one of the only bonafide sushi bars in the area - and perhaps everyone else is doing the same as well.  But mediocrity, my friend, will eventually ruin this place.  Service and long waits are to be expected here.  \n\nI even think I got sick on the happy hour sushi here a while back.  I'm blaming it on the vodka tonic and not the warmed over salmon roll, but eater beware.  The bar can get crowded too, but they have some fun watercolor boards at the bar to play around with.  Back in the restaurant, the sushi is kind of lackluster.  The sashimi and rolls I've had here were so-so.  I just haven't found this place to measure up. <|endoftext|>

We have been there several times & live only a few miles away. With that said - the Port tasting was a DISASTER! GO NOT GO THERE FOR TASTINGS!! Unlike most tastings they mark up the bottles by 100% in order to make $$ & sell their very mediocre food.  The pours were so uneven they ran out of Port for several people!! We had all paid $20 & the pours were uneven - BS!!!!!  I was livid & then they served us a tomato/basil/.crap flatbread \""complimentary\"" - WTH?? with Port?? Obviously these people know NOTHING about wine pairings.  My husband & I were very disappointed in the service, food, price point of bottles (laughable really) & the overall experience!  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Glendale Ave location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no chese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian on thin crust.  \n\nWe recently took my in-laws here and it was a hit with all! My nephew loved the cheese steak calzone. My mother and father in-law got a thick crust pizza, which was huge and hearty!  They may still be eating it for leftovers. Bro in-law and niece split a plain cheese pizza and said it was aewsome.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We happened to stumble upon this place walking downtown and figured since it's surrounded by businesses that it would be a quick lunch.  Boy were we wrong.  The staff seated us quickly and took our order but then we waited...and waited...\n\nFinally the food came out and it was mediocre at best.  The Cajun Chicken sandwich was a chicken breast with something that may have resembled paprika on it.  It tasted like cardboard and the roll it was on was hard.  It was served dry with tomato and lettuce if you wanted it.  The curly fries were surprisingly good considering the sandwich.  It took quite some time to pay our bill and the serve staff kept walking around talking about how they were short staffed and their last table didn't leave enough of a tip.  I understand that's frustrating but in front of other patrons seems a little...offf. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Ancient Chinese secret my ass.  I know the secret here and it's my formula for success all through college.  You take some meat, add veggies, and make an oyster sauce rue and viola, instant \""authentic\"" Chinese food.  We ordered several random dishes here and it was all the same.  I was pining for some Panda after this...ugh.  Only if this was being cooked by midgets on donkeys in an outdoor kitchen then yes, instant classic. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Every time the convo about restaurants in Champaign starts, the mom-in-law mentions Radio Maria. Her praise hits often and reaches far. Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.\n\nThe food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.\n\nWe started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.\n\nBeau ordered the adobo pork. Generous hunk of pig, the orange-bourbon BBQ sauce starts sweet on the tongue, then finishes with a kick...flavor was decent, but I wasn't expecting or enjoying this sweet sweet meat (SHOCK, I know!). Jalapeno-cheddar cornbread was interesting in concept, but lacking in execution...I would've never known there was jalapeno unless the menu told me! Like the roughage on my plate, the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be.\n\nCall me crazy, but I AM willing to try their brunch and/or tapas, but lemme check-in with not-my-bio-mama first... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> You need a good Chinese delivery wherever you go. This has become ours, in Madison. \n\nWe tried 3 or 4 others - including Rubys - and none of them could pass our litmus: it must be able to produce a decent General Tso's Chicken that isn't too sweet or gooey with a modicum of heat, the egg rolls must be fried in clean oil and we should never see canned vegetables. \n\nSo far, they have satisfied. The General Tso's is by far better than anything we have come across in Madison - and no, the chicken has not been spoiled for us. The battered coating before fry is not too heavy and the sauce has a little bit of heat. Personally I would like more chilis, but I realize that is an acquired taste. \n\nMu Shui style pork with plum sauce and pancakes has been fine, not dry and overcooked, and no sight of canned vegetables. Cold sesame noodles were the lightly dressed vinegar kind, not the peanut butter sauce kind. But they were fresh, not gloopy. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu but so far, it's been good. This has made us very happy, since we have always enjoyed Asian cuisines wherever we have lived (San Francisco, New York) and Madison seemed to have been devoid of decent Cantonese/Hunan/Szechuan style Chinese food. \n\nSure, it isn't Wu Leng Yi but it is quite adequate for those long work days when you get home and just don't want to cook. Delivery is always within 20 minutes even though they say 40. <|endoftext|>

Ever. \n\n I've had multiple problems with the crew in this store since they re-opened, but yesterday evening took the cake.  I went in to pick up some last minute food for the family and was immediately suspicious when I saw half a dozen people milling about unhappily at the food pickup location, an no one giving them food.  When I questioned the cashier about the delay, another customer actually came back and demanded a refund because she couldn't wait any longer.  When I noticed that half of the crew seemed to be sitting in the dining room watching TV. \n  \n I've been to this store frequently and there is definitely a pattern or very very poor and incompetent service. Almost every order I've placed had something forgotten or incorrect. There are always crewmembers milling around doing nothing, playing with the TV or in case, rapping behind the counter.\n\n I've just had it with this store, I plan on avoiding it until the get some people actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same.  At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen.\n\nUPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed.  In the last month, I have been there 2 or 3 times with simple take-out orders and everything seemed to go fine. Got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time and everyone on the crew were if not working, not blatantly goofing off. So added a Star to the rating, even though I'm still kind of leary. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Try the Dulche De Leche Milkshake. Yummm....\n\nWhen we have lunch at the food court in Scottsdale Fashion Square, I do not get a drink with the lunch, instead I get the gazzilion calorie full Dulche Shake. Yummm...Yumm....\n\nI could go on and on...lolz. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's closed!  Thank goodness!\n\nI was hear once with some girl friends and a couple of guys started chatting us up.  During the conversation one of them started to look really ill, they were both obviously drunk, and before we knew it the ill-looking one was vomiting in the corner of our table.  It was disgusting.  \nWe immediately notified the bartender who then mopped up the vomit with a dirty looking rag and declared the table good as new for incoming patrons.  Needless to say, we warned the next people who attempted to sit there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went in for the Thanksgiving Day meal that they offer.  They indicate the two options are for 3 or 6 people.  We had 4 so chose the the meal that feeds 6 to take back leftovers.  Unfortunately they provided for for 4 people, even only brought out 4 pieces of pie for desert.  After getting about one spoon of dressing we asked for extra and were charged for it!  We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering the food that did not arrive until we were half way done eating.  Service wasn't that great either, had to ask for things twice before getting the.\n\nNeedless to say, after ordering and paying for a dinner that is supposed to feed 6, we brought nothing home.  It was my parents, uncle and myself, not exactly a group that should go through a Thanksgiving meal that is supposed to feed 6.\n\nThis place may be worth the money for the regular menu (never been there for that though) but felt cheated on this TG meal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere.  Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request.  Her attitude was unacceptable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have not been here for couple of years as I moved away and i used to love going here at least once a week, since it was the closest place to the original Chicago Beef.  I have to start looking for a new place. Sorry guys.  You had the BEST what happened?? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \n\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here a handful of time, and have yet to be disappointed. You start with chips and salsa which are nothing more than average. I ordered the Don Jose Special it comes with a tamale, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and a bean tostada, with a choice of rice or beans. Everything was amazing, my personal favorite was the tacos! It's a small restaurant but don't let the size intimidate you, the food is delicious. Best part is their only 2 minutes away from me :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok, a little mushy but flavorful.  I wish I could remember the other thing, but it was better.  \n\nThe kicker was when I ordered a glass of Laphroaig.  When the bill comes, it is 75 dollars.  Apparently the only Laphroaig they have is 30 years old and no longer being produced.  And is 50 dollars a glass.  Drinking Scotch in Pittsburgh has been fun so far. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food here is okay.  Wings, BBQ, Bar foods. The floor here is always super slippery.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or sneakers.  I just don't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A lot of people (girls) I know love this place, but to me it seems like much of the same in Uptown Charlotte: it's crowded, loud, and a little over-the-top. Again, though, as I've always said: this isn't always a bad thing. \n\nOn Thursdays through Sundays, this place is pretty packed with twenty-somethings and maybe braver older adults looking to booze and get after it, probably before hitting a louder/dancier place nearby. There are plenty of food options (try their mini pizzas and other appetizers), so you can come here and grab a snick whilst you drink or before you head out to drink more. \n\nI've been told that their martinis (their selection and creativity is extensive) are awesome, so if you're into that you may wanna try them. And they usually have some great deals on those, so be sure to check that out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My vehicle was damaged during the detail....the manager Keith promised to fix the damage-- a lie...the detail was $350   damage $490--  do not risk having my experience at this company.    Dishonest  for responsibility and overpriced for the quality of detail! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  At 2am on a weekend night, the clientele is colorful, the service friendly and the food...well just forget about the food.  The food ranges from mediocre to bland.  Just be grateful there is a colorful place to go for a late night meal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station....\n\nbadump bump.\n\n\nOMG!! wtf have i been missing here. i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco...\n\ntaco was awesome. the corn tortilla was soft, supple and tasted awesome. piled high with lettuce some sliced radish and i squeezed some lemon ontop. i murdered this taco. execution style. imagine finding a duffle bag full of heads in Juarez...well this taco belonged to one of those heads..understand?\n\nthe burro was very tasty. the meat seasoned well and only two bites did i find some grisly bits. the carne asada was rolled up with some diced tomatoes and a cup of pico on the side. \n\ni kinda prefer my CA Burrito with a heap of Guacamole like how FilliB's makes them. but this was really tasty and i will order it again...after i check out the other items on the menu of course. \n\nyou will now find me here every saturday morning. \nthe tacos at Tacos De Juarez will soon refer to me as the Chalupacabre. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  went here a second time with my regular date \""D\"" on a Friday night. \nHe likes that place for some reason.\n \nI needed a drink. The female bartender gave me the beer menu and I looked at it like it was a foreign object. \""D\"" said \""oh no she won't drink beer, she'll have some kind of mixed drink\"". So the bartender made me some sweet concoction. It tasted like weak kool-aid. I ordered 2 more different drinks, even the shot of Raspberry Stoli was weak. I asked her to make me a \""British Invasion\"" cocktail and that was faintly good but definitely WEAK. \""D\"": said even his beer wasn't good. I feel like all their drinks are super watered down.\n\n the drinks at George and Dragon are a BIG dissapointment, make a note of it. \n\nHowever we also ordered food, cause I was starving. Now THAT was good. We got the Cornish Pasty with mashed potatoes and green peas and also chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce. The cornish pasty was DELICIOUS beyond Delicious. \n\n Lots of people were in there and seemed to be enjoying themselves. I just don't see the appeal of the place. Part of my family is from England but maybe I'm just not British enough to appreciate this place.\n\nI'll probably go back for the Cornish Pasty and also cause men actually FLIRTED with me there, and that NEVER happens to me in person. I like being flirted with and whistled at. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This little taqueria reminds me of the ones back in chicago. A hole in the wall but the food definitely makes up for it. I recommend the lengua with their homemade hot sauce. I've kept for a secret long enough. I always get the tacos with a jarrito. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Thank goodness for Valley Self Storage.  I have tons of stuff crammed into lockers at their facility.  The place is cooled, so your heat sensitive things aren't completely destroyed.  I have never seen a spider or any kind of bug for that matter.  I'm sure they do regular pest control which is huge.... no one wants to open a box and find something that bites or stings has crawled in and made it home.  They are extremely nice.  If you are late, or something happens to your automatic payment (happened to me) they call and make sure you are aware.  I was very happy that they did.  It would have been upsetting if they just assumed I was flaking on my contract and sold my stuff like I have heard that other storage places have done.\n\nI've been a customer there for about 6 years.  I'm very happy with them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Slow. Wrong order and didn't ask if i wanted cream and sugar. Saw one guy walking around aimlessly looking at the register. Wont be coming back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well I have had several meals over the years at Rolands, many of which were good.  Yesterday was not one of those days.\n\nAfter being seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  I was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.\n\nThen we order and when the food arrived, the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.\n\nI wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  My mother, who had the same food as I did, is feeling the same as me.\n\nGet your act together Rolands, you are better than this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great Thai food and great ambiance for a hole in the wall joint. The food has been consistent and much better than other Thai joints in the valley. The only drawback is that they do not serve fountain drinks so you pay a lot of money for one small can of soda. Stick to lunch specials if you plan to visit this joint since dinner is more expensive and literally serves up the same food minus the soup and egg roll. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We have been ordering from them for years. I had the fiery Italian  . I love their french roll. However this time I found  a piece of plastic in my sandwich and have not been able to contact the store <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, the dinner experience was wonderful.\n\nWe both got combo meals, he the chicken curry and I the fish curry. The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a \""10\"" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted \""American 10\"" or \""Indian 10\"". After finding out that \""American 10\"" = \""Indian 5\"", I was steered toward the \""Indian 7\"" which really was perfect for me. (In previous trips, we had both thought the food a touch mild, but knowing there was an Indian heat scale fixed that problem right off).\n\nIt was a wonderful dinner, and I can't wait for our next trip! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just had lunch at Eliana's today and thanks to other Yelpers, steered my way to the combo appetizer platter [and ordered an extra papusa so my friend Jim and I could both have one] as well as the chicken and shrimp entree. Before I go any further, of note here is that this is peasant food, served in simple surroundings. Having said that, its simply delicious. Our food was served all at once and was accompanied by tortillas and refried beans. These are NOT your mother's refried beans. They have an unbelievably smooth texture and are full of amazing flavor. We dipped our tortilla's [which in this case are 1/2 inch thick masa harina-esque mixed with shortening - am guessing] in the beans and just revelled in the great mix of flavor and texture. Between that and our other fave, the papusa's, we could have died happy at that moment. The papusa's are everything everyone says they are: warm, delicious, with meat, potato and cheese. Must be El Salvadoran for 'comfort food'. Its simple, flavorful and delightful. Although I was less of a fan of the shrimp/chicken/rice entree, it was still very fine. \n\nThe servers were extremely kind and friendly and when we asked about the refried bean prep, we were basically given the 411 on how they prep the beans, what they cook them with and how they get the texture [blender]. It was a delicious and satisfying lunch. Plenty of food for $21 plus tip. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not sure if this is the right listing for AT&T residential service but their internet via the new U-verse system isn't any faster, as a matter of fact it's significantly slower, than Time Warner's DSL.  The free DVR was nice but their promise of one bill for everything was a lie and I switched out as soon as I could.  Never again AT&T!  Not even for an iPhone! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cheapest hotel I could find in the Madison area.  Checking in and out was quick, employees were nice enough, the bed was comfy, the room was clean, and they even had a continental breakfast.  The air conditioning unit was pretty loud so I turned it off at night.  I also recommend bringing your own pillow.  Still, I've stayed at worse, and at $50 a night, the price is unbeatable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in its dinning room means bugs in the kitchen. Will never ever eat the food here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  \n\nThe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.\n\nMy hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  \n\nMy girl Jacqui liked her entree. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.\n\nI recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So happy I found this place, great family owners that have been so easy to deal with. I always feel they treat me fair. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is close to my office which is convenient.  I have eaten take out from here at least 10 times and have yet to be disappointing.  I don't expect a whole lot from a Asian take out place.  Consistent food quality, clean, and most important to me for judging Chinese food is a fresh cooked egg roll.  There is no reason to precook them and let them stew in their own grease.  I have yet to have an experience to not come back here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> These guys do a great job. I've looked everywhere for a drive thru wash with soft pads so it doesn't scratch my paint..drive thrus r harsh on black..and not only does this place have it but the guys come out and give ur car a pre hand scrubbed wash down..legit..$5-7 can't beat it. Both me and my fiance come here..both black sports cars and never worry about scratches. :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Let me start off by saying that as soon as I purchased my bridesmaid dress I was no longer assisted in any way possible. It's like as soon as they got their hands on my money, I didn't exist.  I was called about 3 weeks later and was told my dress was ready to be picked up. I went in the next day and the zipper was ripped before I even touched it.  I asked if alterations would be able to come see and assist me and the sales girl rolled her eyes at me.  As soon as alterations came out I showed her that the zipper was clearly ripped and she said yeah I can fix it and walked away, I'm like hello can you stand here minute and see if I need help anywhere else with the dress, and she had already started helping somebody else.  Again I had to hunt down another salesperson for help.  They told me I would have two weeks to pick up my dress after the alterations were done.  Two days later I received a voicemail that my dress would be available to be picked up, so I called back asking if it needed to be picked up tonight or of I still had two weeks, and the person on the phone was like, \"" I don't know what's going on with your dress, so I don't know what to tell you. \"" I'm like can you please find out, is this so difficult to verify a simple question and she replied \"" if that's what they told you, then I guess that's true.\"" I am completely Unsatisfied with they service at this store.  I work in retail and would never treat a customer the way I have been treated by several of these employees.  I am usually not one to write a yelp review, but I actually signed up for an account to post one because of how horrible the service is here.  The only reason I shopped here is because my friend who lives out of state is having all her bridesmaids purchase here.  She, too, knows about the bad service and will be contacting her location as well. \n\nIf I could give no stars I would. Will be contacting manager and corporate. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I share Tim's sentiments about Behind the Mask.  In a hockey store starved town, BTM could really rake you over the coals for their inventory.  Yet I always come out of there paying $5-$10 less than the ticketed price.  I have even gone in there needing small replacement items, willing to pay $10-$15 for it, but somehow I never end up paying.  The manager, Brian, is a goalie like myself, and I could spend all day talking about random things, equipment, or the state of the game.  I don't even bother ordering from catalogs or websites and go directly to BTM. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I haven't had an appointment with any of the providers here. I didn't make it past the front office staff before I realized that, even if they deemed me worthy of their help and time, I'd not be using their services. \n\nI previously had an appointment with them a year or so ago, and decided to go with another provider, and was fairly certain I had cancelled my appointment. When I called about 5 minutes ago to make an appointment, the response I received was very cold. I was informed that I had not cancelled my appointment, and that I needed to contact my insurance company for some vague reason. It was made very clear to me that I was not welcome to book an appointment with ANY of their clinicians. EVER. \n\nI can understand giving me a hard time, or even making me pay a fee. But to also make me feel like I was a criminal and categorically refuse me service was unkind. Honestly, I'm sure they're doing fine as a business and have plenty of satisfied customers. But I will not be among them. It's clear to me that either the person who took my call is a miserable human, or that the policies of this office are such that they care more about being paid and being punitive than they do about helping people. What if I had been a suicidal caller? They have no idea what kind of problems I might have. They didn't care. Just categorically accused me of daring to \""no-show\"" to an appointment and then wanting some compassionate care. Alright. Good luck as a business. Apologies for my arrogance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past decade, and have always had a very good experience, so am baffled by the negativity. Food is SO much better than Carrabas, Olive Garden, etc., I don't know if locals don't know good Italian food when they taste it (I'm from Boston, which has many great Italian restaurants), or if it's a weekend problem (I almost never eat out on weekends, since service is always worse on busy nights at any restaurant). We went Wednesday for my birthday, and it was great; the Italian nachos appetizer was one of the tastiest dishes I have had in last few years, and the bill was less than I anticipated. My favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte, not a 5 star Chicago/NY/Boston restaurant, but it is very good for the money, and I heartily recommend it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My first meal as a Charlottean was had at this establishment.  I had a taste for fish, and so was pleased to find more than a few appealing options on the dinner menu.  I opted for the trout, preceded by the classic french onion soup.  David X. had the special, a smoked salmon pasta.\n\nThe good: the trout was delightful, well complimented by potatoes and a light tomatoey sauce.  The portions were perfect, aka not too big.  Basically this dish saved the experience for me.\n\nThe ok: the bread was warm (not hot) and the salmon special was pretty good too.  Smoked salmon plus creamy sauce, yum.\n\nThe underwhelming: the french onion soup was not hot.  The cheese was not bubbling or gooey, it was a bit congealed.  Meh.  And, to echo the words of others, the service was more than just pokey.  This was a bit absurd because we were the only people eating in the restaurant.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe, to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much. Maybe they're a bit more on top of their game for breakfast/brunch.  But probably not for dinner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went to this restaurant for my girlfriends bday. they definitely exceeded my expectation. service was excellent. they ushered us to a booth with the table decorated. then they sat us down and put roses and 2 glasses of champagne for us. took a picture of us and put it on a card. i was taken back. now onto the food. \nWagyu Carpachio - awesome. thinly sliced and generous portions\nLobster Bisque - lots of lobster in the soup. not as creamy as most would have it. ++ for me\nShrimp Cocktail - got 5 shrimps. and they were big shrimps. very fresh and juicy.\nSesame crusted Ahi Tuna. if you dont like sushi, dont try it. difficult to cook. tasted a little bland to me IMO. \nPorterhouse_ excellent cut. nothing else needed on top of the steak. cooked perfectly. \n\nNight ended with a complimentary chocolate cake. awesome cake!. \nThank you Capital Grille! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\n\nCasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\n\nService was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm shocked at myself that I ate here, but it was a last resort due to me needing to take Adam to the airport.  I've been to Chuys in Tucson for dinner, which is always have had a good experience with it being that it is a total hole in the wall.  But did anyone know that they had breakfast?!  Well they do.  So we went in and weren't expecting the world knowing what the place was.  We sat ourselves because there was no staff in sight and just 2 older people at the bar, at 8am lol.  So we sat for a few minutes and then a girl came to us.  She got our drinks and then we told her we were ready to order and she said that they don't do table service and she would meet us at the register.  My mind was boggled because there were only 2 other customers in there who were done eating.  How could she not think that she should just take our order with ALL the time she had instead of making us walk ALL the way across the restaurant to place an order for a whole 2 burritos.  So I give her zero stars!  I give the burritos 3 stars because they weren't the best I've ever had but they were good enough and they didn't give me a tummy ache!  So I give a total of 2 stars because of the servers one star.\n\nChuys is always going to be a good choice for mesquite when you need a quick bite! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite place for sandwiches and salads.  The staff here are the friendliest I have encountered since I moved to AZ (the staff must all be from somewhere else!).  The bakery items are also very good. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I first visited this zoo yesterday. My expectations were too high apparently, because honestly it was the worst zoo experience I have ever had. Maybe I am spoiled....the zoo I grew up going to \""Reid Park Zoo\"" in Tucson is 20 times better!\n\nThe animal selection was pathetic. The only thing that impressed me was the enclosures are large, which is great for the animals, but the variety is lacking. I do not recommend going during the afternoon on a hot day. The animals were all hiding and sleeping to avoid the heat.\n\nBring your own food/water!!! This place is GOUGING it's guests!! $3 for a bottle of soda!!!! The prices for the snack bars are astronomical! $6 for a HOT DOG! OUCH!\n\nI do not have plans of ever going back to this zoo, from now on I will take the 100 mile trip to Tucson, and will likely end up spending LESS (with gas included) than at the Phoenix Zoo. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\n\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \""sugar-fried\"" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\n\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\n\nOh well... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Great service and location.  Food was ok nothing great. We all ordered the Sunday Brunch. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been here a few times and each time was fun. The drinks are cheap and the bartenders are friendly.  Good neighborhood bar where you can drink cold beer and meet new people. Casual atmosphere and relaxing.  Can't say I'm a regular but I'm working on it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hmmm...Phoenix Airport.\n\nLet's see what we have. The one thing a hub should not do is make it difficult to get from Flight A to Flight B. A mandatory walk across the airport is not good. I bought spinners so I could get around airports on transfers. That carpet will not let you roll yours easily. The bathrooms are minimal in size. Screens you have to squint at to view arrivals and departures are another underwhelming feature there.\n\n Oh well. Getting liquored up here at the many bars/restaurants is Ground Harbor's one redeeming feature. They do have some decent southwestern faire though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family and I came here for Sunday brunch to celebrate my father's birthday.  We were seated around noon and I was starving.  As other people have said, don't you dare eat a single thing before you come here or you will have to be rolled out like Violet Beauregarde.\n\nThey start you off with a complimentary blood mary or mimosa.  Um, hai.  I like your style.  And you pick your entree (of course, the famous pasta trio is an option).\n\nThen you get to take your fill of their antipasto spread.  A dozen different salad options, mussels, cheese, olives, frittata...  I had to try a bit of everything and yes, I was that person walking back to my table with two plates.\n\nMy entree was duck gnocchi.  I felt a little guilty because I adore duckies but damn was it tasty.  The gnocchi were like little pillows they were so light and fluffy.  Lidia, WHAT IS YOUR SECRET!?  Best gnocchi I have ever had (and I don't even really like it that much; something about it just called to me).\n\nAnd then they wrap you up with a dessert table.  I was about read to pop and we had homemade ice cream and cake at home but I couldn't stop myself.  The little cookies were crisp and perfectly satisfying to wrap up a meal.  But I didn't stop there.  You're at Lidia's, you eat the tiramisu.  Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and perfect with a cup of coffee.  That coffee was so good, I didn't even need cream and sugar.\n\nSlight downfalls: the waiter didn't know who was the birthday person (discreetly ask if you don't know, just don't plunk it down in front of someone) and the wait staff cleared away all serviceware before I was done.  I still had bread on my plate and I also needed a knife to cut through the baguette French-toast-like dessert - would have liked to enjoy it but I couldn't.\n\nAll in all, a great brunch.  Definitely the place to go for a special occasion. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> First of all, This review is only base on lunch time because I've never been there at dinner, HOWEVER this place been open for a LOOOOONG time as far as chinese restaurant goes in that area, this place is PACKED for lunch almost ALL the time in the weekdays but the service is incredibly fast and the food comes out quick too so the wait is usually minimal or none at all.  their lunch special is only around $6-$7 so very reasonable and its always delicious i've been there for probably over 30 times for lunch and i've never had a dish i dont like,  their meat, their sauces is very flavorful! if ur in the area and have a thing for some good ole chinese food for lunch, give this place a shot! u wont be disapointed! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> No trip to Phoenix is complete without at least one visit to LGO.  The Spanish Latte is now the Havana Latte, but I'm protesting and still ordering the Spanish...just to show them that I've been around since the beginning.  I'm an ol' time LGO'er.  \n\nThe menu has been expanded a little and I'm ok with that.  Service seems to have picked up a little in the speed department, which is good.  \n\nI'll probably be back one more time before I head to the airport back to Chicago. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Friday night, pretty busy, bar somewhat busy and the bartender (attractive, female, brunet) answers the house phone and has been talking for 15 minutes as I write this..  ????  WTF..  never coming back.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Having now been to a handful of shows here (most recently the touring version of Young Frankenstein), I am impressed with both the facility and the execution of service from all the house staff.  It makes an evening of arts and culture just that much nicer to enjoy.\n\nThe facility, adjacent and accessible from Founders Hall, is (relatively) new and sparkling throughout.  The lobby spaces are very open and offer a number of modern chairs and benches to provide seating to patrons.  A wide spiral staircase connects you to your level of seats and each level has a concession bar offering beer, wine, spirits, water, and a few snacks.  Prices are a little steep, but not so bad as at your typical movieplex.  Bonus tip: you can pre-order and pay for a drink during intermission.  When you walk out, there is a side table with your drink and order slip waiting for you.  So convenient and easy, as your time waiting in line is all but eliminated.\n\nI also think the seating inside the theater is very good, from most all levels.  If anything, the Orchestra seats may be close to the stage but require angling your neck up to see the action.  The seats in both the grand tier and mezzanine levels allow you to look down on the action but do offer unobstructed views.\n\nThe staff, located in the mint green jackets, are literally everywhere and available to help you find the most convenient door and path to your seats.  If you ever have a problem with patrons around you, a discreet word to an usher will quickly remedy the issue.  Bonus tip 2: they also sell parking passes for $5 before, during, and after the show.  There are 4 decks near the BPAC that accept the coupons.  The staff will check your parking ticket to make sure you parked in a qualifying deck and will then sell you a $5 ticket to get out after the show is over.  I can't say how helpful this is- you just feed the coupon into the gate and off you go- no digging for cash or waiting for a credit card receipt to slow you down.  \n\nBravo to this facility and their staff- they make a nice evening out just that much more enjoyable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't really have to much to say about Sophie's.  The food wasn't bad, the service wasn't horrible... it's just that my overall experience wasn't what I'd have expected from a restaurant that touts such an amazing reputation for fine French cuisine.  It's not often I leave a place so hungry for the experience I didn't get to have.  . Again, the food was not bad, but I'm not sure If I will ever be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I lived at the Heritage for close to three years so I have a pretty good understanding of this property. First, the apartments are not well insulated AT ALL!! ALL my windows leaked air - the blinds were hanging on by a thread & would fall off the window on top of me on a regular basis. You put in a maintenance request & they come & rig them only to fall off again a week later! Management is horrible. They all have nice fake smiles but when it really comes down to it they could care less about their tenants!! Break-ins are becoming a regular occurrence there too so if safety is a concern, I wouldn't chose these apartments. Also they are very overpriced & will raise your rent EVERY time you sign for another year by at least $50 a month.\nTo top it all off I just moved out & gave them my forwarding address & they sent my deposit to the apartment at their community that I have just moved out of. Talk about incompetent!!\n\nOh ya -- also the landscaping people come at least 1x a week & they keep up the grounds -- but you can't leave your windows open as they wear motorized backpacks that are extremely loud & leave your apartment filled w the smell of gas!!\n\nRead more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/AZ-Phoenix-The-Heritage-867679.html#ixzz0X3kkAfRC <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love love love this store. It's a mecca of kooky gifts, books, cards, calendars, tshirts, jewelry, candles... pretty much everything you could ask for. I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches. You'll be hard pressed to NOT buy anything before you leave. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We had planned on eating a late breakfast at the Original Breakfast House just down 32nd Street, but did not realize that they would be closed for Labor Day. We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.\n\nThe entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.\n\nWell, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.      \n\nThis Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.  When you are serving \""average\"" food, however, it's critical that employees and managers go above and beyond to compensate. That did not happen on this day.  Not even close. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Took my daughters bike in for inner tubes after 5:30 on a Friday. The guy was nice and said he could change them right then if we wanted. Honestly, I was too tired to wait, but her bike was ready the very next day. \nWhen we picked up the bike, a different guy helped us and we were in and out. No wait time. The staff seem very nice and helpful. The price wasn't too bad. When I originally called about pricing, Mike provided me with 3 different pricing options which was nice bc I wasn't able to spend too much. My experience was great and I would definitely use them again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Three friends & I [all in our twenties] stayed in a hotel room here overnight. The decor is beautiful, and the service was quick and easy. The concierge gave us free covers into the local bars at the epicentre so be sure to ask. The room was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and it was a great price to stay downtown. It was a great hotel experience! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> SkyHarbor seems to be cleaning up its act. The TSA lines are shorter and more are open than I remember from the past. I like the free wifi and the restaurant and shop choices are good. \n\nThis is still a super busy airport, especially on SouthWest. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm done with this location. The drinks are the usual you'd get from any other Starbucks. However, beware if you aren't a regular. I stop by this location every few weeks if it's convenient to get a hot vanilla latte--nothing fancy. But they always manage to get the complicated, fancy drinks with a cup of sugar done well before mine, even when I'd been 2 people in line before them. Are these folks regulars? Maybe, but that's no reason to provide bad customer service to everyone else. Twice they'd completely forgotten my order.\n\nThese folks are also quick to call the cops on homeless people walking by or sitting outside reading the newspaper. Most other locations in central Phoenix don't seem to have a problem when homeless people sit near or in the cafes; in fact, I've seen baristas at other locations offer water, etc. So, if you're not into a place that criminalizes someone who hasn't done anything wrong, I wouldn't recommend patronizing this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> New kitchen manager is making some great food these days! AWESOME fish fry on Friday night. Soup is outstanding and service is friendly and fast, and fun! There's also a new appetizer on the menu that is quite tasty  - spring rolls with a raspberry sauce and a cucumber/garlic pepper sauce - just outstanding! Service is friendly, too! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disappointed doesn't begin to explain. I now spent $350 on a bridesmaid dress that will never be worn. It is the wrong size, they won't alter it. They will do nothing and now I do not have a dress to wear at a wedding that is 2 1/2 weeks away. \nHailey the assistant manager is clueless and unhelpful. She knew nothing about the dress which is why it is wrong. So I thought maybe the manager Hannah would help. NOPE. Nothing. They even made the bride call the manufacturer herself, talk about poor customer service.\nI would NEVER recommend Nitsa's. I would even give it one star. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian \""signature\"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates at buffet. All yours for $28 per person! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Don't go! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the food a 3, service 3 and ambiance 5. Prices are high and serving size small. \n\nThe tandoori chicken is the worst I have eaten in AZ. For a moment there I was envying my dog's chew stick. Really, it sucked.\n\nWonder how they survive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isn't alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So 4 stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isn't any other place in the valley like it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Last night was my first time here and it was delicious!! I can't believe I didn't try this sooner. It was for a work party and boy am I glad we decided to come here! The pizza was so flavorful and simply delicious! \n\nMy only concern was the service, over all it was great but the waitress did forget my water... I asked twice, and it wasn't until our dessert that I finally got the water.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.\n\nSalads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).\n\nThe pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead, just get a plate of those garlic knots. They're the best thing there.\n\nAnd the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean, what kind of place is dead empty of all wait staff, bartenders, or any person who worked there for that long during the lunch rush? Seems odd. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is blah. I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!\n\nThey raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.\n\nAlso, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.\n\nThe food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.\n\nAlso, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.\n\nYah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Sure we only go with a DealChicken.com coupon but it's always great! Sit in the bar area as the dining room is very dated due to the mansions age. The bar area is much more, how would you say? relaxed and romantic. GREAT views from in there also! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Okay, so because I'm so excited to have eaten here, and I want to use obscenities to describe the deliciousness, I have decided to replace any PG-13 words with PG words. And....\n\nThis place was flippin' good! I mean, gosh darn! How the heck did they just do that? Each bite made whoopee to my taste buds and stayed around afterwards to cuddle! It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!\n\nOkay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.\n\nEvery person reading this needs to do themselves a favor and endure the trip to Central Phoenix for this place. If you love Mexican food (especially chilaquiles), La Tolteca should not disappoint in the slightest. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Keegan's is in my neighborhood and I have driven past it many many times and surprisingly have never eaten here.  Went in today for breakfast around 10:30 and it was not the best experience, the food was OK  but I highly doubt I will go back.  First off the hostess seemed to be sick, she had the sniffles and literally said \""sorry, I'm still asleep,\"" as she sat us down. Then she set our table and touched every single part of our utensils with her unwashed hands.  After she had been yawning, sniffling and touching the door and menus.  I'm not a big germa-phone but this is not very appealing as I'm about to eat.  Then our waitress came along and was not familiar with the menu at all.   She was still friendly and attentive, but overall not the greatest experience.   Next time I think we'll try Noca next door. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  She was great at explaining the process and seemed to really know what she was doing. The office is nice and very clean. However she didn't show up for our second appointment, or answer the phone, or even call me back. Come to think of it I don't think she ever even asked my name. I waited outside in freezing January for 15 minutes because you can't even enter the building unless she lets you in. Needless to say I was none too happy and gave up. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Big comfy couches + soft lounge music= a great time! The ambience was chill and the drinks were strong. They accommodated our large group nicely without feeling overcrowded. Definitely pay a visit if you're looking for something more cool and low-key from the typical loud, raucous bar scene. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came last Saturday on a whim. I had been passing this place on my walks around the area. Seeing all those people buzzing in there enticed me. It didn't take long to be seated, considering how many people were in there. I ordered fried chicken ( breast and wing), macaroni and cheese, and red beans with a lemonade. Mistakenly, they brought wings and I immediately alerted the waitress. Then, I received my order. Everything except for the red beans was scrumptious. For dessert, I selected German chocolate cake. It was not extravagantly delicious but nice. Next time, I'll get for my sides macaroni and cheese with potato salad, then finish with yellow cake and chocolate icing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went here once with a friend.\n\nWe had the lunch buffet which was average. \n\nUntil, I saw two cockroaches crawling around.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This rating is based on my most recent visit because it had been quite a long time since I had been here.\n\nNuts and bolts: Went with the family to celebrate a birthday.\n\nOrder: 1 app, 3 orders of soup, salad, and breadsticks, 1 rosemary chicken, and 1 lasagna.\n\nPros: Everybody left content and very full. Our waiter kept the breadsticks and salad coming. Multiple orders of soup were taken. Love the extra cheese on top of anything you want. Great price- got all that food for around $60 plus tip. Our waiter was very attentive and made us laugh a few times. Even wished my dad a happy birthday because he overheard us mentioning it being his birthday lunch.\n\nNeutral: Rosemary chicken was OK. Chicken gnocchi soup could have been a bit spicier. Minestrone was OK.\n\nTake home: Kinda wish I had tipped my server more (I did a bit over 20%). He was wonderful. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great venue for music, not a bad seat in the house. We sat 90 degreas to the stage and it sounded great. This has become my go to Phoenix Blues! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place and loved their panang beef curry. I haven't had such a flavorful panang curry in a long time!  Might go back again this week while I am still in town! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> One of our family's favorite choices for pizza...staff has always been very friendly and helpful at this location even when we have to customize their specialty pizzas for the kids. Over the summer we have also tried their s'mores pizza and it was a big hit.  Our favorite right now is the  Herb Chicken Mediterranean....would definitely recommend giving it a try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been around the proverbial gay bar block, so to speak, so my expectations are pretty high. However, tonight proved to be a good time here. It's a very relaxed atmosphere with excellent drink specials and fun, friendly people to small talk with.\n\nCalm, supportive, flirty and fun..Plazma is a good bar to be yourself. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Okay, how can you not like Texaz Grill? Bad mood? Not hungry? Vegan? Bringing a baby carrier? Then you should probably stay home. Yes, it's a dive in an aging strip mall at 16th and Bethany. Yes, there is lots of junk hanging from the ceiling and walls that a few won't appreciate as low-brow Texas ambiance. And yes, the portions tend to be on the \""enormous\"" side so if you're watching your waistline, plan on splitting a meal. \n\nBut rest assured the place is a Phoenix icon and will be 'til way after you're gone. It is texas-style comfort food - nice and simple. The steaks are great - they cut and age their own like a real steakhouse. The prime rib, when you arrive early enough, is superb - and shockingly cheap considering the cut. And I doubt you'd find a better, more authentic texas-style chicken fried steak (and chicken fried chicken) anywhere in town. So big you'll want to share - or take 1/2 home. But is is goooood.\n\nIf you're a newbie to Texas Grill - it's good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years. This tip is helpful so that you don't get lynched by the surrounding tables for dissing the busy waitress because your water glass gets low. Come to Texaz in a good mood and ready to eat and you'll be fine. In time the staff may take a cotton to you too - but you'll have to earn it.\n\nThere's not a mistake on the menu. One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger (it's not on the menu) and you'll have one of the best burgers in town. If you're a party of one or there's a few open seats - belly up to the bar. Tammy and Cindy are the usual evening bartenders and they serve one of the best margaritas in town - on the rocks (only) and with salt of course. The selection at the bar is simple and basic, but you'll be entertained all night trying to read decades of bumper stickers and fridge magnets. You may even meet a few new friends as the regulars are a friendly bunch (especially after a marg or two).\n\nWhen visitors come to town, you can bet Texaz is always in the mix. Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam, downtown for urban cool, and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food, you can't beat Texaz.  Watch for us at the bar! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am not impressed.  The food was so-so and my boyfriend and I had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. I bought it that morning, sorry if it should have been taken off the website but you should honor it. I would not pay their full price for it, but with a nice coupon then maybe it could be worth it. The quality of the food was not good enough to outweigh the service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.\n\nThe second time, though, was tonight, Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it, then. It wasn't very crowded, so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.\n\nOh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I agree with other reviewers that this is a great value. I stayed here for 6 days during a recent work trip and because I have stayed at other Homewoods in the past. \n\nEach room us a suite equipped with a small kitchen, living room and bedroom. The beds are very comfortable with plenty of pillows. There is also a TV in each room. There is a workout room with a couple of ellipticals and treadmills with TVs on each. I love that. Breakfast is free and also they have a featured dinner with free beer and wine. I don't typically eat the dinner but like to bring a glass of wine back to the room. \n\nI believe they also do a free shuttle to the airport but I had a rental car. The only thing I found annoying was that there were only like 8 hangers. Being there for a week, it would have been nice to have more to hang my pressed work clothes on. Other than that, this place is a wonderful place to stay. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I would imagine things would be different if I stayed here when they did not have a convention in town but I did!\n\nChecked in to a room on the 6th floor (out of 10).  I had pounding and banging all round me due to remodeling.  They did finish by late afternoon but the hallways were full of beds and other room furniture.  Besides being unsightly, that wasn't a big deal.  My problems started at night  and the next morning.   \n\nWhen the meeting in one of the ballrooms ended apparently most of the people didn't have enough!  Because of the set up of he hotel every room in the hotel faces the bar.  Even though the bar is on the ground floor the noise funnels up and it becomes a big echo chamber!  Noise continued until about 1am.  I'm not sure if I was pissed because I couldn't sleep or if I was just jealous that I sounded like they were having a lot of fun!\n\nThe next morning was a JOKE!  Trying to leave wad impossible.  Why they would build a hotel with 10 floors and only 2 elevators is beyond me!  With people checking out, going to breakfast or just moving around it was Impossible to get on an elevator unless you were on the top 2 floors.  People were lined up on every floor trying to get somewhere.  The smart people started getting on using the \""up\"" button and just going for a ride.  I finally have up and lugged my bags down six floors of stairs. What I found has a huge line of others doing the same.  I felt like a refugee!!!  Some women a head of me were having troubles because they had multiple bags.  Eventually one of them fell.... I wasn't pretty.  \n\nI found that this hotel looked nice, had a nice pool.  But I would never stay here on a weekend or when it was busy ever again!  They need to find a away to build another elevator and bite the bullet and shut the bar down much earlier or move it into one of the ballrooms. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Place is ok but a little uncomfortable. There's water damage in some corners of the the ceiling and it looks pretty creepy. There are stains on the walls and ironing board but, overall, it's ok. The bathroom was freshly stocked, toilet and shower was clean and functional, bed seemed to be bedbug-free and is comfortable enough to lay your head at night, TV worked just fine as well. The continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster. The place is pretty much centrally located & it does have great potential..overall, it was an ok stay and I may stay again after they've completed the renovations. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Furniture is great and have used Pruitt's for over 10 years. We have purchased carpet twice from them and the first time we had shipping and production issues and had to be on cement floors for a month and finally I had to suggest us changing to a different color as it took that long for them to let me know what the issue was. We purchased carpet almost two years ago from them again on another home and I have had them out 3 times to re-stretch it, the manufacturer came out and said he was going to replace some of it as it seems it was a bad roll but that has never happened and no one ever follows-up I have to call every month to get an update. Now we are waiting on an independent inspector who was suppose to call us three weeks ago and still no word from them or Pruitts. Buy the furniture but not the carpet... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  NOTE: The \""Poor\"" review/rating is only for John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice facility and staff and NOT for Dr. Mora whom our entire family loves. \n\nDr. Mora is our family doctor. Dr. Mora is incredibly knowledgeable, and getting an appointment to see him is very easy. When you meet Dr. Mora, he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs. It is important to note that Dr. Mora has moved his practice location recently. \n\nDr. Mora used to be with John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice group located at 18404 North Tatum Boulevard , Phoenix, AZ 85032, (602) 992-1900. This John C. Lincoln group was atrocious! With the exception of Dr. Mora and his Medical Assistant Erica, the rest of the staff there were terribly rude. Not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there. (Also you should know that if you call the John C. Lincoln office where Dr. Mora used to work, they will NOT tell you that Dr. Mora has moved. Instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there, and I would not recommend any other doctor there to see.) So, I couldn't be happier that Dr. Mora has moved! \n\nDr. Mora now works for Scottsdale Healthcare Primary Care Paradise Valley, 5010 E. Shea Blvd., Suite D100, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, (480) 882-7420. This new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to. It is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful. If you are new to the valley or looking to change doctors, please consider going to see Dr. Mora at his new practice location. You will not find a better doctor in the valley than Dr. Mora! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Just tried Mimosa Grill for Sunday brunch. The buffet selection included eggs, sausage, and French toast; plus lunch items like macaroni and cheese and salmon.\n\nThe service was excellent even though we were at the end of brunch- water glasses were kept full and clean silverware was brought.\n\nI enjoyed our view of Uptown.\n\nOnly quirk- when we were brought clean silverware for dessert, our napkins were placed on the back of our chair. I didn't realize this.\n\nOverall, food, service, and mimosas were excellent; I look forward to returning for dinner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This has to be my absolute favorite for special occasions and all other occasions for that matter. \nThe wait staff is prompt and professional. The food, from beginning to end is overwhelmingly delicious. I love it; the breads, salads, soups, main courses, desserts, wine, drinks. It is all so good. \nI can't wait to go back, hopefully soon.\nA couple of years ago, we saw Senator McCain with his wife and 2 other couples there at dinner. Wonder if we will see a blog from him for Vincent's on yelp.com....hmm? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yeah, I just DONT get it. The service was fine and the prices are very reasonable, but this is in no way a \""good\"" meal. It's inexpensive and the portions are mammoth, but that doesn't make a \""good\"" chicken fried steak. If you are a quantity over quality person than yes... This is probably your place... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> No frills, no fake smiling employees, just REALLY GREAT BREAD. Fresh, authentic, all natural ingredients and very good prices. I regularly buy 2 baguettes here for a $1.25 or $1.50. Lots of rolls, breadsticks, rye, wheat and focaccia. It's a small store at the bakery, prices are a lot lower than at Wholey's or somewhere else in the city. Many restaurants use breadworks. Great stuff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was at your grand opening, I was there after, and I'm not there anymore. \n\nWild Thaiger was never a great option for Thai in the valley. There aren't really any terrible aspects about the restaurant, it's just that nothing really makes you say \""wow! this is good.\""\n\nMy last visit was with a friend who doesn't get out much, his wife likes good ol' steak and potatoes, so I thought I'd take him somewhere he couldn't go otherwise. Bad choice. We ordered the peanut chicken and it tasted more like peanut butter chicken. It was overpowering, and also one of the first times I have ever sent a dish back and asked for something else. Of course the service is good, they never have anything better to do. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Went to see \""The Great American Trailer Park Musical\"".  The show was awesome - very well produced and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  My bar drink, while pricey, was ...generous, to say the least.  It lasted the entire show! :)\n\nWe will definitely be back - we had a wonderful time and felt very welcomed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The staff is knowledgeable about shoes and if you want someone who knows what they are doing to help you. They treat every customer with full attention. I have gone there to purchase tennis shoes. Salesman was friendly and provide me shoes fit my feet, nice look and with reasonable prices. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Loved our waitresses!  They were fun and personal with attitude!  Food was so so. The BBQ ribs were small beef short ribs with a thin vinegar based sauce.  The Mac n cheese was the best!  The collard greens were hard and vinegar based.  The peach cobbler was just so so.  Atmosphere ans waitresses are the best part of the restaurant. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> the deep fried catfish!!!  \n\nas others mentioned, the Friday evening buffets are really worth it.  About $10 per person.  You can try all the tasty meats and side dishes.\n\nI like that they also have a salad bar with fresh cut watermelon, at least the night we were there. \n\nAnd we got to meet David!  The guy harboring all the secret recipes of the menu in his head. \n\nThe interior is very divey and I wouldn't change a thing. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I walked into this nail salon hoping for a quick and decent manicure pedicure.  My nail technician, Cathy, was very sweet--however she rushed through everything.  She squirted cuticle remover all over my dress, slobbed it onto my hands and feet and never completely rinsed it off.  She didn't even bother with a top coat on my pedicure.\n\nHer tools were kept all jumbled together in a dirty plastic container--not once did I see her put anything into a disinfectant.  The woman next to me finished with her pedicure and they simply drained the bowl --nobody scrubbed it, or even rinsed it. \n\nI also thought they had a poor color selection at this place.  All outdated OPI shades.\n\nI wouldn't come here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.  I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost.\n\nI'm very satisfied with my experience with them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  When I think of Westins, I think of business-classy, nice and modern. This hotel has a classic feel to it, but definitely not very updated. Unfortunately, it reminds me of the staid-ness of Pittsburgh too much.\n\nThe check-in desk was super slow during my stay there. I do like the fact that there's a Fish Market downstairs. I don't like the fact that it's the convention center hotel, so it can get pretty crowded. That said, it's within walking distance to the Strip, and Downtown, so you can't deny the convenience. Still, I think there are newer hotels that provide the same. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I was not impressed.  We were here with a group of friends and the staff didn't seem to care if they waited on us or not.  When our server did come around, he was friendly and seemed to enjoy what he was doing, but honestly, I've had better service at other places <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I don't belong here, that's a given. Immediately when I walk in, I feel like there's a bright, shinning light over my head, as if I'm on stage and it's otherwise pitch black. Translation: I don't belong here. \n\nI walk the aisles, admire the plethora of things I've never been seen or heard of. I look at the frozen fish and wonder how in the world to prepare such things. I look at the sake aisle and wish I knew which to pick, which one wouldn't soil my taste buds. Sometimes I'm tempted to pick up their fresh slices of sashimi, but I usually pass. I just can't talk myself into it. \n\nI walk by the fresh fish, past the butchers and men with their imploring eyes. I feel uncomfortable under their gaze. I can only imagine what they're thinking. That's when I pretend even harder - pretend that I know what I'm doing, instead of wandering the aisles looking at anything from poxy stix to soy sauce. \n\nThen I end up in the meat section, dumbstruck. Gizzards. Tongue. Heart. It's like a lab here, animals dissected to entertain my morbid fascination. I tend to get repulsed when I get to the chicken feet. \n\nSo, I pass through the produce aisle and stutter near the bakery. Here is where I once picked up the most delicious bread I've ever had. It certainly wasn't healthy, but I don't care. I've since gone back looking for another loaf, but have yet to find it fresh on display. I keep hoping, though, that someday we will be re-united -- myself and that delectable bread - otherwise known as \""crack in a bag.\""  \n\nSo, if I'm so uncomfortable, why do I even bother? Because I like trying new things, from teas to bread to meat. I just can't seem to pick up the latter, for fear of self-poisoning. Plus, nothing beats cheap bags of edamame here. Other stores want nearly $4 for a bag. Screw that. \n\nI've also tried their milk pearl tea here. It's not bad. It's not something I'd get very often, for I can find better concoctions elsewhere. But, for what it's worth, it's not a bad choice if you're in need of quenching your thirst while you peruse the many aisles of Asian wonderments. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Very good ramen. Had some excellent pot stickers and edamame as well. Cheaply priced as well! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said, however, I was really excited by the beer selection and the neon green relish. If you're looking for a chill meal, this is a great place to check out! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was first introduced to Korean food my freshman year in college. It was a match made in kimchi heaven. This love affair has now extended to the Korean culture and language. Sam Bok is the perfect venue to get anything Korean cuisine related and has some wonderful Ahjummas (ladies) who will let you try out you newly mastered though limited skills at speaking Korean. \n\nI love making my own kimchi chigae - not proficient enough to make my own kimchi though. Sam Bok sells really good cabbage and radish kimchi that you can pick up anytime. It's available in several sizes. I also like their black bean sauce, yam noodle packets, spices and spicy ramyun packets (Asian ramen that will blow your socks off). I recently picked up a couple of bread rolls with cream filling which is a Korean delicacy that satisfies your sweet and savory cravings. Sam Bok's bread was wonderful, I will definitely go back for more of those. \n\nI suggest giving Sam Bok a shot, it's unique, local and always inviting. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I shop here often the selection can be some what lacking in the men's department. Beyond that this particular location continues to amazes me with there inability to remove security tags. I've been forced to drive back to the store twice in as many visits to have the security tags removed. PLUS the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing. After this last trip I'm returning everything I purchased, I'm tired of having to go back to the store just to have a tag removed considering how over my shoulder the staff was... Basically Dillard's you suck... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> HORRIBLE!!  I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone!  They should have known I was coming!!!  \n\nThe food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better!  We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm.\n\nOK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good! \n\n:(  Now I have no more left :(\n\nUnfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint* <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal, but i wanted to give them another shot.  \n\nI ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old, the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Waited for 4 hours only to have multiple people  walk in the door and cut in front of us and tons of other people. After telling the service representative he did not seem to care and continued to help said customer. After informing the manager of our situation we still didn't receive any assistance nor did he seem to care either. Thank goodness this will be the only time we have to come to this sprint store. Avoid at all costs if possible. The employees they had on the floor were completely inadequate obviously due to the amount of time it took for them to handle a customer. What's the point of a waiting list if they are not going to even use it? This is a direct reflection of Sprint's customer service as a whole. The worst part is that this is the corporate store for the area. The other retailers or whatever they are called are much worse. The only thing that went as it should have was when my wife and I finally made it to the desk with a representative. She was very helpful and knowledgeable. She was the one that should have been manager. At least crew lead or something of the sort. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For Phoenix, this is pretty great. In all honesty it is only slightly worse than DC chinatown so we should be pretty proud. (DC just dubs over chains with chinese writing). I agree, not at all comparable to NYC or Chicago's Chinatown but delicious and a great inexpensive grocery store with all the specialties (just no fake purses or as big of a selection of stores). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  2 stars for the curtious staff.  Rooms do not have fridges or microwaves....they can be provided at a charge if $10 (each) per day.  Decent fitness facility, with good running trails (frazier park) nearby. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh?  Legit.  I always get two lengua tacos.  Lengua is Spanish for delicious, so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome (lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best tacos; super savory and always tender).\n\nTake a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal.  The customer is always right.\n\nAt 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right.\n\nThey also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos ($5 as well), but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been frequenting T'cooks bar for 6 years now.  The core of the staff has remained the same, which is quite uncommon in the food and beverage world.  There is a bartender / bar manager / all around good guy, by the name of Jason, that u must ask for....don't tell him I sent ya ;-)  Jeremy and Eric back him up on busy evenings and his nights off.  The food at this joint is at first glance small portions but I assure you, hungry will not be in your vocab upon completion of any entree.  My favorite, and it is back on the menu, is the lobster tortilini.  It is not cheap but it is so friggin' worth it!  paired with a nice white wine or if you've got some more hair on yur b@!!s than I do, maybe something stronger.  They've got every brand and make of gasoline you could ever hope for.  When finished be sure to have some cream cheese brulee with an espresso martini.  Talk about a little jolt of a libation...this will get your eyes poppin' for sure...\n\nT'Cooks is the top notch eating outlet in the Royal Palms Resort.  And if you have not already heard about the architecture and landscaping on the resorts 9 acres...be sure to take a little stroll.\n\nIf your with a date, this place is a sure fire closer!  If you can't close here...just go home and stop dating altogether. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Oh, how I used to love SunUp.  I was a fan when it was still Sonora Brewhouse, and I was a fan after the name change/change of ownership/whatever.  The waitstaff was always sort of iffy, but the patio was comfortable (when smokers weren't around), and the food was pretty consistent.  I was particularly in love with a new addition to the menu - the spicy pulled pork sandwich.\n\nIn search of a good place open on July 4th, I stopped in with a friend, already craving that delicious sandwich.  After waiting a couple minutes to be seated (and not even being acknowledged by anyone when we entered), we were led to a table by an older woman.  She took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over.  It took me a minute to realize they'd changed their menu.  Instead of one with appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burgers, entrees, and desserts, they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu.  And, sadly, the pulled pork sandwich had been discontinued.  I settled on the green chile chicken sandwich of some sort and an iced tea.  The waitress wasn't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant.  Our meals arrived but without the chipotle ketchup we requested.  A few minutes later, the waitress brought it to our table.  There was nothing impressive about my sandwich.  It was fairly blah and unseasoned, and the sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside but tough and hard on the inside.  Shame I paid $1 to upgrade from regular fries.\n\nOnce it came time to pay, the waitress took an exceptionally long time to return our cards and receipts to us.  My companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything.  The place was pretty empty, so I don't really know why service was so bad.  I do know that the new menu leaves a lot to be desired, and unfortunately, I'll be hard-pressed to return in the future. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been dying to try Cajun Queen for a while. I originally heard about it from my sister who was going to meet a friend out there.  I was SERIOUSLY planning to third wheel it and she didn't mind (b/c in her mind it wasn't a date)  .. but when she asked him about me tagging along he responded with a \""you mean she comes on our date\"" Welp... at that point she realized it was a date (duh) and his ego was a bit bruised ... medium story short I never made it out there. \n\nCajun Queen is in an interesting location I haven't explored this part of Charlotte much.... only in passing. It's a tight space inside , we went at an off time so we had ample room but I wonder about dinner time how crowded it can be. Our waiter was super nice and explained the menu to us as well as made some recommendations on the spicy and not so spicy. I am a huge shrimp fan so I had the Diane with Shrimp. It was pretty tasty and spicy to me, and had me stuffed! It appears that they give you huge portions for your entr\u00e9e which is nice. I also had a side of gumbo , which  honestly tasted a bit like chili. This was my first gumbo experience so I'm not really sure what to think in terms of taste but I have heard from a friend who lives in NO that it's not supposed to taste like chili. \n\nI came on a Sunday afternoon so there was no live band , and it was super cold so we couldn't sit on the patio. Overall I thought it was a nice meal and nice place with reasonable prices for the amount of food you receive. The parking is a bit annoying but I guess you can always park on the street! \n\nOh it seems that they run on reservations so I would recommend one! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Awesome food, awesome prices, awesome service!  Decor is something to be desired but the view and food more than makes up for it.  Go and enjoy some of Wisconsin's very best fried cheese curds.  Go for Breakfast  and order a pancake, you will only need one.  For Dinner try any of their specials, I've had them all!  Makes me want to go there tonight.\n\nJust a local <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Charlotte is usually my layover in transit when I cannot have a straight flight. With that being said I'm going from the gate and I do not have the full TSA, parking or any of the extras worries.\n\nThe airport is very clean compared to the others I've been to, the food vendors are decent but lack on healthy eating spots (I try to eat well since I'm about to sit on a plane) and most importantly, the gates are labelled well if I'm in a rush. Did I mention that I love the Southern charm? Well, that's just the nice part of visiting the Southerners. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is about the FOOD only! I'm in town and without a vehicle so naturally I was looking up some tasty delivery options on yelp, when I came across cuisine malaya, I was elated to see that they delivered.  I got my food fast, both dishes came in very nice containers and I was sure i was in for a real treat! Based on other reviewers I had the steamed Popiah  and the beef Char kway teow..\n\nBack to the opening of the containers.... First the steamed popiah, I'll admit I have never had popiah before and they probably would have been better if they were fried.   The popiah consisted of a thick roll stuffed with mostly rice and some other ingredients, it was topped and garnished very nicely, the problem is.... It didn't taste like anything!!!  I'm a firm believer in not eating tasteless food.   \n\nThe char kway teow was similar in appearance to pad see ewe but again, this dish was tasteless..... I mean I couldn't taste any flavors! How does this even happen?? Did they forget to add flavor to my meal???  I ended up only eating a tiny amount of my food... \n\n It's so sad when you have something that looks delicious, but turns out to be a barrel of bland..... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  UGH.\n\nNasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. \n\nSometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was \""stopped up\"" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThis place is filthy. \n\nThe food is atrocious.\n\nThe employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).\n\nYour pal,\nWalter <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\n\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \""look in the back\"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I ordered a pizza at 10:25, just one pepperoni pizza, nothing fancy, and I did not get the pizza until 11:50. They sent me an email confirmation saying it would be 30-40 minutes, which obviously wasn't the case. When I called to inquire after an hour they simply said it was on it's way, no offer for a coupon or a comp pizza or anything. After taking one bite I'm less than satisfied. It's cold and completely unimpressive. To top it off when I had to sign my credit card receipt the delivery person asked me if thy could have my pen bc they left there's at home. I will never order from them again. There are far too many BETTER pizza places to indulge in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Lenscrafters...the standard in \""while you wait\"" glasses, almost exclusively located in malls around the country.  My boyfriend had been wearing glasses taped together on the sides for oh, about 9 months now, so I decided to make him an appointment for new specs.  We were in and out in a matter of two hours, counting the wait time for his new glasses to be made.  The staff were knowledgable and friendly, without being pushy or trying to force him into choosing something he didn't like because they are \""trendy\"" (it's happened to us before!)  They were also running a special, so we got $100 off the frames and lenses, which really helps when your insurance only covers the exam.  All in all, a great experience.  We will be back when I need contacts! :) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have been several times just because it is convenient. Last time, I had two shirts stolen out of my backseat. I went in and told the manager. He acted like I was making it up. I paid to have my car detailed and spent almost $80.00, and it looked like I got the basic wash. They didn't even get all of the tar (my main reason for detailing) off of the guards. I will never go back. I would rather do it myself than be so mad that I wasted the money everytime I go to Danny's. Ok, the owner must be a complete idiot. He will have the guys for immigration in soon asking for green cards. Talk about a \""run for the border\"". Taco Bell. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We went here for Valentines Day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else. We both loved it. The calamari is outstanding and if you get there before 7, they run happy hour which is half off apps and $3 beers. \n\nI had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. Atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being Valentines day. Despite the busyness, the wait staff was very attentive.\n\nMy wife's steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level. We will def be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Guanaquito's was a place my GF found out about through someone at work, and she dragged me along. I was skeptical, but optimistic. I have lived in Panama and Guatemala, and I was looking forward to some basic C.A. farmer food.\n\nI was not disappointed. My stewed chicken was excellent. We ordered an appetizer platter: starch as far as the eye could see. They even had yucitas (casava fries). In Panama, we joked  about yuca being the potato's drier, stringier cousin. But Guanaquito's yucitas brought back fond memories of the campo and drunken evenings sitting in Pio Pio in David. A mixed message for most, I'm sure, but for me it was all good.\n\nThe staff was awesome, explaining for us gringos how to enjoy the fare. And we did enjoy. I'm looking forward to making my way back sometime soon. <|endoftext|>

BTW that move also came with a name change - they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille.\n\nI was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed.  When I read that they had moved - I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything since. The food was totally bland, took forever to get to us, and my hamburger bun was dripping of grease, as if it had been floating in it all day. I was totally displeased with this place. The only reason this review isn't one star is because I didn't see any roaches. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This hotel is horrible!! The customer service has to be as old as the hotel because they have no understanding of what is like to treat a customer correctly! The front desk has attitude, the valet are airheads and the overall atmosphere just sucks! I regret ever staying here and would like to advice anyone on thinking about staying here to STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!! Rooms are small bathtubs have roaches, paint is chipping off the walls.... Ugh just a bad experience! I paid 178 for one night and regret it! I've stayed at motel 6 that are way better than this! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great BBQ!\nIt's a little out of the way, but worth the journey if you're looking for decent BBQ.\nI don't remember seeing any highchairs.  We ended up bringing in our stroller for our daughter to sit in.\nWhile you have to order your food at the counter, there is a wait staff that will bring your food to you and refill your drinks.\nNo alcoholic beverages... (that's why 4 stars). <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I reviewed these idiots back in July and filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against them.  \n\nThe empty platitudes from Heather at Danny's corporate that they do a great job for a good price ... Really?  20+ dollars for a VIP wash and the back is not vacuumed, the windows are streaky, there are still bugs all over the grill and hood?  \n\nOffering me a \""free\"" crappy carwash  or try and intimidate me when I point out the car is not clean is no offer at all.  I do not feel safe patronising this business at this location.  Maybe someone has had good service from another location but stay away from this one.\n\nI actually never expected to get a refund as these folks have over and over demonstrated they DO NOT CARE when you attempt to bring something to their attention. They have the worst customer service I think I have ever experienced anywhere and getting your car washed there is a complete waste of time and money.  They do a crappy job, and you may get items stolen from your car or something broken on your vehicle and they will say it's not their fault.\n\nLos Olivos Car Wash charges 20 dollars for a hand washed car that is immaculate and the staff is pleasant, friendly and honest. Go to Los Olivos and see for yourself.  You will never settle for the inferior work and service at Danny's ever again.\n\nI will post my most scathing review of this horrible business everywhere I can.  Someone will see it and Danny's will NOT get the business of another unsuspecting fool like me.\n\nRead the other reviews on this place.  It's stay away or you are throwing your money away plus you'll get intimidated or insulted for your trouble. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stayed here for a corporate holiday party that was held in their large ballroom and really enjoyed myself. The rooms were satisfactory and the suites were great for post-party gathering. The event itself was beautiful and the food was really great. I really liked the event space layout and the staff was phenomenal. Best of all, the hotel is so centrally located that we were able to walk to all the places we needed to go the next morning. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Charlotte. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I hate trying to find a good nail salon.  Yelp has helped me out on several occasions when I lived in San Jose.  I found a couple of great salons.  When Iain B. send me his review of Dv Nail Salon, I knew I had to try it.  Not only that but it's close to my house.  Score!  \n\nMy daughter and I went in last Satuday.  I figured if I was a walk-in I would have to wait a while.  I think I only waited about 10 mins.  I was greeted warmly, told to pick out a color, and have a seat.  They were busy but what salon isn't busy on a Saturday?  They ladies seemed to have it together though.  They were all working, chatting with their cllients or amoungst themselves but I heard mostly english instead of the usual vietnamese.  My nail tech was Tracy and she was a sweetheart.  She did a great job. A needed a pedicure badly.  She made my toes look beautiful!  She even put the cutest flowers on them too.  I will ask for Tracy next time I go back.  My daughter got a peducture too.  She was a little aprehensive at first but there was another little girl her age in one of the chairs having a pedicure too so she gave it a go.  Her nail tech was very patient. with her and did a great job!  She loved it so now it will become a mother/daughter outing to get our toes polished and pretty. \n\nThe shop was clean and everyone was nice and friendly.  More english was being spoken here then I have heard in any nail salon in a long time.  I like that.  And I appreciate that.  Dv's prices were also resonable.  They have got my business, especially since it's another great spot close to where I live. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy, not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow, I used to think that the Burger here was one of the best ever - not anymore.  \n\nI was in Champaign last week, on a Wednesday evening.  Murphy's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm.  \n\nI ordered a Mega Bacon Cheeseburger and fries.  Sat at the bar, and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy - you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name.  Service here was terrible.\n\nThe burger?  Much smaller than I remember.  The fries, barely edible....they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried.  \n\nAll in all, a terrible meal.  I won't be returning, not with all the other places in town now where you can get some good eats. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been eating at Luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). The new location is nice, but I miss the coziness of the old place. \nThe food has been consistent through the transition, which happened a long while ago by the way. Also, I have read a few other reviews that said Luigi's has left but I talk with him every time I am in. Regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and I recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Definitely one of my favs. Loved the gumbo, grits, and creole shrimp. Live jazz was the cherry on the sundae. Speaking of desserts, I remember being pleasantly surprised with the bourbon pecan pie. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My issue is with Dr. O'sullivan. She's straightforward, no sugar coating, no emotion, no small talk, just strictly to the point. That's usually not my go to type of doctor but besides the personality factor I didn't have any other reason to switch at the time. \nI guess I should have gotten worried when she prescribed Zoloft for me because I was \""depressed\"". I've never been treated for depression nor had any other doctor ever bring it up. I was young, unmarried, still in school and pregnant with horrible morning sickness. Would you be thrilled? I did not take the Zoloft, which now has a huge law suit for birth defects! She also wanted to give me zofran for my morning sickness which I refused to take as well. \nI went into labor at the hospital at 8pm and dilated until about 4 am that morning. Dr. O'sullivan didn't show up until almost 6am. My daughter sat in the birth canal so long that when she was born she was not breathing. My heart dropped when I didn't hear my baby crying. What did the doctor do? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. She stood there looking so confused. The nurses ran the baby over to the table and called a code. Other nurses literally ran in and revived my daughter getting her to breathe. Dr . O'sullivan did not even touch my daughter once while all that happened she just watched. If it wasnt for the amazing staff at good Sam my daughter would not be here or may have had long term effects. Even worse is that the same thing happened to my cousin. Dr O'sullivan was her OB and took a very long time to show up at the hospital as well. My cousin had already had two children so she knew the risks of waiting and told the hospital she's not waiting anymore so go get the doctor on staff. The dr at the hospital delivered her baby with no problems but just imagine if she had waited for Dr. O'sullivan to show up what could have happened. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I went to this Fry's on Friday the 1/24/14 and I was there to pick up 2 veggie trays for a party at work. I picked up 2 veggie trays and fruit juice poured out all over my slacks and I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager. Now remember I said veggie tray not fruit tray, so when I explained this to a manager who finally arrived he said he was not sure why that happened and was going to find out what and how it happened. So in the mean time Jerry Cruz the manager wanted to know what he could do for me, and I suggested he pay my cleaning bill but instead he offered to purchase the different trays I decided to buy. Thank you Jerry for making it right for me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Im gonna sum this up quickly. Booooo!!!! Service/serve was ok, food WASNOT worth what they were charging (cold fries and hard ass bread on the philly cheese steak sandwich). AND I smell like a resturant! Ugh! Won't go back nor will I suggest anyone go there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that, they've lost my clothes before. And now I just got a $110 sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off. They are clearly incompetent. Not only that, the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in. How are your clothes even clean when they come from that? Awful. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Hotel restaurants are just awful!  It's like you have to be mediocre to have a restaurant inside a hotel.  I don't get it!  Wouldn't they WANT you to stay and spend money on their property?? \n\nNevertheless, this place in the Westin hotel is no different.  For starters, the place is sorely outdated.  The decorations look like they're straight out of an 80's music video.  I went with my mom, who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where Chihuly's.  I almost choked on my bread when she asked! \n\nI always go for sushi when it's on the menu at a fish place.  I can't get away from it, plus I need my weekly (or sometimes daily) fill of it!  So I ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad.  The spicy yellow tail was not spicy.  It had a side of \""spicy\"" sauce.  I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.  But it was not happening at this place! \n\nThe thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with.  My tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive ($7) than the fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls.  And DEF not as good!  My mom ordered a bowl of fish soup.  This \""bowl\"" was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving.  It was hardly halfway full.  That's all my mom had ordered for lunch.  It was pretty sad looking.  So she asked for a little more from the server.  The server said that's all she could give her because it was restaurant policy.  Now let me tell you....I've worked at restaurants.  I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. \n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave! Don't say I didn't warn you! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Kid sized portions- left with a starving stomach and a lighter wallet.  My cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full.  My food arrived on a doll size plate, only about 5 bitez. Ordered dessert and was quickly let down by that portion, too...shocker. I have seen children's meals with larger portions.  It would take double the amount of food to satisfy me.\nToo bad because if the portions were better I might have been able to appreciate the quality of the food. <|endoftext|>

I've tried a number of other Thai restaurants in the area and this is my favorite.\n\nI often bring friends and no one has ever disliked their meal here. My favorite things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). The food is always great. \n\nThe service is even better than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. Most times I am surprised at how fast the food comes out. After going here a while they treat you like family. I would definitely recommend it to others! <|endoftext|>

Also, love the giant glasses of iced tea.  \n\nThe service was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat place to go overall. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Eating here right now. For $5 it's a steal here.  Really good. If I want pizza and I'm down here, I'll get it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is my second visit to this store. Kimberly (the woman behind the counter) is the rudest person I have ever met in retail, who does not deserve to be behind the counter of any retail counter. She is cold, un-inviting, and overall appears to hate her job by the scour look on her face.  She is useless when it comes to helping customers and overall she has a \""can't do\"" attitude.  \n\nI lodged a complaint on the corporate website and this store is privately franchised and owned.  I spoke with John the owner and apparently he must have trained Kimberly because his attitude is just as bad if not worse. He didn't show any concern for my complaint nor did he show any empathy for my experience.  He hung up on me twice in conversation. \n\nKimberly followed me out to the parking lot and show aggressive signs of intimidation with my friend and I and in my opinion that was inappropriate and unprofessional. A sales person NEVER follows a customer outside. \n\nAvoid this store at all cost. The post office is around the corner and is much cheaper. I am fling a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  \n\nGood luck John and Kimberly!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love this place - they were very accommodating to me, Peanut and Gramma (she goes often).  Solid wine selection and Gramma says they make a good Margarita.  We all enjoyed all of our food as well.  Great view of the Mon too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Pros:\nGreat ambiance\nService was friendly and attentive\n\nCons:\nKettle one with soda - everyone knows that's soda water right??? not 7-up, gross.\nSalt, salt, salt....we ordered the halibut and the veal, but we couldn't tell the difference, all we could taste was salt.\n\nTwo salty entrees, two cocktails, two salads = $130...ouch no thanks.\n\nI have four more days in this beautiful city, let's see what else I can find... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wow\n\nThis store is huge!  It is at least two to three times larger than their outlet stores at Tangers near Arrowhead, or the one in Anthem. \n\nIn the past I've been hard on the Ralph Lauren Polo Outlet concept.  Their stores are on the small side and they tend to offer clothing that are made specifically for the outlet distribution channel, rather than what you would find in a department store.  In essence, knockoffs of a knockoffs.\n\nWell here, they actually have their normal branded clothing at a flat 30% off. I guess that is what it costs them to be in Macy's and Dillard's. I also found it refreshing that they had a Tall section as well. Nice! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's a nice enough place with a decent selection of drinks (and a not-bad post-9pm happy hour), but I'd steer clear of the food.  If the portions were large and delicious, the prices would be more than reasonable, but sadly that's not the case.  I've never really enjoyed anything I've eaten here, and the downright terrible burger is what prompted me to write the review warning folks away (\""medium rare\"" came out \""well done\"" and no one noticed or even asked how it was).\n\nSo come here if you want to grab a drink with your friends on Walnut Street.  But I, for one, will be going someplace else first if I want dinner too. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience. \n\nOn a blazing hot Friday afternoon I left work early and drove all the way down to McDowell to pick up some toys for my dog. I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close, and my watch was just about at 4:30. I reached to open the door, unsure if it would be locked-- to my pleasant surprise, it was still open, I was so excited. The cashiers allowed me to head back to the warehouse-- again, I was relieved! I made a beeline for the toys and just a few feet before I reached them one of the workers pops out, literally stands in the middle of the aisle with his arms crossed (as if I were trying get backstage at a concert), and tells me the business is closed and that I had to leave. I told him that I just needed to grab a couple of toys, that I would need 2 minutes (under the circumstances, I would have been quick), but he wouldn't let me pass. When I politely persisted he asked me what toys I was interested in, and told me he would get them for me. I told him that I couldn't possibly know what they had in stock and that I just needed to visually see what they had (and how the heck do you describe some of these dog toys anyway??). No dice, he told me that I had to go. Really?? \n\nInflexible, embarrassing, and a total wasted trip. I was steamed. Rather than ask for a manager when I was agitated, I decided to drive home and email customer service. They emailed back the following Monday and told me, essentially, the employee did was he was supposed to do, blaming it on concern for customer safety with all of the heavy equipment they utilize after hours in the warehouse. Mind you that I had been let in building, that nobody stopped me from entering the warehouse, that it had maybe just turned 4:30, that there were other customers there, that there was no heavy equipment in sight and that I had asked for 2 minutes. They were perfectly fine with their employee telling me that I had to leave, and they made no effort to keep a repeat customer.\n\nBummer, I was so excited to learn of Ryan's Pet Supplies a couple of years ago-- and indeed, they have a great selection at terrific prices, I considered it worth the burden of driving into a bad area with restricted hours. I had given them all of my business ever since. Now I will never go back again, and I will let everyone know that Ryan's Pet Supplies couldn't care less about their customers. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I think that it is difficult to differentiate between Lexus service centers as they all adhere to to relatively high standards, but I have to say that Bell Lexus is a a pure pleasure to have my car serviced at.  Like most dealerships I was not only able to book my appointment online but also able to get the first time and date I requested.  When you get to the covered service drive, you are always greeted and walked into your service consultant.  I work with Debi at Bell Lexus and she not only gets everything processed and my car in for service quickly but also always has a loaner ready to go.  This time it was a 2010 RX which made the fiancee happy because she is looking at one as her next car possibly.  It gave us the perfect opportunity to drive it around for the morning and see if it was something that we truly liked. I think we are in trouble because we both definitely thought it was a great car for her.  Back to the service though. I had my car in at 8:30 am and I had a call by noon that my 15,000 mile service was not only done but also my brakes had been replace (under warranty) at no extra charge.  I was back in my car (which they also washed) by 1:30 in the afternoon and on my way.  Overall, great service and experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is far from any Sho gun I've been to. My roll was terrible. Boring, bland, not spicy like described, too warm and avocados were brown. Tasted like grocery store sushi. Kids meal was good, tempura...veggies were good but seafood was not. I will not go back here. Hostess and other servers seemed nice, mine had no personality and did not know the menu at all. I sure miss California sushi places. Any suggestions? Phoenix area??? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Since I was 8 years old I have been coming here. I am 24 now. That's sixteen years as a customer. We order about 4 times a year for the past few years.\n\nLet me detail some changes. Instead of serving their food in the take out boxes many people associate with Chinese they changed this procedure about a year ago. Now they come on cheap plastic plates with a top that can be sealed. Why does this matter? The volume of food you get in these plates is less than what it used to be. So I let that go, I kept ordering. My orders usually end up about 45-50 bucks.\n\nYesterday, I had my worst service and food that I have ever received. I MADE a yelp account because I am so pissed off. The Teriyaki chicken was hard, rock hard. It tasted like 2 day old leftovers. The kind that were left under a lamp. The PuPu Platter which costs 9.50 a piece contained jack sh1t. I ordered TWO of them , that is 19 dollars of Pu Pu Platter and the result I took a picture of because I couldn't believe it. \n\nThis is what 19 dollars looks like : http://i.imgur.com/TZhEuV5.jpg\n\nI called back, and was told this was a normal portion. Lol. \n\nI have been going here for years, and they finally lost me as a customer yesterday. I can say for certainty that I will never order from this place again, and neither should you. \n\nAs an aside I added up 50 an order 5 times a year for 16 years, me and my family have probably spent around 4000 dollars at this one place throughout that time.\n\nBye bye. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This is my favorite breakfast place.   Seriously, their food is amazing.   For starters, I love that they have the traditional thin waffle.   My personal favorite is the waffle with strawberries.   And it comes with a strawberry syrup.  \n\nTheir bacon is the best in town.  Thick cured and flavorful bacon.  Yum!  The staff is always friendly and the wait time is never as bad as other restaurants. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm a business traveler for over 20 years, and my experience with the Charlotte, NC airport Hertz location would rate as the worst I've ever experienced. I'd confirmed various details of my agreement with Hertz's 800# but when I got to the counter (after waiting half an hour at the airport for a shuttle van that never came -- I eventually took the National shuttle and walked over to Hertz!!) the manager claimed they couldn't abide by what we'd been told and as a result our bill was almost triple the original reservation. Attempts to rectify with the manager on duty when returning the car were met with \""that's not our problem\"" and \""well, you signed the agreement.\""  It's also worth adding that I've gotten nowhere with Hertz's corporate 800# (I was left on hold for THIRTY MINUTES) and their website (no response to email submission). I've never been treated so poorly. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> It is a huge airport, but that's not the fault of anything but the passengers who take flights in, out, and through there. Getting around takes time, but you can do it. There is a remote terminal that requires a trip through the TSA Goon Squad on some connections, and that is not a good thing.\n\nOn the upside, it's rarely going to be closed for weather issues. And, most important of all, it has free Wifi! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm not sure if I missed something because this was definitely not a 5 Star dinner! \n\nMy sister and i had wanted to try somewhere we hadn't been and this has been on both of our lists to try. We made a reservation (no need) for 7pm on Saturday. We get there and we are the ONLY people in the place!!! On a Saturday!! I was completely shocked and felt horrible for our server and busser since they had to actually be there! \n\nI will say the decor was nice Red, Red, and more Red! Comfy chairs and a nice ambiance....would've been better if there were others in the place!! \n\nOk so out came the corn bread which was One of my 3 favorite things that night Delicious!! Second best my Margarita(s) that our server made was Awesome!! Third the Sorbet Palate Cleanser it was Strawberry Cantaloupe Delish! The problem is none of this makes a meal :( \n\nThey sent out an Amuse Bouche which was Seared Tuna with a Vidalia Onion something....FISHY so over cooked tasted worse than Tuna Fish it was just bad! We split the Duck and Corn Fritters, Flavorless and barely any duck in them. I had the Watermelon Salad it was supposed to be served with a Frisee salad not a Spinach salad, along with some Duck Prosciutto that was also missing from the plate. My sister enjoyed her salad... \n\nFor my Entree I ordered the T-bone Lamb...Over cooked not Rare-Medium Rare so I sent it back. I don't get lamb enough so when I find it on a menu I order it! So now I'm just sad because its not how I had wanted it but more so because when they did give it back it was cooked good but the Roasted Cauliflower Puree it was sitting on was like glue! Gross! The Lamb was so hard to cut that I had to stop cutting and breathe because it was like a workout! In Retrospect I should've just picked it up and eat it off the bone like my sister told me to do, but i was being a lady! \n\nOur server was very nice and by no means was this disastrous evening in any shape or form her fault! She even had taken our Dessert off because of the lamb having to be sent back. We had the Peaches and something...not bad but not great \n\nAll in all this meal was just sad! From the minute we sat down and realizing we chose the wrong place to go, but now we can cross it off our lists and call it a day! \n\n* I should say that by the time we were into our meal they did get 7 other customers so at least that was a little better... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I had the spicy beef with vegetables and my son had the Singapore noodles. My sauce was missing flavor as equally my veggies and beef were bland. Hospital food is better. The rice was cooked with too much water so it was mushy, so when I told the server he said he would get rice from a different pot. That means they have two types of rice and they serve the lowest quality first. The second bowl he brought was medium grade long grain rice. Don't eat here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Been here 3 times and no more for me. No matter if I go for lunch or dinner, weekday or weekend, the food quality is poor. Steaks are tasteless and tough, chicken is overcooked and dry. My friends had ribs and won't order them again. Salads are extra with the meal and pretty sad. Only thing I really like was the fried pickle appetizer. Prices are above average for everything, and the mixed drinks are weak. Place is in need of an overhaul on remodeling, lobby is musty and outdated. Location is prime and the place really makes a killing on boat and lake traffic docked onsite, which is probably why they stay in business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Two stars only because it's the Christmas season and I'm feeling generous. \n\nThese guys are a mess. We ordered by phone and went to pick up.  The unpleasant young woman at the counter had no record of the order.  The guy (equally unpleasant) was taking a steady stream of phone orders and appeared close to meltdown, rolling his eyes at the customers' questions.\n\nWhen he finally got off the phone he came over and just looked at me (it was now 20 minutes of waiting) and I told him what we ordered and the name it was under.  He shook his head and came out with a lukewarm box.  When I reminded him we had ordered a salad, he turned around without a word and grabbed a salad and gave me the total ($32 for a medium and a salad!?!)\n\nI was hungry, tired and frustrated so I paid and got home to find they had not (as we requested) put forks in with the salad (we were at a hotel).\n\nThe pizza  - well, that's what a pizza place is all about, isn't it?\nIt was okay.  Nothing special.  I'd give it a B-.  \n\nI could have ordered from Papa Johns and would have known what we were getting.  And it would be cheaper.  And they would deliver.  And I bet they would have actually been pleasant.  And maybe the pizza would have been hot.\n\nMerry Christmas, Streets of New York. I hope tomorrow goes better for you than today did. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, got off to a bad start.  We were told that the wait would be 30 minutes, was closer to and hour and fifteen.  We were shuttled from the Arizona Grand so leaving wasn't a good option for us.\n\nFinally we were seated, two of the staff recommend the spiced pork.  I did not think much of it, but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their meals and the portions were ample.  I wish I would have ordered something else. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wonderful bake-it yourself pizza.  My friend and I always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese.  There's a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that's great as well.  They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also.  Service went downhill there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing, because they were wanting to clean up for the night.  But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice again.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality.  A winner! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Had an opportunity to eat here last night, as it was the first time in many years since my last visit.\n\nThe staff was friendly, the location was clean, and the food was good.\n\nI usually do not visit such places in the evenings, but the younger one wanted to have some pancakes, so where do you go.......she said  \""The Original Pancake House\"".\n\nThis has a more limited menu than most places, but it is not lacking in the pancakes and breakfast department.\n\nI can see why this place is a staple, and I could not imagine trying to get in the doors for Breakfast as it is surely crowded with regulars and hungry people.\n\nGood Value for the money.\n\nNCFoodGuy <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wonderful as always. It's our go-to for a quick bite to eat. Your kids will like the Wisconsin Mac n Cheese. Mine do. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Soo good! The atmosphere and the service was great. The chicken fried steak is amazing!  Puts me to sleep every time. A must try. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is great for lunch if you are in a hurry. Tons of seating and minimal wait time. Parking is okay though you probably will have to settle for the street or dirt lot across the street. \n\nThe portions are huge! I would dare say you could split a plate and ask for sides of soup and egg rolls. The kung pao is seasoned well with lots of veggies. It is made with dark chicken meat, zucchini, red bell pepper and carrot. The salt and pepper shrimp dish is great. The lemon chicken is very tasty as well. It has breaded pieces of white chicken breast fried crisp and served in a lemony sauce. \n\nThe service is good though about five different waitresses will hit your table from beginning to end. Every time I looked up it was a new person bringing me soup, lunch, water, and the bill. Some smiled - some looked like they were really focused on the job at hand. \n\nOverall it was a good experience. We've done take out a few times and it is also quick and easy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  There are so many more places you can spend your hard earned cash and get a much better meal. Telling the truth is not slander.  \n\nYes, the chips and salsa are good. They, however, are not the meal.   I find the food to be bland with a mushy texture.  For example, the picadillo tastes like something you could buy a mix at a grocery store and make at home.  \n\nThe restraunt is cute-looking, but dirty.  The rafters have dust bunnies.  The last unfortunate meal I ate there, we were seated by a group.  The restraunt was not busy at all.  The server never came to collect my card so we could leave.  I ended up taking it to the hostess.  If you want sub-par food, sucky service, and a dirty restraunt do go here. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Wow! I was just here a few months ago. How fast can a burger place go down hill? I wish I would have read the recent reviews before eating here. I would have gone to In-n-Out in a heart beat. \nJust like previous patrons have stated, the burger tastes like it is freezer burned, the 'Endless' fries are not very good, the service is lacking, the bartender assumed I wanted Med. their version is very pink and greasy as well. \nOnly positive is the beer. \nNext time I'll drive out of my way to a close Red Robin. Everything is much better there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been a loyal customer here for 15 years. The staff and food are great. The prices cant be beat, especially during lunch hours. A great variety of food from seafood to vegetarian to meat and poultry dishes. This is truly a Phoenix gem!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Such a happening place with so little service.  Lots of neighborhood restaurants pour your bottle of wine for the table and refresh glasses. Similar establishments, with great ambience, also ask if you would would like another bottle. This Postino's service does not and their bottles aren't cheap. \n\nGranted, plenty of servers milling around.  Bored support clean off tables but forget to wipe off chairs and at least one appears literally stoned.\n\nI guess the real question is why the server recorks the bottle with a temporary cork after the first and only service pour. Doesn't the Red wish to breath?\n\nThere were a few service highlights: tastes of the wines freely offered and a quick response for heat for any desert rats (hey! It's 60 degrees, brr.)\n\nButcher block is always a highlight and I won't give up on this fun place just yet. It simply needs some good floor management. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have used A To Z Housekeeping a couple of times and have always been happy with the results. I appreciate the professionalism and excellent customer service: appointments are routinely confirmed, and you will receive a call when the crew is on the way. The cleaning is not entirely perfect (there are some cut corners, such as parts of my rugs that didn't get vacuumed), but overall, the house is clean after they have been working for an hour (and I'm pretty discerning...). The ladies are nice and cheery, and they do get quite a bit done. This is my favorite cleaning service: others I've used just don't feel right. This one does. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Ive never had the food here, just drinks.\n\nThis is probably one of the most authentic British Pubs in the valley, proof by the Brit owner cracking jokes on the mic behind the bar.\n\nThey have a great tap and bottle selection, and their mixed drinks are pretty good as well. Very friendly staff, kind of slow sometimes, but very accommodating. The decor is nice, just kitchy enough. The pool tables are cheap, and I believe they have darts as well.\n\nA great place to start or finish your night in Central Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well I tried this place for the 1st time.. and I have to say.. crab puff.. good... dumplings.. good.. eggrolls.. not so good.. \n$37 take out order including tip NOT WORTH IT.. \nI couldn't even eat the szechaun shrimp and scallops.. HORRIBLE.. I had 2 bites and I was nervous to eat the rest cause there was a funny taste.. nothing like szechaun I have ever had ever.. no veggies.. just juice and prob 10 shrimp and 6 scallops in a big container of juice. \nSooo I guess I will continue to search for a good chinese restaurant in phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Wonderful TJ's in the same strip mall as Whole Foods.  Wow.

I have eaten at every good barbecue spot from Kansas City to North Carolina and not once have I come close to the greatness that I experienced today in this joint and I live right here in Phoenix.\n\nI got the sampler and it was worth every penny!  I've never experienced a more flavorful, juicy, meaty rib in all of my travels! The pulled pork was so tender with just the right amount of smokiness....mmmmm. I've never had smoked lamb, but will dream about it from this day forward. They make a minty sweet sauce to go along with it and it is a real treat!\n\nI give this family five thumbs up for starting this place and serving the best 'que of all time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I've been going to this hospital long before it became part of the CMC system. The staff is great especially the nurses, but the amount of time that you have to wait to see a doctor in the emergency room is ridiculous. Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well. The rest of the time that I spent there showed me that the ER needs a serious refresher course in triage. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The eggplant bites are amazing!  Everything we tried on our first visit was top notch and very reasonable. I am so impressed with/obsessed with their buttermilk pie that I found a recipe online and baked one at home.  Pales in comparison to theirs!  We'll definitely be back soon! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I go to Denny's for one thing.  Their good old fashioned turkey club sandwich.  I tried the closest one (2120 E. Cactus Rd.) but will not go back.  Their waitresses act like they never made it out of training and are quick to blame the cooks for their long delays and messing up orders.\n\nSo I have gone a few times to their location at 3205 E. Bell Rd..  Today, as I was picking up the fourth quarter of my turkey club, A ROACH WAS CRAWLING AROUND UNDER IT.\n\nThe manager ultimately came over and said she had been there 3 months and that hasn't happened before.  I said, \""Three months?  This Denny's has been here a lot longer than you.  You call that an excuse?\""  \n\nYes, she gave me another to go at no charge for either.  The waitress who made it up told me she made it herself and is sure there are no roaches in it.  So that is what it takes to compensate for a dirty kitchen?\n\nPrior to the last few months, I haven't set foot in a Denny's in twenty years.  Now I know why! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Never going to any Hooters again. 1) Flat Ass everywhere. Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you want true Mexican food at a very reasonable price, and your plate not just full, but spilling over with spicy delights, this is THE place! I will definitely come back here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'll be short, and just get to the point on this one:\n\nThe only reason I managed to give this place 2 stars was because they definitely gave you good sized portions for the price.  However, a large portion of nasty, is still just nasty, regardless of how much they give you.  The Chicken Fried Steak (their pride and joy) was bland and the only flavor was grease.  I don't mean the typical \""its a fried dish\"" grease flavor, no i mean it tasted like after they pulled it out of the fryer they dipped it in the oil vat.  The gravy was nondescript and flavorless.    Side options were nothing special, they seem to rave about the cole slaw, but it is not my cup of tea, so I passed.  This place seems like the type of establishment that if you are a regular then you get stellar service, if you are not, then oh well to you.  Funny, because how do people get to be a new regular if you aren't giving decent service to the new guest.\n\nTo sum it up, people swear by this place. I however, have sworn off this place.  I don't get it, I left feeling ripped off and revolted that I even ate that junk (now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good chicken fried steak, this just was not it for sure!) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What a cool place! It's a winning combo of college dive/local institution and Guy Fieri hangout.\nThe selection of breakfast and some lunch items is vast. Want pancakes? 42 different means of eating it. I haven't seen a Dutch Baby on a menu in ages! It's what would happen if your souffl\u00e9 fell on hard times into a pancake and was working it's way towards turning tricks as a bread pudding. Dense, moist *pan cake* with a fried dough-ish edge. It'll feed a family of four and here it's under $8. I can't have much sugar and was given a cute little pitcher of hot sugar free chemical juice o drizzle on it - perfect. All syrups should be served warm and they are here, bonus!\nMy son had the crepe Florentine (yes, he's weird) and a hot chocolate and both were delicious. My husband's corned beef was an interesting mix of fresh corn beef with a spicy kick and firm potatoes - a winner. The pancakes that accompany practically everything but a pancake order are think and fluffy and perfect. Best I've had outside of Dottie's in SF.\nWe were originally sent there for the coffee and their unique habit of giving you actual heavy cream with it. We didn't order coffee. Idiots, I know. \nThe staff is unique: a preppy college kid with Death Metal tattoo he surely regrets on his bicep, a large African American man that is confrontational more than welcoming but in a good \""I know everything and there's nothing I can't handle\"" way who actually breaks into a smile that changes his whole demeanor. \nThe total was a bit over $30 for the 3 of us and we each had probably half our meal left over. \nIt was crowded, loud and definitely worth a visit. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The Biltmore has two courses: the Adobe and the Links. I get out there as often as I can, and these are my favorite courses in town to play. Apparently it isn't often enough because I can't seem to shimmy my score much under 90 with any frequency. \n\nAnyhow, of the two, I prefer the Links. It is much more picturesque and manages to frame more of the southwestern desert landscape. The 16th hole on the backside of the Links is one of the best views of the city . . .\n\nThe Adobe is more old-school, and easier (not that I have the right to call any golf course \""easy\""). It is rolling and green with less water than the Links and much more room for error as many of the fairways bleed together. There are more trees on Adobe and it almost feels like you're no longer in Arizona . . . until you realize that the sun is about to set and it's still well over a hundred degrees. \n\nThe restaurant/bar offers good fare at reasonable prices and the air conditioning is always blasting in the summer months. There is GPS on all the carts and the staff is friendly and helpful. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Best thing about here is the view.  Went for Sunday brunch and was very disappointed.  Poor selection, just a mix of your average breakfast fair; grits, eggs, biscuits.  Eggs were cold and the fresh fruit wasn't fresh.  There wasn't much to choose from on the lunch menu.  Worst thing was the loud dance music.  I actually really like electronic music, but not at 1pm on a Sunday overlooking a lake.  Next time I'll just drive 5 more minutes for a better restaurant and enjoy the view as I drive over the bridge. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had no problem redeeming the 30-50 coupon. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. \nThe clothes came out clean, except one that said they couldn't take the stains off without damaging the item, that item was charge which I don't think it should; since it was not cleaned. \nThe price on my personal opinion it's very expensive. I took 11 pieces and paid with coupon over $80. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Amazing food! The dragon eggs appetizer was great. We got the mix of steamed and crispy, but my buddy and I both agreed we preferred the crispy texture to the steamed. The sauce was tangy with some sweetness that was offset perfectly with the jalape\u00f1o slices.\n\nAs I do with a new Thai spot, I opted for the Pad Thai with chicken, my friend got the panang curry with a mix of beef and chicken. The Pad Thai was honestly one of the best I've ever had, and hands down the best in Phoenix. It was spicy, the noodles were sticky and delicious. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The presentation was impeccable,\n\nThe panang curry was not what either of us are used to as it was red opposed to the normal green, but it was super smooth, almost smoky and crazy flavorful. It wasn't clumpy and very creamy. The only downside was the $2 charge to sub brown rice for the traditional jasmine rice.\n\nI would highly recommend Wild Thaiger to anyone town. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> On a recent trip to Chambana my family stopped here to celebrate my sister's graduation from UIUC and were quite pleased.  To start, the wine list was decent with selections from the west coast to Burgundy and Bordeaux, though they were slightly more marked up that I've been used to in Chicago.  However, the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation Saturday.  While I don't fault them for that I must comment that it didn't seem like they had tried to shove extra tables into the restaurant so it shouldn't have taken 3 hours for dinner, especially since we ordered quite quickly after we were seated.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers.  The arancini was satisfying though plain, and the shrimp skewers were well done.  The entrees were bold options that suffered only slightly from less than perfect execution and definitely warrant a return trip.  I enjoyed the pan roasted duck with goat cheese polenta and roasted beets, while my family selected their daily special (a salmon dish) or the hangar steak topped with bacon and a fried egg.  \n\nAs I mentioned, the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip.  Hopefully on my next trip to Chambana the kitchen will be less burdened and I'll be able to enjoy my meal at a slightly less leisurely pace. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've been eating there for years, it is classic Phoenix! The sandwiches are artfully made to your exact specifications and I love how you can taste every ingredient in every bite. That is their standard of tasty quality! My fave is Where's the Beef with a portion of turkey, ask for shredded cheese! I also like the pastrami on dark rye with avocado, shredded cheese and coleslaw! My favorite place to sit is in the wine room unless the weather is nice, then outside is the place to be! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What a wonderful experience!  Don't believe the negative reviews... Those are from spoiled like kids with \""first world problems\"".., look it up on Youtube. This place has old world charm in the heart of bustling downtown, and a spirit of a yesteryear we could all learn from. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The receptionist was not friendly, and wears no name tag so I didn't know who was greeting me.  She actually never said \""hello\"" and never smiled.\n\nLong wait times, so schedule when you have a lot of time and bring a good book.  \n\n\n\nThe doctor removed several freckles for no reason at all apparently, because she didn't explain why, leaving me with scars that I did not want.\n\nCan't say this was a good experience and I won't be back.\nLook for a doctor who thoroughly explains what she is doing and why.    I prefer a doctor who answers questions thoroughly, especially since the wait time was so long.   I expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I had my first ever eye exam at Providence Eye & Laser Specialists, and they were absolutely incredible. Everyone there was extremely patient and pleasant. They walked me through the entire process, and I believe I received excellent care. Dr. Engle was excellent, and I look forward to continuing to work with Providence Eye. I never imagined that I'd be thrilled about going to an eye doctor, but that is the case with this wonderful office! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I stopped using their services in March 2007 because everytime I went there, they would give me grief over the slightest dings on my windshield just to upsell and high-pressure me to get it fixed when it didn't need fixing.  After I stopped going there, they started pressuring me at home by calling me several times, despite the fact that I told them several times not to call me anymore.  I called the Phoenix Police and they suggested that I contact my phone company and it turned out that I had a feature to block specific phone numbers from calling me.  I blocked them and haven't heard from them since. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I don't understand why this place is so popular.  I've been there 4 times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently, I ordered a Del Monico sandwich and the thing was dripping with oil.  The beer list is decent. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Every single time I walk into the walmart at bell/tatum I regret it.  3pm on a Wed. Customer service has 13 people in line. Walked in the door to 8 people in line. The front end manager, Sheila, told me rudely to move and stop blocking traffic in the aisle. However once we blocked traffic they found 2 more cashiers for this nightmarish line. Always worth it to go to a walmart further from home over this one. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I can say that after my second trip to Phoenix, I'm a super fan of the city. When my guy asked where I wanted to stay, I really hoped for the Embassy Suites. \n\nWe were lucky to lock in great rates in the middle of Spring Training. The hotel was filled with fans from all over, some from my hometown San Francisco. \n\nI love the pool here. It's a very large pool and gets sun almost 80% of the day. Weather permitting, you'll find me sun tanning by the pool all day. The indoor atrium is great, lots of cute turtles and fish in the pond. I just loved the natural indoor park and taking pictures.\n\nThey have a decent gym, so I could stay on my daily workouts. Treadmills with Tv's, basic weights and cardio, headphones are towels provided. \n\nI like the suites, we can feel at home and stock our fridge with fun snacks and champagne or we can decide to order in room service from Omaha. Otherwise it's a very nice home away from home, in Phoenix. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Among the best restaurants in Chambanavoy (I know that's not saying a whole lot, but still!)\n\nTapas is an awesome concept, and Luna does it well. They always have many small plates to choose from. Even though I'm vegetarian there are always plenty of things on the menu for me.\n\nFood has ranged from mediocre to very good. Pesto burgers were definitely the former (I mean seriously, if you're going to mention pesto, shouldn't there be pesto involved in the dish?), roasted garlic was definitely the latter (so simple, so cheap, so tasty). I have to dock a star just because at Luna's price, I don't expect to see any mediocre dishes - and I've definitely had a few there.\n\nService has been very nice and friendly, but also very slow (and it's never been all that busy when I've been there, so that can't be used as an excuse). Put two hours on that meter and set a timer on your phone for 1:55 just in case.\n\nIt's a little spendy (expect to spend $25+/person + drinks), but if you want a nice meal in Chambanavoy this is about as good as it gets. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Clean fast and the dr is great.   Highly recommend. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place isn't bad. It's in a not so great location (tucked in the back corner of a dead shopping plaza) but the food is pretty darned good. You go inside and the decor is loud, yet drab. The walls are painted a striking teal, accompanied with a bright red. Yet it's not very well lit, and the lights look like they  need replacing. \n\nAnyways, we went there for dinner and the service was fast, and the servers were friendly. Our food came out quickly and hot. I really liked the crab puffs. Very good. It was also nice to get free hot tea and water - something I miss about a lot of Phoenix Asian based eateries. The food wasn't too greasy and tasted great. The chicken chow mein tasted a lot like Panda Express, but wasn't nearly as greasy. On average, for this time of day, the avg price for a meal was $10. Appetizers ran the gamut from $2 to $7 (on avg). \n\nI will definitely be adding this to my list of regular haunts. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great selection of fun stuff!  We stopped by on our way to Chicago and it was a perfect break in the trip to stretch our legs and browse. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love the ambiance in this place: cozy brick cottage with stained glass windows, usually not too crowded. Very warm and a great place to drink your Sunday away with an all-day happy hour. \n\nAlthough I am not a huge fan of their standard draft beers, I LOVE some of the seasonals they've brought in. The Risky Red (triple IPA), the Milk Stout, and the Barley Wine are all among my favorites. If those three would become full-timers, I would probably never go home.\n\nSome of the food is pretty good, although a lot of the stuff if just okay. Get the blue cheese burger (or, just order a side of the blue cheese sauce and put it on EVERYTHING!) or the pork chile verde. Both are winners!\n\nDespite some of its flaws, I love coming to SunUp. Always a good experience. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 5-stars for Papa John's? Am I crazy?\n\nYes. Probably.\n\nBut it really is worth of the rating. Why?\n\n- So easy to order online; brilliantly intuitive and logical\n- The inside of the store is spotless - I've never seen it in disarray\n- Staff is friendly and efficient\n- Consistent quality; there's no hoping the pizza is as good as a previous time - it just is\n- Never greasy\n- Quite possibly the best \""well done thin crust\"" pizza I've ever had in the Madison area. It holds-up without flopping over, even when piping hot, and it's always perfectly cooked, without being burned or overly charred. \n\nI'm not a fan of their commercials or PJ's personal philosophies. That said, I have yet to find a better thin crust in Madison. I'll keep looking, though. <|endoftext|>

I should have known better but I was right by there so I went. My suggestion is to never step foot in this rat hole of a\"" business\"" the people and service suck. I give it negative 5 stars. Go to andys down the street, I've been going for years and they aren't expensive. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stopped in at Klavon's last weekend for the first time. I stopped in around 8pm, and even though it seemed like the neighborhood was deserted, Klavon's was packed! Very popular spot!  \n\nIf you are on the Strip in PGH, you have to check this place out. Taking a step into Klavon's is like taking a step back in time. This place was originally an old drugstore/ soda fountain from the 1920's. The inside is all original complete with 3 old telephone booths, stained glass windows, beautiful counter top, fancy chrome soda fountains, and several glass display cases displaying items from times past! Stop in here for a quick lunch and a shake or an ice cream cone.. or share a $20 Super Bowl Sundae with friends.. if you dare! ;) <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food here is a mediocre 2.5 stars at best. A lot of it was fried and while they do have a few salads and few special daily entrees the food was still sad overall. I had the Caesar Chicken wrap one night with underdone fries...it was OK. I also had the Chicken Primavera pasta which was actually tasty but needed way way more fresh veggies to make it somewhat healthy...they really skimped on the fresh ingredients here. Other than that the chicken strips, onion rings, fish filet and the like were all super fried. The chicken or veggie quesadilla were also OK but I'd just hop a cab anywhere for something a little fresher.\nThe beer lines seemed stale here so I'd order the bottles or stick to cocktails which were made well.\nThat aside the staff was all friendly and on top of things. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm a fan of Danny's Car Wash. I use to get 50% off of car washes being that I was an ASU employee, but apparently the corporate deal for all businesses ended in 2012. I don't usually get a car wash unless I'm getting a deal so don't forget to check the websites for $4 off coupons. They do a good job, except if you want your trunk vacuum, you have to tell them or pop the trunk so they get the message. My car is always cleaned perfectly and the service is fast. Definitely we keep coming here especially since it's less than a mile from my house. The only thing that I hate is that they always try to sell you gas, an oil change or some detailing. Just say no and they usually leave you alone. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.\n\nThe food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \""Chinese\"" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed.\n\nI've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.\n\nThe only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Before now, I've never been ignored by sales associates when the store is virtually empty. Maybe the exhaustion from all of the weekend's sales drained all of the sales luster. Despite my fitting room request light being lit for over 5 min with no attendant ever coming to my assistance, I still managed on my own. Spending over $100 at an establishment deserves at least a little customer assistance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.   \n\nMy only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This review is based on how well the school prepared their past students for high school. My son just went to 8th grade there. \nIt seemed like a majority of the kids started at a very young age and goes there through junior high. Saying this, the school has one method and one method of teaching which I would say is not good for the student. The students will struggle once they leave the school cause they only understand one method. \nMy son was in the lowest pre-algebra class. He was struggling with the method because all the other kids grew up learning this method. The teacher Mr. Bitter even told our son that he shouldn't go into Algebra 1-2 in high school. Well he went into public high school and struggled a little but nothing a tutor couldn't help him with. He's now doing really well in Geometry. Another former student that was in the same grade as my son was in honor math. Anyways, they are now both in public school and the same Geometry class. My son is doing better than the junior high honor student. \nAlso, another former junior high student from the school was a honor student and went to the same public high school. After two weeks of school she was failing classes and moved back to PVCP for high school. This shows that they did not prepare the kids for high school. \nMy son is in honors Spanish 3-4 at the public school. He said that the 8th grade Spanish teacher was teaching the same thing as he is learning now in honors 3-4. This tells me the teacher doesn't know how to progress the students correctly. Don't just push them through a class but learn to teach. \nSo overall, I feel that this school does NOT prepare the kids for high school or college correctly. It was a big mistake to send my kid there. Save your money and send them to public school. If your worried about Christian values then teach them at home. That's what parents are there for. It's not the schools responsibility to teach these values. <|endoftext|>

They always order a decent number of new releases so you shouldn't have a problem getting a copy of any new issue.  In addition to comics they have t-shirts, posters, card games, toys, candy and all sorts of other geeky junk.  \n\nIf it's something they don't carry in their store let them know and they'll find you a copy.  The staff is friendly and happy to help you find whatever you are looking for... or make some suggestions if you're just getting in to comics.\n\n(Watch out for the swarms of kids on the weekends.  They come to hang around all day playing Pokemon and can really crowd the place.) <|endoftext|>

The place has a chill feel to it, so it's a great place to take a date. \n\nPostino has an extensive wine list and also offers an awesome variety of beers. Their beer list includes your basic domestics, higher end domestics, and a handful of tasty imports.\n\nThe food is amazing as well, with the highlight being the bruschetta. When ordering the bruschetta, you choose any four of eleven yummy choices. None of the eleven are bad, however my favorites are the brie and apples with fig spread, Mozzarella with tomato and basil, salami with pesto, and the warm artichoke spread.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is the place to be and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nGreat food, awesome wine list, good beer selection, nice ambience, and reasonable prices give Postino five stars. <|endoftext|>

That gives you Texaz.\n\nThis place features some of the finest chicken fried steak I've had the pleasure of eating.  It was accompanied by genuine mashed potatoes, buttery corn, and a hearty biscuit.  The portions are as generous as the brim of a texan's hat.\n\nThis is also one of the few places you'll find Arizona where you can find Shiner Bock, the finest Texas beer.  If you hurry there now, you can probably still get the Shiner Bohemian Black Lager - a fine tasty beverage.\n\n(They serve beers in a bottle accompanied by a curiously small frosted glass.  If you're not from the southwest, don't be alarmed.  I hear it's \""normal\"" in the desert lands.)\n\nAll in all, the food was delicious and the owners have instilled a genuine appreciation of the customer that shines through in the service.  This place is about as fine of a casual dining spot as I've found in my travels!\n\nBring your appreciation for Conway Twitty and a hearty appetite.  Yee-haw! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a fan. I was expecting much better, even from a breakfast-all-day diner, because I've raved over similar diners in other review (see: CJ's in Seattle and Izzy & Nat's in Battery Park). However, no. I have no interest in darkening the door of this diner again.\n\nI rate diners based on how they deliver on four menu items: their hash, biscuits and gravy, country fried steak, and pancakes. I wasn't able to try Merry-Ann's hotcakes or their steak, so I'm just rating my experience on the hash and biscuits and gravy.\n\nMerry-Ann's is a cute, Illini-paraphanalia-ed (is that a word?) diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice. The booths are teeny and sticky, with an assortment of dairy-free creamer and jam stacked haphazardly on one end. Interesting. But ick. Their $3 orange juice is pulp-less, watered down concentrate.\n\nTheir hash is AMAZING. It's the reason why I'm giving Merry-Ann's its single star. Crispy yet soft, I could've had platters of this thing. Dripping in ketchup or on its own or mixed with the diner's pepper gravy, oooh the hash is heaven.\n\nBiscuits and gravy. Oh gosh. What went wrong? I appreciate the full-size serving, but the biscuits were soggy and the gravy.... I am a fan of sausage gravy in general (I don't discriminate), and I have no qualms of venturing out into the pepper gravy arena, but gravy in general should be thick and flavorful and not congeal and as awesome as it could be. Merry-Ann's does not know how to make a good gravy. It was flavorless and milky and the only reason I even ate it was because I mixed it with the aforementioned fabulous hash browns.\n\nSigh. Oh well. Am still on the search for a great breakfast nook in Champaign. Any suggestions? <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Staff was very young and lacked a sense of professionalism on any level and it was obvious there is a lack of leadership.  \nWas a busy evening, the wait was reasonable though at about 15 minutes for three of us.\nShortly after being seated a young guest at another booth got sick on the floor.  Our server, who was taking our order, immediately made a big dramatic scene about how she couldn't see stuff like that and ran off to the back.\nWe then watched no less than 10 staff (not an exaggeration) walk by/over/around the prominent mess with no effort given to cleaning it up or acknowledgement to the guests around it.  Finally a young man with a mop bucket full of dirty kitchen water showed up to mop up the mess...  No thought given to the fact that it's a biohazard in a restaurant and obviously having no training in how to handle the situation.\nHe then parked the mop bucket in the dining room next to us (splashing the disgusting mix onto the wall) while having a loud conversation with another staff member about it.  He came back a few minutes later with a bucket of pungent bleach water and towel to hand wipe the floor and, using the same cloth, the seats and table top.  \nOur server did eventually come back and let us know that she did put our order in.  Another server then stopped by to tell us how it reminded her of a scene in a movie where a bunch of kids puked after trying tobacco chew... I really can't make this up.  It was an experience that I will never forget.\nThe food?  My burger was average, but not bad and my wife's clam strips were inoffensive but rather flavorless.  Our daughters spaghetti was predictably bland.\nI will be in no hurry to go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was a little wary of being in an airport hotel, especially one so close to the runways...but you could barely hear anything. The rooms were very nice, comfy bed and a little kitchen. You might want to make sure you aren't near the ice machine, they are a bit loud in the rooms next to them. The pool was pretty nice, warm and clean.\nCheck in and out was a breeze. I got a cookie upon check in which was very nice. The restaurant was decent and has a bunch of free computers outside of it for hotel guests to use.  There is Wi-Fi but you have to get the code from the front desk to log on.  The free shuttle to the airport is awesome and very quick. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I have to say, after going to several bridal shops, this David's Bridal was the absolute worst. This was the first place I went to try on dresses. I went with my mom on a Wednesday afternoon a couple months ago. The store was totally empty except for us and I had an appointment. The girl who was helping us pulled out some of the dresses I had marked online. She also gave me a special bra for the fitting...but she gave me the wrong size and did not tell me it was the wrong size (I thought I was shrinking!) because they didn't have my size. Really? It is a VERY common size. So, that alone made the dresses look weird. So I tried on a couple dresses, but wasn't really feeling them. I asked the girl (Meghan, I think) if she knew of any nontraditional or funky dresses I could try on and she brought out a few things, but they just were not my style. She didn't spend the time talking to me or looking at my picks from the internet to know what I wanted. Throughout this process, the sales lady would disappear for periods of time (don't know to where considering the store was empty) and I would have to sit around waiting. Then, I asked if I could try on a Vera Wang dress, and she informed me that they only had it in a size 4 (I'm a bridal size 8). I asked her if I could just slip it on open to get an idea of what it would look like. She refused. She held it up to me on the hanger, but would not let me set foot in it. Ridiculous! This sure as hell is not the way to sell dresses. After that move, I was done. I was totally insulted and didn't find anything special anyway, so I moved on. I would not recommend this to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  My advice - come here for the beer if you're in the University area, but skip the food.\n\nFlying Saucer does have an amazing selection of beer, especially great beers on tap I'm not sure how many they have, but it's more than 30).  On certain days, you can pay $3-4 and get some sort of mystery beer.  What can I say - I love the mystery of it!  I got a Mexican Logger and thought it was pretty good.\n\nTheir menu has pretty standard bar-fare, with sandwiches, wings, and pizza.  Their pretzels were decent, but I had a River Rocket sandwich and was thoroughly unimpressed.  For the portion sizes and quality, their food is seriously overpriced.  One Sunday, my partner and I came in while he got an oil change.  It was probably a little before noon, and we came here because we thought breakfast places would be busy.  We intended to just get lunch, but lo and behold, we say people with plates and breakfast food on them.  Not knowing anything about it and asked the waitress, who did not tell us much except that apparently it is $11 if you are not a member.  It turns out this was a TERRIBLE idea.  So, I asked if they had coffee, which they did - SERVED IN A REGULAR BEER GLASS.  It was a very weird situation for us.  All the food on it was cold, it had only eggs, sausage, potatoes, and some muffins.  First off, it was GROSS.  Second, there was barely anything left on it and they were not refilling it (when we left, it was all gone).  It would have been nice for our waitress to tell us this before we ordered, but she looked like she could not be bothered.  I probably would have complained, but we decided instead to pay and leave.  It was a lesson learned to check the buffet before just blindly ordering.  Another family came in afterward for the buffet, which turns out had no food on it by that time.  I can't believe the waitress did not warn us of this before we ordered.\n\nBecause of this last experience, I don't think I'll ever go back.  I have no doubt Sunday afternoon is just a bad time to come, but this visit just completely soured me on the place.  They really have nothing here I can't get somewhere I like better. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Fast, Friendly,  and Good Food. Stopped after a long day on the road. Parking lot had a crowd so I try it. If you order the Gyro dinner you better be hungry.  Definitely get your money's worth. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, jackets, pants, and dresses etc.to be cleaned.  This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend $30 for $50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.  Cheers!  \n\nOne request for the owner: please put a fan (or anything to cool) in the receiving area.  That place can get toasty for those that choose to pick up in person. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great rooms, great rates. I've stayed in Middleton before but this location can't be beat. They have a shuttle that will even take u to the convenience store. Spacious, clean, an very friendly staff. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I went to Sabroso Fresh Mexican Grill with my son for dinner and it wasn't a good experience. Definitely not kid friendly...the options for the kids meals were not healthy at all or fresh for that matter. The woman taking my order seemed rude and inpatient and she ended up getting my order wrong. The restaurant was a mess the tables were dirty and a lot of trash on the floor. The food was the worst Mexican food I've ever had, I ordered the barbacoa tacos and the meat was cold it wasn't even warm. This place was anything but sabroso. Which in spanish means delicious...if they had less than a star I would give them just that. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Horrible customer service.  Asked for help and was told to go wait in a line. next, That girl couldn't find the item that was kept behind counter. Didn't want to spend time on me because of people behind me. Other customer asked if she could call for backup.  Manager standing around said in a minute.  Continued doing nothing. I won't return to this location. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  To hell with this airport and really, to hell with Arizona.\n\nThat hurts me to say, I met my wife while we both lived and worked at Grand Canyon, and I've spent a lot of time in mostly northern Arizona.  At one time I dreamed of retiring to a small ranch with lots of big dogs and Mount Humphreys looming in the distance.  No more, those days are long behind me.\n\nThe combination of my disgust with Phoenix - really just a hotter, dryer version of LA -  and the unseemly politics of people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Brewer have  pretty much taken me to the point where I don't plan to set foot (or spend another dollar) in that state.\n\nThis airport blows.  It's huge, if you rented a car it succeeds in outdistancing even Providence in terms of how far you must travel to get your vehicle.  Plan on an extra half hour to take shuttle buses and then hunt for your car due to the extreme lack of effective signage and staff.\n\nAnd please tell me why the hell I'm paying for your football stadium.  Your team sucks, you have a (ridiculous) corporate sponsor for it,  so why are people who could not care less about the Arizona Cardinals paying a stadium surcharge?\n\nI'll continue to vote with my dollars, and none of them will be heading to Arizona.  As someone who flies a lot, all over the world, Sky Harbor is on my personal shit(hole) list. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The store is kind of small, and there's not a whole lot to choose from.  They have new and used books, all separated into their various sections.  But the whole wall of romance novels kind of ruined it for me.  In fact there were so many romance novels they had to separate them into sections (historical and modern).  Now I have nothing against romance novels, they just aren't my thing.  If you are into them then certainly go check this place out, but having almost half a store dedicated to them was a little much for me. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This may be the first time I've gotten out of a place with a French tip pedicure for $25!  \n\nThe place by my house that I normally go was undergoing a remodel so I decided to check this place out with a friend.   It was really busy on a Sunday.  Pedicure was $21 (+4 for anything fancy like French tips).   We thought it would be a rushed pedicure because they were so busy but they took their time on us, prepped our little piggies, scrubbed our feet good and painted perfectly.   \n\nDownsides:  Only take cash for tips (you couldn't add it to the credit card when you pay) so we had to run to an ATM and back.   Also, I had a lot of little gnats flying around my chair, my friend didn't seem to notice any by her chair- I was the closest to the door.  So it lost a cleanliness point for me.    (all the tools/staff seemed to be sanitary)\n\nOverall, nothing too special about this place other than it was a good price.. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible!\nI've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.\n\nI know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and rating <|endoftext|>

As Elton John belted out so many times, You're Like A Candle In The Wind. And as the Doors famously sang Come On Baby Light My Fire! \n\nWe all know it's about the accessories right. And Mike, girl, you sure know how to decorate. Thank you for prettying up our restaurant with your votives, vases and va va voom! Your votives provide just the perfect lighting for our guests. Kinda like the soft back lighting Barbra Streisand demands in any film she makes. \n\nAnd a visit to your showroom....was like...nirvana baby! I totally wanted to play house like I would do at furniture stores when I was a kid. Ok a teenager. Ok Ok...like I did last week at Crate & Barrel. Sheez! \n\nAnd yes. If you want to introduce Kathy Griffin to me, I suppose it's ok. Obviously her career could use a boost and I think it's important to help those out that are less fortunate! \n\nKisses, \nThomas <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I came here once and ordered pho, and I was very disappointed. Bland broth, tough meat, I didn't get the Tram's hype. Not that I've ever tried mind-blowing pho (I've only eaten it in Pennsylvania, which is probably the problem) but this was even worse than most.\n\nHowever, I've since been back and ordered the bun. Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.\n\nI do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality.\n\nRegardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We never had Red Devil pizza because we thought they didn't deliver, but THEY DO! So we tried them today.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I won an air conditioner and a heating tune-up through an auction. Upon the initial inspection I was told that everything should be OK but that a newer furnace (mine is 8 years old) was recommended. \n\nLater, when it was determined I could not afford a new furnace I was told that my venting was not up to code. All Comfort Services would then be happy to sell me a new furnace (to replace one that's only 8 years old) and a new water heater as well as the stuff that goes along with it (plumbing, electrical, etc.) \n\nSo I took it upon myself to hire a home inspector to look things over and was told that everything was fine. The venting was indeed up to code and that there should be no real reason that I couldn't have the A/C and venting work I wanted done with the current set-up. The inspector then also told me he has had trouble with All Comfort Services in the past using similar bait-and-switch tactics to upsell customers into equipment that is not needed (in my case it was to make up for the A/C unit I was getting for much less than the list price I think). \n\nEmails and phone calls to Kendall Richards, the owner, went unanswered when I tried in vain to get my money refunded to me. Thankfully my credit card company worked with me to dispute the charges and I got my money back. \n\nI would stay far, far away from All Comfort Services and instead use a more reputable heating and air conditioning vendor. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Surreal experience at the Ritz this week. My friend is a guest there for the week. We were having breakfast and a server recognized my friend from past visits. I was introduced by first name only to the server. This afternoon I get a \""no caller ID\"" call on my cell and its this server asking me out. I was stunned to say the least. This is supposed to be highly inappropriate for their employees to do. The only way she could have gotten my contact info is to have looked up my friend in their database and seen that I am listed as their contact. My friend met with the hotel management today and they were more accusatory than helpful. We had Thanksgiving brunch scheduled but that is cancelled since the server is working it.and my friend is checking out early. The mgmt told my friend they would contact me and they haven't.\n\nThank you Ritz-C for allowing one of your employees to be a stalker and not giving a shit.\n\nDo yourself a favor folks and stay elsewhere. Like the Biltmore Hotel, Royal Palms, or the Phoenician. They are very close and certainly care more about their guests and reputation than this glorified Motel 6. <|endoftext|>

No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:\n\nShe walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! \""Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?\"" I asked. She looked back and asked where. \""There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim.\"" \""Yes\"". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. \""No,\"" she replied. \""My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me.\"" She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back <|endoftext|>

Unlike my usual stops (Chicago, Washington, Newark), I have never had an issue in Charlotte. \n\nIt's small enough that it is simple to navigate in a short period of time. There are moving sidewalks (although they frown upon using them with a stroller) and some nice food options - both fast food and sit-down meals. Flights move in and out quickly without a huge domino effect with delays. I think I like Charlotte's airport, actually.\n\nSince I've only been here for connections, I can't comment on the check in area or the security checkpoint. Everything I've seen thus far, I like!\n\nOh, and the restrooms have a bathroom attendant. This means they are quite clean (for an airport restroom, anyway) and they have mouthwash and other goodies. Traveling with a small child? There are family restrooms available as well. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not a great experience last night at Eastwind. I'm going to start this by saying that I've been eating here for over 20 years, when it was Tokyo Express and now Eastwind. I was a customer weekly when I lived closer, now it's every 60 days or so.\n\nWe went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  \n\nSo we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink. Guess that's supposed to make up for it.... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> What a great shop! As crazy as it sounds, I've never been in here! For a cooking nut like me, that's just bonkers. They have every single awesome cooking toy you could ever want and WAAY more. They also have tons of sauces, rubs, seasonings etc to play around with. The only draw back is it's VERY pricey, although it's all super quality stuff. They DO have classes every Sunday at 11. The wife and I are going to attend a pasta making class this Sunday! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  BlackFinn is like Buckhead Lite, if that makes sense. This place is literally like stepping into a good ol' boy frat house, maybe at Clemson or UNC. But as I've previously stated, this doesn't mean that the place isn't fun. It just means that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you head over there. Not a place to go for a casual drink, unless you're going midday or on a quieter night early in the week. \n\nLots of TVs in this huge bar, so it's a pretty decent place to watch a football or basketball game, especially since a lot of fans turn out here to check out their team. Located literally across the street from the Arena, it gets pretty packed before or after Bobcats games/concerts. It gets especially nuts on Friday and Saturdays, so be warned (or advised, if that's what you're looking to get into). \n\nThere's always a cover, which is a pain in the butt, but it's generally a good time if you're looking to really tie one on with friends. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Please make 0 stars an option Yelp!  Avoid BOB and STEVE at the Thomas/44th St. location at all costs! Got suckered into a Serta Perfect Sleeper here, and within a MONTH the nearly $1500.00 bed was sagging!  We didn't want to deal with it and are moving and called Bedmart about the warranty weeks ago.  They looked up our file, and said that an inspector would \""be in touch\"" to set up an appointment to inspect the bed.  I waited a week and called back but they said not to worry.  I called a week later, and they said they would \""look into it.\""  Called again and they said they'd look into it again, but go no return call.  Finally, I called again today, for the 4th time, and STEVE told me there was no way it would happen until next year (after we move).  \n\nThat's annoying, and bad service, sure, but the reason I'm writing this is that they were patronizing, rude, and just plain insulting.  When I said I was dissatisfied at having to wait a month, after we move, just for the initial appointment, STEVE spoke to me like he was doing me a favor to look into why we had not been contacted!  In fact, he actually said this!  He was vague about the whole thing and when I asked a question about it, he actually said he could fax my request to the \""factory today\"" or \""THROW IT IN THE TRASH!\""  \n\nBTW, the \""manager\"" Bob said the factory is actually closed, so faxing it was not a favor at all!  Either way, are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell?  No!  \n\nI called back and asked to speak to the store manager, who answered the phone and identified himself as BOB.  Without even giving me a chance to say hello, he gruffly said he had heard the whole conversation and was not going to allow abuse.  I explained that I was the abused one, and that unless I had been on speaker phone, he had only heard one side of the conversation.  He did not like facts, and was even more rude after I pointed this out.  Needless to say, he clearly did not care about customer service, talked over me and cut me off, and spoke to me like he was Donald Trump and I was his peon contestant.  He proceeded to tell me that there would be no inspection anytime soon, since the Serta factory was closed until the New Year. \n\nBut he offered a hollow favor...if I wanted, he would call me Monday, Xmas Eve.  Umm, hello, but you just told me the factory who sets up the inspection appointments, is closed for 10 days...so what new information would you have in 2 days?  BOB did not want to be bothered with facts, and just wanted to shove it to me, whether it made sense or not, so he kept repeating and belaboring this.  \n\n\""When does the factory open, I asked?\""  But BOB, who either made up the whole thing about the closure, or knew only half the facts, or just wanted to keep shoving it to me, wouldn't tell me.  \""When do you want me to call you back, since you want everything on your schedule,\"" he asked.  \""How about right when the factory re-opens.\""  \""How about we just have them call you to set up the appointment,\"" he said.  Um, but \""I already did that weeks ago, and they didn't set it up,\"" I pointed out.  (That's why I called 4 times.)  \""Whenever the factory opens, the next day would be fine,\"" I said.  Then BOB decided, even though I told him this would not work, he would not follow up on why they hadn't called and just start over.  In other words, throw the follow-up request in the trash!  No, I said, I don't want that.  \""That's what I'm doing,\"" and then hung up on me\n\nWe went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it, we don't hear from them repeatedly.  Someone else at the 44th/Thomas location was supposed to follow up with me two days ago but never did (on my 3rd call).  Clearly, they want to get a bed sold, period.  If you have a problem, which eventually you will, they will tell you it is someone else fault, not return calls, patronizingly tell you that they are doing you a favor to follow up on your lack of service, and basically treat you like you are crap because you have a problem with the bed.  To top it all off, they will hang up on you and be rude.  Stay away from this location, from BedMart generally, and from Bob and Steve! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I like this place.\n\nI found out about Ryan's a couple of years ago and this is my go-to place for when I need certain pet products and want to save some money.  My girlfriend and I have great danes so when we were able to get a massive crate here for way less than other retailers wanted, we jumped on it.  If you have never been here it can be a little weird the first time.  Nothing is really labeled, though they finally put up category signs on the aisles so you at least know roughly where to go.  They have catalogs there that you can look at to find the prices of the products (nothing is labeled on the shelves) and you literally pull things out of bins.  \n\nThat being said, this is a great place to come for dog toys.  You can get a ton of toys on the cheap that are the same quality as other major retailers.  They do not sell food here but you can pick up treats if needed.  They also have a better selection of muzzles than Petsmart and Petco do.  If you haven't been here before, check out their website to get an idea of what they have before you come down.  It is a warehouse so be prepared that it is not air conditioned and can be a little muggy when you go in there.\n\nThe staff is typically friendly whenever I have been here.  I have not utilized the website as far as ordering but I do use it to compare products to other online stores.  If you have pets, I definitely recommend checking this place out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The prices are obscene they cook in nasty old grease we had the fish and shrimp both were awful and not enough a two year old could prepare better food! We were Very disappointed and will not be going back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  So sick of WAITING while tables sit empty & the \""cutsie\"" little greeter girls act like they are working. No idea of organization or time management. Used to love this one but not anymore.  After waiting, kids meals came when we were done eating and they were stone cold!  The one manager is very condescending & could care less.  Could be a major reason this Applebee's is going downhill.  I'll be happy to drive to north Scottsdale or even Elliot. They both have more responsible employees & managers that care. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I try to understand why people can be so rude. But to be rude over and over again is just unacceptable.  You have to be great full you have a job.   My boyfriend and I went to go return something,  thinking it was 24/ 7 customer service environment,  this lady that seemed to have been working the customer service desk, walked by us, gave us a really snotty answer and said it's closed. This was after waiting 30 MINUTES  to get someone to the electronic area. We hand to hunt down workers 2 times. Finally, got some one to help us, and ended up waiting longer after we asked to speak to the manager about the attitude, and the waiting for a worker to assist us. He was very polite, I wish I knew his name because He Deserves to be recognized.  How ever, all the cashiers seem to have the worst days ever. I don't know why? I feel like the customers seem way happier than the employees, and that... that is strange! \n\nAnother day my boyfriend went in to purchase a new razor. This was around 10 pm. The razor was in the lock box. So he asked an associate to help. The associat went to grab some one and no one came.... then, he saw another associat,  asked to get someone with a key, that associat located someone with the keys... and... the lady told him.. I can't find the key, walked away and never came back. He waited 15 minutes thinking someone would be coming back with the appropriate key.\n. NOPE.  Let's just say, our well earned money won't be spent at this location any more. I hope the employees realize that there life can get much more worst, and hope they know they are worth a smile. It would look better on there faces! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place has completely given up. I don't know if they have had new owners within the last 4 months or so but its gotten really bad. Unless your one of the regulars who have probably been drinking since 11am you don't get much attention here.\n\nJust went there tonight for the 35 cent wings on Monday night. Waited 5 minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me. Placed my order right away as I could tell how often I would see her again. Just got 2 dozen wings. ....... 45MINS LATER my wings show up. Not exaggerating at all. NEWSFLASH- Wings take 8mins in the fryer...why would I have to wait 45mins??? When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. \n\nIts sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit. NEVER AGAIN. Thank Jackie for the great experience and hope you can find another dump hole to work in 6 months when this place is closed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> For a cheap ass mexican place, its damned good! Lets face it there are a TON of \""-bertos\"" and \""-icos\"" ending mexican joints with interchangeable prefixes  but the Federicos on 32nd and Shea is truly one of the good ones. The AZ burritos are awesome as well as the quesadillas - try it with their green sauce and you wont be disappointed! Tostadas arent bad either :)(: one thing, steer clear of adding chicken or steak the quesadillas it ruins them, they get extra fatty/greasy! And hey, open 24 hours? Cant beat that with a stick lol <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Theses guys kind of suck. They sold me stuff I didn't need and the lady behind the desk doesn't know anything about the products. \nI needed to return some extra material and there is no way to do it without a receipt. \nIt sucks when it's easier to go to Home Depot. I guess I need to find a new brickyard. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great food in a very homey location. Set up as a cute local family style place, we tested it with my well behaved 3year old grandson. Most of the other diners were our age and enjoyed the young enthusiastic Italian eater. The staff went out of their way to show him a good time. \nAs for the food, excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce. Meatballs were light and tasty, ravioli were homemade ade delicious. I had the veal parm which was great. \nIf you are in town for a meeting, give it a try <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Seriously! I know its a slow day, but there's only one car getting service in 11 service bays, one guy working and the other four technicians are chatting, checking their phones and who knows what.  Pep Boys must be cherry picking the road maintenance crews or is now under postal service management.  \n\nIt's a simple oil change and tire balance, so it shouldn't be difficult to do more than one tire at a time.  You'd think they'd want to get a customer in and out quicker.  \n\nMaybe my first clue was that they were not busy on a Sat morning, when everyone else in town had an hour wait, but now, I can see why this place is empty.  My second clue was the other bad reviews on yelp...  \n\nI would have given one star, but the guys at the front desk were helpful and attentive.  Too bad it ended there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  As a former happy customer of Lollilocks at Desert Ridge (which sadly closed), we decided to come here for my 4 year old daughter's haircut.  I was very unimpressed with the atmosphere, cleanliness, and employees.  \n\nThe older woman that cut my daughter's hair barely talked to her, other than to ask her what video she wanted to watch. I feel that if you're going to cut kid's hair for a living, you should be a person who's good with children.  She then proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes trying to sell me hair products.  I finally just walked away after trying politely in vain to let her know I wasn't interested in buying anything other than the haircut.\n\nThe place seemed like it was in need of a remodel, didn't look particularly clean, and the full court press on the hair products was a complete turn-off.  I won't be taking my kids back, unless I'm desperate. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> 5 stars all the way.

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \""personal\"" pie, costs $7 and is 7\"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \""small,\"" which is 10\"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\"" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\"" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\"" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\""\n\nI ate three out of the six \""slices.\"" (One sixth of a 10\"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me \"" it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants\"". I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen. \nI contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there, very friendly and easy to work with, called back was very impressed. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I'm very surprised at the quantity of low reviews for this place, as I think it has the best sushi in the city and is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Yes, it is pricey but I think it's safe to assume that the quality and freshness of fish here is a little bit higher than the stuff you see at your local Giant  Eagle.  \n\nI definitely suggest trying the Wasabi Tobiko ($4 per piece).  Such a unique piece of sushi, and one of the reasons I've been counting down the days until my next visit to Umi. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Always understaffed.  I can't tell you how many times I've been there and they have one poor server working on half the tables! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Best deal on a full set of tires, and some of the most professional and quality service in the valley. Came highly recommended from a friend, glad we listened! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Was visiting Phoenix for four days.  Ate breakfast at this Good Egg twice.  Had Huevos with Chorizo the first day, and their Crunchy Apple Crepes the second.   Enjoyed both.   Wish we had someplace this good back in the Twin Cities. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been to this place a couple of times once for dinner and a couple of times for happy hour. And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.\n\nThe food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better\n\nThe best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place. \n\nAnother good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two. \n\nI would highly recommend this place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stopped in with a friend on a Sunday night while walking around the area and watching the ice skating. It wasn't crowded and our server showed up immediately. I ordered the colossal mushroom burger with onion rings. That thing was HUGE. I cut it in half and managed to stuff my face. It was delicious, but way more meat than this tummy can hold. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great for breakfast. Good biscuits and link sausages. Also I have not been disappointment with fish dishes, chicken. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Beautiful hotel, lovely sunny room decor. Very comfy beds. Super clean! Nice amenities. Close to everything. Staff helpful. No free wifi, come on! Quiet. Great view from our high room. Great deal for my Johnson & Wales student. Loved our stay here! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  What a disappointment! This restaurant is seriously over-rated. We recently took some out-of-town guests here for dinner and was very embarrassed. The fish was below average quality and the preparation well-presented but not as described,had no seasoning at all, and small portions.\n\nThe wait person was on top of things and the food was served very quickly - but then again, on a Saturday night we were one of 15 tables in the whole place. \n\nOver-priced, nothing to write home about - will not return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Decent selection, fair prices, but could use more folks at the checkout lanes, or at least a process whereby they call up more employees to help out quicker. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I will never order flowers through Cactus Flowers again.  I ordered flowers online to be delivered on Saturday 2/11 for a friend's mom for her birthday.  They delivered without the personalized card.  My order confirmation clearly shows the message I had written for her.  She had to call Cactus Flowers twice to figure out who they were from and the employee she spoke to was incredibly rude to her.   Also the flowers did not look like what I had ordered.  In the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely.  I called Cactus Flowers the next day, Sunday to try and figure out what happened.  Even though I had my order number, it still took her 10 minutes to find my order.  Apparently the flowers had come out of their Carefree location so if I wanted them to deliver a new bouquet, she would call that location to make sure they had all the flowers that were supposed to be in it.  She said she would call me back and let me know.  I had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail.  It took me until THursday to get back in touch with them due to my work schedule and the fact that....wait for it.....they have no voicemail.  What kind of business operates with no way for anyone to leave them a message?\n\nSo on Thursday I finally reached them and spoke to someone else and she told me that they would redeliver Friday or Saturday.  Guess what, it didn't happen!  I called back yesterday and spoke to someone who was less than pleasant and she said she would have a manager call me back today.  It is now 3:00 and I haven't heard from anyone.  I'm sure I will have to call them back, again.  I don't think I have ever experienced such crappy customer service.  It actually takes effort to suck as much as they do.  \n\nMoral of this story:  Do not use Cactus Flowers.  I will return to using Pro Flowers as I have never had any issues with them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Love it except its such a cluster inside-between all the store items for sale and people waiting for there orders and employees squeezing by to work.\n\nHad the commuter  which was a homeade english muff with mayo, egg tomato and your choice of meat or avocado.  Soooo good!\n\nThe menu has such a variety-pizza, sushi, breakfast, lunch.  Saw some hot pressed tuna sandwiches that looked amazing as well.  \n\nI wish I could come here more often but its a little out of the way.  Also, I'd be 50 pounds heavier lol. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place gets a 4 star based on the decor itself. There is nothing like a classic ice cream parlor setting to take you back and provide its own unique experience. The ice cream is nothing special but its the booths and the menus and the pretty decor that really got me. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Will NEVER take our dog here again. Our dog spent two nights here and I can't believe the damage that was done in that time. Upon pick up we asked how she had done, and were told, \""She's on Facebook!\"" (which she wasn't...) but weren't given any legitimate information. What actually had happened was that ALL of her gums were bruised and her teeth were covered with metal from chewing on a cage for 2 days straight. The next week at home she cried in pain when she played with any chew toys. She had lost a noticeable amount of weight (in 2 DAYS) so who knows if she was fed. He nose was swollen and there was a quarter sized wound on the top of her nose. When we asked the staff who walked her out to us what happened he had no idea. \n\nHaving our fun-loving happy dog be visibly terrified walking out to us and not even looking up to see who we were until she could smell us upset me us so much. If you love or care about your dog spend the extra 5 dollars for a place that cares about animals. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I was pretty excited to try Soba Lounge for the first time - as a fan of the Big Burrito Group, I couldn't pass on the opportunity. As soon as we entered we were asked if we wanted to sit at a table on the right, or at the bar. If want a lounge experience, I highly suggest going to the bar which has couches as well as bar seats (better for groups), if you want an intimate conversation (2-4 people), I suggest being seated to the right.\n\nFood: We ordered the crispy tofu and mushroom & spinach dumplings for appetizers, the grilled salmon and spicy basil noodles for entrees, and shared the chocolate maki for dessert.\n\nCrispy Tofu: Must eat for vegetarians or meat eaters. Cooked perfectly, with a tangy sauce\n\nMushroom & spinach dumplings: a little smaller than expected, but the red pepper dipping sauce did it in for us. The combination of flavors was great.\n\nSpicy basil noodles: Seems pretty conventional to order here, but the waitress said that it was a \""signature dish.\"" Pretty standard if you ask me, but nothing to complain about.\n\nChocolate Maki: We were excited for this, but unfortunately a tad disappointed. The pistachio cream and nuts were a great touch for the mousse, but the pistachio crepe had an awkward, rubbery taste to it.\n\nDrinks: The management and staff have differing opinions on weather or not you can bring a drink (from the bar) to your table. To clarify: YOU CAN. Go ahead and order a drink at the bar (very good cocktails/martinis) and walk over to your table. If you're a gin drinker, I highly recommend the Bee Keeper (my favorite) and Gin Blossom. The bartenders aren't shy with alcohol, so keep that in mind.\n\nAtmosphere & Service: The waitress was super helpful, and the atmosphere provided a good medium for a great conversation. Overall, great restaurant, but a little on the pricier side. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is just sad. Half the stores are closed, and the other half are under rennovations. I walked away, as I was at the convention center, willing to spend a few shekles... and left annoyed at the state this center is in. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I wasn't so sure about going to this place, but turns out that it was well worth the drive. \n\nWhen I went the place was packed. Despite the sheer amount of people, there was room for parking and the service was still pretty fast. The dining room is rather small, but they manage to fit quite a few people in there. The decor is nice and subtle. \n\nEven though it was busy, the hot tea came out hot, as did our food. They gave us a basket of rolls to eat while we waited which were warm and soft. I had the Hakata Ramen. It was awesome. There is enough in the bowl to make two meals of it. If you prefer large amounts of meat in your ramen, I recommend getting the 'extra pork' version, as the Hakata only has a few slices in it. The broth was flavorful and the noodles were very soft. As I looked around the packed room, I could see other people's plates- and everything looked pretty darned good- I wish I could have eaten more. \n\nI'll definitely be going back. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet. <|endoftext|>

My only complaint with this bar is that if you are female the waitresses tend to take their time serving you! Otherwise I dig the joint! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \""How could you not order this?\"" while we waited for our table.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  \n\nOnce seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)\n\nWe surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. \n\nBut if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.\n\nIf for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. \n\nMake sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I refuse to go to TGI Friday's in Champaign anymore. I've been here around 4 times, and it's just not worth it. For the price, there are lots of other places to get a good meal in the area.\nI'm very forgiving when it comes to service. I know that servers and waitstaff have a demanding job, and I tip well even for mediocre service. However, truly bad service is inexcusable. I came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita. When my drink was brought out, the server spilled the entire drink all over me. This isn't what bothers me. At another restaurant I'd be totally willing to forgive and forget. It happens. Her reaction was what soured the experience. She gave me a half-hearted, insincere apology and brought me out two extra napkins. Mind you, the full drink was all over my lap and running down my leg - not a two-napkin fix. I asked for more napkins, and it took a couple minutes, but she did come back. She offered to make a new drink, but I told her to forget it and bring me an iced tea. She did, and the meal was fine. The food is alright, but nothing spectacular. I had a cheeseburger and fries, and it was pretty good. I liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit. The real shock came at the end of the meal. We had separate checks, and not only was I never offered a discount or compensation for the server's mistake, but she tried to charge me for the margarita! I've had waiters slip up elsewhere, and while I don't think it's necessary to offer a discount, it sure is appreciated, especially when I've spent nearly an hour eating my meal and covered in sticky, cold margarita, through no fault of my own. A manager eventually came over to speak with me about the bill, and he ended up comping our appetizer and my iced tea. Still, the server's poor attitude ruined what could have been a pleasant evening out. I won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After having experienced a business lunch at Capital Grill within the last year, I decided to treat my family (wife and two teenage boys) to a dinner at Capital Grill during Restaurant Week in Charlotte.  I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.  \n\nLet's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.  \n\nThe service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I started bringing my Audi here about 3 years ago. The staff is friendly and forthcoming. Generally speaking, car repairs suck but the mechanics here make the process here easier. Most importantly, I feel like I can trust them. I never feel pressured to get more work done than I can afford and they take the time to explain the repairs to me and answer my questions clearly and respectably. They are just stand up guys. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Not my favorite live music venue in town.  They pull in good local acts weekly, and the drinks are tasty and inexpensive enough, but it's a bit too loud to enjoy the performances without blowing out an eardrum.  Do stop-in to see Moose, though - he's cool. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Really enjoyed this quaint little wine bar. Ambiance and decor were great, however it was dark so difficult to read the menu. The Waitress helped me pick out a good glass of red wine, although she liked more rose wines. The bruschetta was AMAZING!!! We tried a variety of the bruschetta: apple & bri, artichoke and prosciutto. Can't wait to go back! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This airport does not have many amenities, especially in terminal 2.  They have improve what is there but there is mostly just a bunch of wasted space because Alaska Airlines only has 6 or 7 flights per day in and out of here and if you have time to kill, bring a good book or a fully charged laptop so you will have something to occupy yourself with!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> The grounds are very nice here, but I have to say the part I loved best was the collection of cars. I've never seen so many antique vehicles in one place. Definitely makes it worth checking out. However. The location is a bit wacky. It's right outside of Wilkinsburg, which isn't a place to visit at all. But still, it is nice enough to check out. Especially if you want to just go have a nice lunch at the cafe. <|endoftext|>

The students have even opened for the Phoenix Suns! They are very involved in showing off their students at shows all around town.\n\nThe experienced teachers make every student feel special and build special bonds with all their students and family members. Even the teachers of the adult classes encourage you every step of the way to push harder. It's a one-of-a-kind place that the whole family will enjoy coming to. Every May, Brick's puts on a HUGE show for family and friends to see their SUPERSTARS shine.\n\nSpecials run for both children and adult classes. While you're acquiring information, watch one of the many classes in action from outside one of the four studios. You'll see how much the teachers love their job and how much the kids enjoy being there. \n\nEven if you just need active wear. Brick's boutique keeps up with all the latest trends. They have all styles, colors, and sizes for both adults and children's. The custom made tutus are the cutest!!! <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Prior to dining there, I was unaware that they are the same company as the Good Egg.   Of course, had I known, I would have driven a stake through my eye rather than dine here.   This is because, as the previous reviewer noted, dining at the good egg is like playing chess with yourself:  The sort of thing you do only in times of absolute desperation.\n\nGiven that, my expectations withered to McDonalds levels once I sat down and figured out about its nefarious affiliation.   However, I was mostly pleasantly surprised, a feat which isn't hard since the bar was set somewhere below sea level.   I had a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  The cheese was a tasty brie and the bread a thick and fluffy sourdough.   The eggs were bland and shitty (read: from a can) but the bacon and cheese made up for it.   \n\nAt 7.50 for the sandwich, it's far from a bargain but it wasn't a complete waste of money.  The service sucked as my server struggled to refill my soda just once.   When she finally did (well after dropping our check) she did at least put it in a to-go cup.  I like the message implicit there--\""get the fuck out,\"" don't you?\n\nSkip this one and go to Denny's at least the suckage won't surprise you there. <|endoftext|>

I do not refer people there strictly due to them. I would not want any of my friends to be treated so poorly. I do take my son just because he is so obsessed with anyting to do with Firefighting. I thought about having his birthday party there, sadly due to the staff changed my mind. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Disgusting, gross, unedible.....I've never been so disgusted by food in my life. Ordered a simple tuna roll, the roll had a really fishy smell and the avocado was hard.

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Another hit or miss Ross, but I've found some great bargains on Michael Kors clothing here.\nI've also gotten designer sunglasses that I would have paid more for! \n\nA great place for women with patience. I often have to try on several things and only leave with a few, but I've found several great basics of finer quality for my wardrobe.\n\nAlso, the dressing room associates are friendly. No one here seems to hate their job, and the store is kept up nicely. The cashiers are quick. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great place to see a show . . .\n\nAside from the spinning stage, which is obviously pretty rad, Celeb Theater makes my favorites list because of the acts it manages to bring to town. For being a relatively small place, they pull their weight and then some. \n\nI am still riding high after seeing Muse here a few months ago. I went with two friends and since the whole venue is open seating we walked in and wandered around looking for seats. This was a struggle, since my friends were 6'6\"" and 6'8\"", respectively, making me the short one at 6'3\"". By a miraculous stroke of luck we ran into some good friends that were saving some space in the 3rd row and they let us slide in. The people behind us weren't all that excited, but we shimmied into the aisle a bit so as to not be such an obstruction. \n\nLong story short: keep abreast of shows at Celebrity Theater. Good acts come around, and you will want to be there to see them first hand at a place like this. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A friend and I came here last month for a car show and had a pretty good time. The place is ginormous! It's also clean, and that's pretty much all I can say about it. We didn't eat there, so I can't comment on the food. The convention center is probably underutilized. I'd like to see a big comics convention come here for instance. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Spinato's originated from Chicago. If I lived in Chicago I would be happy about them moving to AZ. My wife and I shared a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper pizza and did not enjoy it. The pizza was bland, maybe it was missing the fennel seeds in the italian suasage that seems to give the sausage that wonderful flavor. I couldn't quite pinpoint what was missing but I'm guessing I won't be making another visit to Spinato's. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  After reading so many raved reviews of Eliana's, my fat female friend and I decided to give this place a chance.  We went there pretty early, around 4:15pm on a Thursday.  No one was there except us, I hope it's because of the time. My friend commented it must be a front for some South American drug cartel.  Har har.   I ordered the Ensalada (fresh fruit drink) while FFF ordered the Tamarindo ( tamarind citrus drink).  The ensalada is a very sweet drink with thin slices of pear and another fruit I can't seem to tell from the taste.  FFF thought her Tamarindo was sweet at first, then agreed with me it sucked.  It was too sour for my taste buds. \n\n After 2 or 3 minutes, our appetizers came.  My Pupusa ( tortilla stuffed with cheese, pork, refried beans and green bell peppers) came flaming hot.  It was very crispy and tasty, but hardly any traces of pork..  FFF's first reaction to the tamal ( Salvadorian style chicken tamales with vegetables) was a fake cheerful smile.  After 2 more bites, her real opinion surfaced.  Two thumbs down.  I tried it and thought it was ok.  I wouldn't order it, but would eat it if someone offer them to me for free.   Mama Carmen's tamales are still the best.  \nAfter the appetizers, our waitress brought us some soup and what looks like a cole slaw or salad.  It was hard to tell.  We both agreed the cole slaw wasn't good.  I'm not a fan of cole slaw so i can't  really compare it to others.  Our soup was served in a cup the size of a shot glass, the short shot glass.  It was similar to chicken noodle soup.  It was their best dish out of the whole meal.  This shouldn't have been their best dish.  \n\nThe main course finally came and the first thing FFF said was 'the rice is uncle bens'.  I gave her a weird smirk.  Her fish was really small.  They brought out the Filete de Pescado a la Plancha ( fish fillet on the grill)  for her, but she really ordered the Mojarra Frita con Chimo ( fried fish and refried beans).  She was really excited to eat the fish eyes.  The fish was really disappointed,  It was dry and there wasn't any sauce.   I could have cooked better fish.  My Fajitas de Camaron con Pollo o con carne ( fajitas of shrimp and chicken with refried beans. My chicken was dry and the shrimp didn't have any flavor to them.  Applebee's fajitas was definitely better and that's not saying much.  The total bill came out to $32.39 which isn't bad.  We were disappointed with the food.  There wasn't much flavor to the food. The only nice compliment my friend had about the meal was it was a healthy.  Screw that!  If I wanted healthy, I'll go to subway or cypress pita grill.  This is my first review of many to come and it's starting off with a stinker.  Sorry folks. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I have had several meal at the Mansion Club. There is NO membership by the way, well ok its like $10 a year. Jordie Hormel, the owner (recently passed away) needed to do that to annoy the neighbors. Good for him. There are some great stories there.\n\nThe Club has started a \""pay what you think its worth\"" lunch. The menu is quite wonderful, London Broil, A fantastic burger, Caesar Salad and a few other things. The meal is awesome, kudos to the Chef. By the way if you ever want to have a Sunday Brunch that you won't forget, go there on a Sunday. It is pricey BUT you won't find a wider selection of food, and I mean great food, seafood, steaks, soups, appetizers, and don't get me started on desserts.\n\nOk, back to pay what you think. While that part is true, they bring out the bill and you fill in what you want to pay, what they don't tell you is that iced tea is $3 and there is tax and of course tip.So it will still cost you around $10 if you put down $5 or $6.\n\nI had a meet up there with a friend, we both know the place well. Guess I try to keep lunches under $7 these days. Our waitress was wonderful, and the chef did come by the table to say hello. \n\nWe got to sit outside, we requested that. It was nice, but the umbrellas had to be moved a few times to cut off the suns direct rays.\n\nI have no problems with the food, its the best. I wish they were a little more open on beverage costs. They also offered a dessert menu that was extra, and I hate to admit it but I passed. Items were $5 each on there, and the list was pretty impressive for a midweek lunch.\n\nI'll be back but be ready to pay $10 unless you put down $5 or less for the actual meal. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I should give negative stars!! Went in for an oil change and trip check Friday April 25, 2014. I had planned a surprise Disneyland trip for my family and needed everything in tip top shape. Well right before our last mountain pass to San Diego, my check engine light is flashing and you smell something burning. There was a heaven sent heavy machinery auto shop at the top of the mountain that helped us as much as they could. Surprise surprise! My oil plug wasn't put back in properly. My car leaked all the oil. The engine ran so rough it broke my motor mount...now there is oil in the spark plug well. A cylinder went out, and ive went though 8 quarts of oil in 4 days!!! We cant even register an oil reading. Now I'm stuck in Anaheim, CA and I have work tomorrow. Kids have school. Completely ruined this trip!! Shame on you guys!!! This is not the end of this....STAY AWAY!!!!!! These good reviews must be friends of the owner....super shady!!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work, and so I've gone a few times.  Each time, I ask myself, \""Why am I going back?\""\n\nMediocre dish after Mediocre dish, somehow I think it will get better next time.\n\nLast time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?\n\nToday I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.\n\nI was happy with the pizza I had there, but for salads and hoagies? Not so much. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came to Mike N Molly's to see a relative play in his band. I got there late and there was no seating. Across the street a building wall  is painted in chalkboard paint and people are allowed to draw pictures and write whatever they want. I liked that there was no cover charge. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  A charming room, great atmosphere\n\nI have noticed the small bistro on Osborne for many years though never found the opportunity to dine there.  For a recent birthday dinner I was searching for French cuisine and narrowed my search to Sophie's and another well know eatery.  Yelp reviews for both where about equal, the deciding factor for me was the preference for a smaller quiet room, that would be more similar to the small bistros one finds in Europe.  I called for reservations and I was also notified that wine was half off (with 2 entries) on Wednesday. \nUpon arrival the gentleman sitting at the bar came around to ask 'table for two?', no hello or welcome did you have a reservation, no problem but didn't feel terribly welcome.\nOur server stopped to say hello and check on us.  We did start with a bottle of wine, and then asked for two appetizers, the moules and escargot.  We where then advised that the restaurant was out of moules, and the waitress suggested the p\u00e2t\u00e9.   The pate was about bland for our tastes, though the Dijon mustard on the side added a nice flavor, and enjoyed the crisp gherkins. Escargot where fine.   \nWhen ready to order entrees we asked our server which she recommended, the pork or beef Bourgogne, she quickly responded that she recommended the pork, and then also shared that she had never tried the beef.  \nThe pork was well prepared, presented and very tasty, our second entree the house special Duck Cassoulet was perhaps not quite as well prepared.  The duck was cooked nicely, crispy skin, didn't taste as though there was much seasoning, the beans and sausage where nicely done (not overlooked as reported by another reviewer).  \nWe choose not to try a sweet, though I was somewhat surprised that knowing that we were celebrating a birthday, that a small something didn't appear.\nNot surprising that when the check was delivered the wine was not half off as mentioned.  The waitress was quite pleasant about the error, but she did need help and had to find someone that could adjust the bill.  \nWe enjoyed our evening, though will not be in any hurry to return. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's basically a hole in the wall that has live music.  The only problem with this joint is that you can't count on the bands or the guy at the joint that books them.  Without the band you're just stuck in a joint paying too much fit your food.  The regular customers are a good group of people and the staff has been there forever, so yeah, this could be your 'Cheers', but don't expect free refills or decent prices.  Everybody will know your name, though. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I read a few reviews about this place before I went.  Unfortunately I should have followed the negative reviews. The Flank steak was just strips of greasy meat they probably put in the tacos.  The rice was drenched in grease.  It even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me.  I actually gasped.  Let me tell you I LOVE, LOVE mexican food, and I truly got better mexican food off a truck stop (which was amazing, I might add) in Los Angeles.  I mean wow they have great service, a great atmosphere, and I didn't have a margarita (which I love) but the list was extensive.  I bet they are good.   Now, on to the first indication that the food would be bad, the CHIPS! omg out out a bag, just horrible.  The salsas were good.  The contrast of all these good things with very bad ones made me give the place the 2 stars.  I promise you I will not be going back.  Too mad for them because, as I said, I love mexican food!  I could pay a servicer's  tips in a year with the amount of times I've hit Maize and Mas Amigos <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is a  mixed review with the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater because it is housed in Coco's. \n\nI went to Coco's on Friday, August 12 for the Mystery Mansion Bedside Manor dinner the show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We were seated at the table furthest from the stage where most of the show took place. I won't even post any of the pictures I wasted time taking because I was always too far away or behind the actors. Not good! \n\nI paid extra for the salmon. Big mistake. It was way overcooked, hard and tasted like tuna fish. I had two small bites. I asked my friend how a person can burn broccoli and she answered, \""The same way they burn carrots.\"" Burned over-steamed vegetables. Really? The tossed salad in the little cup that kept spilling out as I tried to stab a piece of lettuce with my fork.,and part of the overheated, dry baked potato were the only part of the meal I ate. Bummer. \n\nOver all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid. The jokes were corny and the accents difficult to understand. Pete Swartz (female)made it bareable. She was very good in all of her roles so kudoos to her for make the night bareable. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great store!\n\nOne of the previous reviewers seems to have had some bad experiences with service in the store; my experience thankfully hasn't been the same. I've always had helpful, friendly people working whenever I've popped in to get something for our kitchen.\n\nGreat selection of items, and the staff always have great recommendations for me when I'm not quite sure of what I need. Their sales could be a bit better, but that's not necessarily the store's fault, and it's never really worth the longer trip to the South Side to hit their main competitor's store.\n\nParking can be a bit annoying if you try to get a spot on the street, but the garage around the corner is convenient and is reasonably priced. Gotta love Walnut Street! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Excellent venue. One of the best in Charlotte. It is old. You feel history. It is intimate. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars- it is inconsistent with their band bookings. Sometimes it is really good and other times it is \""meh\"". They definitely don't seem to pick up on traveling indy bands (they seem to go to other venues in Charlotte instead) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I came here for dinner a few weeks ago after reading the reviews on yelp.  I was pretty disappointed and won't be going back.\n\nI got a cup of the wonton soup as an appetizer - it was pretty pathetic.  The wontons had a dime-sized amount of meat in each one, and the broth was awful.  I got sesame chicken and wasn't impressed with that either.  \n\nTo top it off, the family that owns the place let their small child run around the entire restaurant and in and out of the kitchen screaming, with the teenaged hostess (also a family member) hardly bothering to try to quiet her down.  The waitress just went and sat at a table next to the kitchen staring at me the whole time.  What the heck?  Atmosphere gets a zero. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I myself can't recommend Ribeye for a meal, and gave it a low rating, roughly 1 1/2 stars. Because Ribeye has many happy customers, as well as fellow Yelpers who are fans, and who are marking Ribeye higher, I will try to describe Ribeye as well as I can as I relate my single dining experience. That way, you, the reader, will know what to expect if and when you go.\n\nAmbience and Decor:\nLet me first describe the restaurant's ambience. The restaurant is a dark, windowless interior space. The decor is simple, something like wood or wood-like tables and chairs along with booths. When I was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. TV's were visible from most seats of our table, so watching a TV show or event while eating is part of Ribeye's draw. I imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example. There is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area. \n\n\nFood:\nThe food at Ribeye is not to my taste. \n\nThe ribeye steak is low quality meat. Eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience. Perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer. Ribs are on the menu but I just know that the barbecue sauce would not be better, and might be worse, than that offered by McDonalds.\n\nThe salad bar comes with most dinners. The salad bar has a mediocre selection of items, and the quality of each item is basic. Coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli. Freshness of the salad bar is variable by item, depending upon how it turns over. Overall, the salad bar is not worth ordering. It just is not very good.\n\nBread is a hot, fresh loaf, but mediocre nonetheless. Also, Ribeye does something to its butter. The butter is whipped up for sure, but they might add sugar or something to it. \n\nThe vegetables, and items like baked potato or mashed potatoes are edible, but mediocre. These don't appear to be prepared to order. Unfortunately, potatoes and vegetables lose much of their appeal if they are not eaten when freshly cooked to order.\n\nI can't comment on dessert. None of us ordered dessert, and I don't remember what was on the dessert menu.\n\n\nSummary:\nOverall, Ribeye leaves me with the impression of being an upgraded (albeit, a much upgraded) version of Sizzler. It also has the feel of a sports bar. Prices are pretty much in line with what Ribeye offers. That is, prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values. Service is adequate but unremarkable either way.\n\nFor me, this all is about 1 1/2 stars on Yelp. Ribeye is targeted to, and evidently, successfully fills, its own niche in the market. The other reviewers have different opinions, but all of us are evaluating the product that I have tried to describe to you above, in my review. I hope this will give you some idea of what to expect if you visit Ribeye. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.\n\nGourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.\n\nIt's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> bought a camera and a lens here a few weeks ago and i am nothing more than 100% pleased with everything about this place. Judith is amazing and so knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Morgan is very helpful and knowledgeable as well....both have been a great help to me in the process of getting my new camera.\nthey have a wide selection of camera bags and accessories, filters, tripods etc...everything really that may need is there. They dont have a whole lot of cameras but they do have lenses you can choose from new and used :-) \nif youre in scottsdale or looking for a great photo store....DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  cons      OVER PRICED!!!!!\npros       EMPLOYEES KNOW THIER STUFF\npros       6 MONTH LAY-A-WAY (for the over priced merchandise)\n\nFor me.... just because the employess are \""knowledgeable\"" doesn't mean I have to pay an extra 75-100 bucks. \n\nThis is one of the only places in Charlotte that I would feel comfy (and HAVE purchased a gun or 2 from here) coming to. \n\nI would come here to gain knowledge of a certain gun, then go somewhere else to purchase. Unless I use my sisters Military Discount.. (Which would still leave me paying too much)\n\nSIDE NOTE..... Guns don't kill ppl..... ppl w/ guns kill ppl. I have yet to find the scientifc study to a room filled with guns.. Which Gun would fire off (randomly w/o someone pulling a trigger).   Guess I'll keep checking FOX news... \n\nCheers <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be. <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place is a vegetarian mecca and a lot of the soy meat is gluten free which is a huge perk for people like me. The atmosphere could use some work but the food is good and it is priced well. They have fresh juices and a very healthy vibe. The service is always good and it is never super packed. If you have veggie friends that haven't discovered this place it is a gem. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We went to Phoenix Zoo on Wednesday 08/28/13.  It was very disappointing even those we got to the zoo at 8am, there are no animals to see, it is so hot they hide in their house.  After working for like an hour, I was thinking it what a waste of money & I was pissed & thinking I want my money BACK! Hey 4 tickets is a lot to paid & nothing to see. It is so hot in a 3 digits degree. There are some places you have to pay additional money for the rides.  Finally, we come to the money village. This house 15 cute Squirrel Monkeys & the cool part is you get to go inside the cage to get close to them. Off course, you can't touch them & there are many zoo keeper there to keep the monkeys from attacking you & from you touching the monkeys. Another place in the zoo which makes our money worth is the stingrays feeding. Off course, you have to pay additional money to go in & buy the food (fish & shrimps) to feed the stingrays.  There are 31 stingrays in the tank.  FYI, if you gonna let you kids feed the stingrays, you have to be there at noon, lunch time.  Also you must bring a change of clothes for your kid to change afterward, because the smell from the stingray's food (frozen fishes & shrimps) smell HORRIBLE.  We been to bigger & better zoo with much animals & many other activities to for kids to do. However, feeding the stingrays & be in the cage with the monkeys are the 2 things other zoo don't have. At least these 2 activities make my money worth because my niece & nephew loved it.  Will not return, one time is enough. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> We called for delivery at around 6:45 or so, and were told it would be between 30-45 minutes; it took a little longer, but there was a good reason!  When our delivery man arrived at the door breathless, he told me his car had broken down a few blocks over where he was making one delivery, but rather than make us wait, he WALKED all the way with our food to make sure we got it!  Tremendous service! \n\nThe food was delicious, and worth the wait -- plus, SUPER generous portions.  We got Chicken w/Veg and Orange Chicken, and there's enough left of both for at least one, if not two more meals.  The crab puffs were excellent, as well.\n\nIt's nice to have a good, reliable Chinese delivery in the center of town! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> So far I like it. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  If I could give zero stars I would.  Waited almost a half hour for my number to be called to even be registered, but that never happened.  I ended up leaving and going to cvs clinic instead.  Won't ever go back there. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  How incredibly pathetic.  I just had the worst experience at Red.  Then I get on Yelp and realize how many others have come to the same conclusion--enough to write about it!  How can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly.  Wow.  I was seriously shocked--zero personality and 100% icy and rude--as if they didn't even want you in the store.  So why did they open one?  Even if I found the perfect piece, I would never buy from RED MODERN FURNITURE.  People buy from people.  It is about time the owner figured that out. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I'm over it. \n\nToo many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. \n\nThe beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.\n\n(The Monroeville location is better, imo.) <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> This place rocked. We were a little hesitant at first to try it bit it worked out. The location is right smack dab in the middle of a residential area and the diner literally sticks out of a house or possibly used to be a house but the food was phenomenal. All the seating is outdoor with a walk up window to order. The staff and the food choices definitely had a little hipster vibe. The collard greens were freaking amazing and the rest of the food was up to par for sure. Only complaint probably is that the drinks were a bit on the pricy side, $3.50 for a tall can of Pabsts. All in all, I would definitely visit again and again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I make the drive from Scottsdale to the biltmore just for this place. I've been loyal to them -- as they came in on a Friday night before I was leaving the country when I had a tooth emergency! Front office manager (Mary) is uber nice!!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Looks nice but you will pay for it. Way to expensive for what you get. No worries many options to choose from near by. They scream about being local but they really dont partner with local businesses. Save a bunch by just crossing the parking lot or even the street. Just look both ways first. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This isn't a fabulous downtown development BY ANY MEANS, but I did enjoy walking to the movie theater when I lived down the street at Camden Copper Square. AMC's theater is normally uncrowded, has friendly staff, big screens and comfortable stadium seating.\n\nI will also, be honest, I think the \""garden\"" aspect of the development facing Van Buren ST is pretty lovely - especially at night. It is a lush oasis that feels cool, moist and calming amidst the urban heat island h.e.double hockey sticks of surrounding blocks.\n\nThis isn't the best that the downtown Phoenix offers, but it's also not the worst. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Tonight ... this place was HORRIBLE !!!  \nHad 3 different wait staff ... \nWe had not been sitting not 5 minutes when we were basically forced to order ... \nOrdered an appatizer ... salad and cheese bread ... the salad came out promply ... however the cheese bread did not come until AFTER the main dishes came ... and it was FREEZING cold ... could not even eat it ...\nSpeaking of cold ... the main dishes were cold as well when they came out ...\nWhen something was said and the manager came over ... she made some excuse that her pasta maker tonight \""was working extremely fast\"" ... and thats why we got the cold pasta before the cold bread ... \nShe then offered us a free cookie due to it ... but why take it ? So it could come out hard as a rock with melted ice cream ... and still was charged for the bread and cold pasta ... \nIt will be an EXTREMELY long time before we ever visit here again ... \nVERY DISAPPOINTING !!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The only reason I would give this place a 1 star rating is due to their amazing soda and float selection. The food was absolutely disgusting. I never complain about food and I've definitely never sent food back, until tonight. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and was shocked to see that fries aren't even offered as a side. I took one bite of the burger and found bone fragments in the frozen beef. My sister also sent back her bean/veggie burger. It looked equally disgusting. It will take a lot of convincing to get me to go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  How to put this gently?\n\nWhile I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. \n\nIt's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. \n\nIt comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower \""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews\"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...\""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs\"".\n\nOn top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).\n\nIn sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read). <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pretty nice airport.  We were only there for 2 short layovers, but we did have the opportunity to try Bojangles chicken (late night....flight delayed) - it tasted good at the time!  Like the rocking chairs too--seems other people really enjoy them as there was rarely one open. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Avoid this corrupt company... terrible! \nI sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeeking.\nThey did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned, the bill would be about $400.00\nI said no, bought $18.00 brake pads from another company, and did the repair myself in about an hour\nWhen I looked at the rotors, they were LIKE GLASS, in immaculate condition, absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement...  (the vehicle is only a few years old, with low mileage) \nThey completely tried to take advantage of my wife, fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck... they should be shut down... \nYou've been warned!! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stumbled across this class by accident. I had done spinning at home in the UK and had tried an LA Fitness class here in Phoenix which was ... ok. I came to Studio 360 and couldn't believe I didn't collapse in a crumpled heap on the floor. Somehow I kept going to the end of the class. It was HARD. I was completely addicted.\n\nI have since been going for probably about 6 months. In that time my father in the UK has been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and I really can be honest in saying that going to this class 2/3 times a week is the only time when I have 60 minute periods in which I don't feel like I'm crippled with fear and dread about what is happening at home. \n\nOh, and I've dropped 2 dress sizes. It would probably be more, but I REALLY like wine (I'm European. We drink. Too much.) So what my boyfriend affectionately refers to as my \""wine pouch\"" reamins. But I have abs underneath. \n\nMost importantly - for 60 minutes of the day I feel like a champion.\n\nThank you Studio 360. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The coffee here is atrocious. My \""latte\"" looks like someone took the government-funded chocolate milk we were fed as kids, and cut it with chalk-water. It tastes like someone forgot to remember to put the coffee grounds in the espresso machine, and all that came out was the grime residue on the inside of the pipes that got blasted off by scalding water. Then they took a huge vat of skim milk and burned the crap out of it and mixed it with water. They combined the two in my cup. I asked for less milk, hoping to be able notice some coffee flavor. But I still have a 10-oz. cup of flavorless grey water. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  3/5/10\nMy second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the \""atmosphere\"" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> A classic Italian restaurant. Tablecloths and such, but not too pretentious or upscale. Just a good restaurant. Service was excellent and attentive. The atmosphere is somewhat traditional, and business-like. You'd think you were in a scene in the Godfather. \n\nBut that's not what made it great.\n\nThe food was exquisite. From the perfect Italian breads, already brushed with olive oil, to the fluffy pasta crepe and nuanced sauce of the cannelloni, it was superb.\n\nBut that's not what made it great.\n\nThe wine list was thorough, but I just had the house red, which was a nice Chianti.\n\nBut that's not what made it great.\n\nThe cannoli. Don't leave this cannoli. OMG. I am a huge fan of a proper cannoli. By proper, I mean the filling should not be chalky. It should definitely not be custard. It really shouldn't be ricotta, but it's a cheaper cheese. The PROPER cheese should be mascarpone. The waiter promised it was, and every bit as good as what grandma used to make.\n\nIt was. I wanted to cry, it was so good. The filling was perfect - no chalkiness, no grit, no dryness. The shell was also perfectly cooked, just the right thickness and crispiness. It was like an out-of-body experience.\n\nGo here at least for the cannoli. Stay for the dinner too. Fantastic place, and I'd wager the best Italian in the southwestern United States. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I shop here because, it is the only place to get what I need in biking distance.  9 out of 10 times,  I am overcharged.  On my last 2 visits it was for over $4.  I make it a habit to go over my receipt, near customer service to collect my inevitable refund. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food is not real Indian food, everything they made for native people. If you really looking for tasty, spicy Indian food this place is not worth it. On all food items are sweet and more creamy.\nThis is place is not meant for real \""INDIAN FOOD LOVERS\"" <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Open 24 hours - only thing that rates a star; pharmacists lack customer service, time management, and efficiency skills <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The food was okay and the atmosphere was nice. Unfortunately the service was absolutely appalling. It took 30 minutes just for the waitress to take our drink order and another 30 for her to take our food order. She took even longer to collect the bill and run our card. We could see her chatting behind the counter with another employee. My boyfriend had to walk up to the counter to ask her to run our card as we had been waiting for so long. Considering there was only one other table in the whole restaurant this was ridiculous. Extremely disappointed with my experience and I will not be coming back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  The good: Nice ambiance, friendly service. I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. \n\nThe bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! \n\nIf you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). \n\nThe sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? \n\nThe ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!\n\nWhat about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. \n\nAre we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.\n\nSo why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt. Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; YMMV <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \n\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \n\nSo if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Cute little hole in the wall diner on the edge of Uptown. I work across the way from here and decided to pop in for lunch. They have a huge menu for such a little place - so I settled on the Quiche of the day - OMG - so yummy. I mean, it was the way quiche should be with a crisp light fluffy biscuity crust and a heavy egg base with good flavor - i wanted another piece when I was done. I got a side salad with it to save on carbs and that was very delish with a vinaigrette dressing.\n\nThat being said - this is a very no frills place. A little counter, some cheap tables and a self service drink area - it's a bit dark inside and the decor consists of some random framed prints here and there.\n\nRegardless of the lack of ambiance - the food is bringing the people in - the place had a good crowd at lunch time and the proprietor is a British lady who is very patient and friendly. \n\nI saw someone eating a burger and I was like - OH YEA! It did look very good - Diner Burger good. You know what I mean. Like, I am not counting calories, good.\n\nThe line moved pretty fast, you order at the counter, seat yourself and they call you when it's ready - you help yourself to the drink you ordered from a little area behind the counter - and just so you know, aside from soft drinks, coffee etc. They do have Perrier - which I love!\n\nI'll be back - very cute little old timey diner! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This is my first yelp review. I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. \n\nI first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However,  every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation, chicken was fried ahead of time,and fried again when you order, That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal.\n\nWell, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. \n\nFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. \n\nBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund.\n\nI have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever. It was so bad, I would not dear to try again. \n\nI do hope the owner sees this, and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further, and willing to be convinced to come back.\n\nSincerely <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Great value. I think this will become a regular place for me. Rebecca was great! I loved the long massage, and paraffin wax treatment, which I never got in any swanky Ballantyne/Southpark basic pedi that costs $20 more. The place is not fancy, but their service is outstanding. My one small complaint was that the chair was well-used and maybe not the most comfortable, but the massage feature worked just fine! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Pleasantly surprised.....with this little find!  We went there to see a friend from out of town play for a fundraiser for a child who is ill.  It's definitely something you'd find near the beach.  $3 drafts...and full bar.  Packed house....just North of the Vig UpTown.  Definitely a casual dive and fun too! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Charlotte-Douglas is a fairly nice, yet huge, airport.  Dining options are varied, and this airport has a lot to see and do during layovers.\n\nRocking Chairs are a huge plus :-D <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. \n\nI then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. \n\nThe \""stylist\"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said \""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\"" and the lady said \""oh we don't do that.\"" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. \n\nAnd waited, and waited, while one \""stylist\"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \""on break,\"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \""after I'm done here,\"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  (2.75 stars)  Charlotte-Douglas may be my favorite large airport in the Eastern US.  The arrangement of terminals is easy to maneuver, while the terminals themselves are well-lit and airy.  There are many dining and drinking options, and cool rocking chairs.  The gate waiting areas are too small, but there are better areas to wait.  The car rental experience is on-site and efficient.  TSA Security at Charlotte-Douglas seems to be able to expand during busy periods, and hasn't caused me any issues in dozens of flights.  While not close to downtown, getting to the airport (or from airport to city) has always been smooth.  The information booth folks are actually helpful; quite a change if you're arriving from Miami or NY/JFK.  A very late arriving flight once caused me to miss a connection and on that particular night finding a nearby motel was pretty easy. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> My family and I attended a wonderful performance of The Nutcracker today by Ballet Arizona under the artistic direction of Ib Andersen.\n\nOf all the many times I've seen this ballet, this is by far the most lavish production to date.  The costumes were ornately designed and complemented the colorful set pieces.   It was obvious that a great deal of time and detail went into the visual aspects of the show.  \n\nI actually just saw a performance last week by the Los Angeles Ballet Company of this same production.  While the production values of Ballet Phoenix were significantly higher, the LA Ballet had much better dancers and choreography.\n\nI think Ballet Arizona did a fantastic job.  The standing ovation by the thorngs of childern in the audience was proof of that. \n\nCheck it out! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  It's true...I have experienced better, much better.  I really want to like this place, but both times I've eaten here I have been unimpressed.  I ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa.  Ugh, first off, the avocado that came with the dish was old, not old like it could have been made into some tasty guac...it was dark and tasted like it should have gone into a compost bin rather than my mouth.  Second, the fruit looked as though it had been cut (or taken out of it's package) many days prior to hitting my plate, so I didn't even bother eating it.  Lastly, the freaking salsa looked so pale and gross that I just gave up on the meal entirely.  I was really disappointed with their obvious lack of care when it came to the quality of food they were sending out.  In no way would I have ever sent any of that food out had it been my restaurant.  The server was nice enough and the coffee mug was huge, but I won't be back, sorry kids...I gave you a second try and you came up short again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  This place is by far one of the nicest sushi bars I have visited. It's in a great location (love the Biltmore!) and it's seating outdoors is unbeatable. The staff is also dressed up in Japanese clothing. I love Zen32 for having a wonderful and peaceful ambiance.\n\nHowever, I am a sushiholic and while I do love a great place to enjoy my food, I value the quality of the food a bit more.\n\nZen32 sushi was just mediocre sushi. Not good, not bad, just okay. It wasn't enough to make me want to return for more :( \n\nSorry Zen32, you are gorgeous, just not the total package :( <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Worst service ever. Walked in and the woman rolled her eyes at me. Lol I'm not sure what I did. It was pretty empty and very clean. Walked around looking for a item for a good 15 min and no help. It want busy at all. The salons looked clean there was no staff for walk ins. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  I think this is named Cambridge Cleaners now. And it is $2.50 an item. But...having been a dry cleaners daughter I am not impressed. At all. Yes.....you get what you pay for but they are not able to get a simple salad dressing spot out of my husband's polo shirts. It has not been washed or thrown in the dryer which sets stains. It is not laundered- it is supposedly pre- spotted and then dry cleaned. 5 of the 7 had to be returned. I know it can come out. I have taken the very same shirts to another cleaners and voila- not a problem. SO why can't they get it out? I do not recommend and I won't go back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love this place...best pizza in Phoenix- hands down! Wings are amazing, service is always phenomenal. I simply love this restaurant. I have to admit that I may be a bit biased as this place holds a lot of sentimental value to me. My family and I have eaten here for years and years. At this point- 4 generations worth, that I know for sure, have dined at and loved Red Devil. My husbands favorite is the sausage and artichoke pizza- while mine is the Red Devil combo. We always split an order of medium wings and get bigger then we know we will eat- pizza so we can have some to bring home. \n\nThis restaurant also does well balancing the \""family friendly\"" with the \""date night\"" crowds. I will say that we live much closer to the Mesa (Tempe?) location and have gone there 4-5 times...completely not the same. Yes, same-ish food, but the other location just simply does not have it like the McDowell one. Dont waste your time at the other one- just go to the McDowell location and enjoy! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I love Cost Plus. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it tends to be a little expesive and this definitely stands for the furniture. I love the food section though! They have decent posters too... <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Just returned from RFBlues, where I usually enjoy myself quite a lot.\n\nThe bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer. No big\ndeal; pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken, assuming she's\ncolorblind. I waited.\n\nAnd had a 2nd drink.\n\nAnother group of 3 people came in after that, ordered their meals, and\ngot served their entrees.\n\nI went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be coming.\nShe announced that \""salmon takes longer to cook\"" (than what??? a raw\nsalad? I cook; salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cook!),\nand that \""I was about to check on that...\"" It had been over an hour by\nnow.\n\nI got my sandwich promptly after complaining.\n\nA few minutes later, when I finished my salmon, I got my side of\nvegetables (apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon to\ncook!).\n\nAll sarcasm aside: one screw up is tolerable. The second - forgetting\nto even check on my late order until I complained, an hour after I\nordered, is not. And yet, I wasn't given the least consideration in\nthe bill. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt. \nI'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason, on the warmest day of summer, the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.\n  \nThe food was fine, but again, when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Visited this place with a friend. i used a entertainment coupon for buy one menu item with two drinks and get 1 menu item free. I got the Guacamole Burger with fries. $9.99... The burger tasted much better than the Carl's Jr. Guacamole burger.\n\n The female servers looked good in their 50's style dresses. very hot looking. :)\n\n Fast service and good food. Try this restaurant, you will enjoy the food and the view of the female servers. lol <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I stopped by Bado's on a recent Wednesday for an early dinner with a friend. When I first walked in, I was rather surprised at the decor. The way Bado's is talked about and with this prime location, I imagined it to be more modern. I was wrong. Inside, it is your typical neighborhood pizza place/bar. Clean, well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu, I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous, we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup, a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise, I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out, the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust. Overall, good food for a neighborhood bar. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  We were hungry and I was thinking Chili's would be much like Applebee's. You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong. \nThe restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered \nNachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever! Stay Away! $30 for a awful appetizer and two entrees. Never again. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> Friendly and prompt service.  The French onion soup is great. The prices are a bit more than what one should pay for standard fare. Otherwise great place. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Terminal 2 is very basic and public wifi is a nofi. But I suppose it's not a major united hub, so I wouldn't expect their terminal to be top notch. However, who ever came up with the rental car facility solution should be buried in the middle of the Arizona desert! Not only is it way away from the terminals, it takes forever to get to when dropping the car off! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Good pizza - if you like sickening sweet sauce.\n\nYelpers, you seriously are high to give this joint anything over 2 stars.  Family friendly and family owned gets one star, maybe another star for homemade sausage, but that's about it.  $23 later and I feel like I had a Tombstone pizza with Prego sauce.  The garlic was foodservice pre-minced crap?  How difficult is it to chop some garlic?  \n\nDo yourself a favor - avoid and have a real pie.  No need risking Type II Diabetes from dinner. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  OK I hated it! I have eaten Mexican food all across North America and this is by far the worst! Seriously I would prefer to eat at Taco Bell than return here!\n \nThe building is all they have going for them. \n\nService is mediocre. If you read the menu you will see at the bottom that they will not split checks for a table and a few other will not rules! Come on people, how tacky and inhospitable can a eatery be!? My waitress was some young girl. She was okay but obviously not to experienced. \n\nMy food, left me dumb founded! I was having lunch. I ordered the steak fajita $11. It was a big meal with rice, beans, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, the fajita had lots of colorful peppers w/ onions and mushrooms! Never have I had mushrooms in a meat fajita, but okay I'll go with it. Then I bit into something that set my mouth a blaze! But beyond all that the food was SALTY! Yes the rice and beans as well! I could not eat it. I set there contemplating my hunger, what set before on the plates and the girth of my waist size, or to doggy bag it for my hound - I was ready to walk away when the waitress showed up and noticed my plate. When presented with the idea of a to go box, I broke down and told her it was to salty. She kindly offered to get me something else. Off the top of my head I said a chicken enchilada. It came out, and it was even worst! When asked if it was to my pleasing, I told a bold face lie! I said it was better, only meaning it was not as salty. Then I asked for a small sour cream, to cover the taste up in an attempt to make it look like I had eaten more of it then I intended. I picked at it but left more than half of it on the plate along with the sour cream (2 Tablespoons) that they charged me $2 for! \nI wanted a Sangria but opt not to attempt that recipe after experiencing the kitchen's recipes. Besides $7 for a glass of Sangria was a bit steep in my mind as well. \n\nIf you know me, you will soon learn I love a happy hour. I read their happy hour brochure and was not impressed. Basically half price on chips & two different dips and $5 drink specials. I'll pass on this as well. \n\nWild horses, horny handsome straight men, nor hunger or thirst will get me to return to Ajo Al's or recommend it. \n\nOh and it's not cheap for lunch nor dinner either, considering it's Mexican food and awful. Sure glad my Uncle Al could cook better than this. <|endoftext|>
