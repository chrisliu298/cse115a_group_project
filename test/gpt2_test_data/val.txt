<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  it was ok, the actual food was pretty good. the naan was nice, the seasoning on both of our dishes was very savory, however be warned medium is very very mild, that was our fault not there's.  My problem laid with the service and staff, the ambiance and the loud music.  The staff was grumpy the music was loud bollywood which i think was only on for the staff and yah, i just dont know.  I think as a takeout it would be ok.   it is probably actually a 2.5 but more of a two reaching for a three than a three sliding.    food itself was probably a 3.5 <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> [positive] <|sep|> I like this place. So far I have tried the hummus and the falafel, it was good. I  lived in Israel, so I have eaten my fair share of middle eastern cuisine. The only feedback I have is that the store looks a bit dirty. I think that could be a turnoff to some.... I think they could do a few things to freshen the place up and make it known they serve food, I think they would get more business this way, and people would not miss out on the great middle eastern cuisine. The man at the front desk is very kind as well. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Went here tonight, will never be back.\n\nThe food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.\n\nJust an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.) \n\nThe most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a \""sports bar\"" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up. \n\nNot only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.\n\nId like to be able to say \""Oh it was a busy night I understand.\"" But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn't have \""To go cups\"" and rolled her eyes.\n\nThis place obviously doesn't work as a team, and it shows..\nNever mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|>  Well, I would love to have tried this wonderful food that I read about in the reviews, but I guess I never will.  King Solomon's Pizza lost my business on the first try by playing a game I absolutely cannot stand.\n\nI ordered my pizza over the phone. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast.  As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said \""Don't you need my name and number?\"". He replied that it wasn't necessary. That should have clued me in.\n\nSo, I drive over to pick up my pizza.  I walk in and I'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter.  I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them.  One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY?\n\nSo I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there?  He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza.\n\nNice try JERKS.  I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere.\n\nApparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay. This same technique was used on me before a Chinese restaurant in west Phoenix. \n\nFool me once shame on me. Fool me twice, screw you! <|endoftext|>
