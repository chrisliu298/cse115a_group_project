# Sprint 1 Plan

Product name: TAPT

Team name: TFRL (Transformers with Reward Learning)

Revision number: 1

Revision date: 6/29/20

Sprint completion date: 7/6/20

## Goal

1. Be able to preprocess .txt and tabular dataset

2. Be able to fine-tune BERT-like text classification model

3. Be able to fine-tune GPT-2 model

4. Be able to classify sentiments (BERT)
5. Be able to generate positive/negative sentences (GPT-2)

## Tasks List

### User Story 1

As a user, I want a pipeline to preprocess .txt files so that I can have the data in the correct format to feed into the tokenizer.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4

### User Story 2

As a user, I want a pipeline to preprocess tabular data so that I can have the data in the correct format to feed into the tokenizer.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4

### User Story 3

As a researcher, I want to perform the text classification task using BERT-like models so that I can train a state-of-the-art text classifier.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4

### User Story 4

As a researcher, I want to perform the language modeling task using the GPT-2 model so that I can have a customizable GPT-2 text generate of text in any genre.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4

### User Story 5

As a researcher, I want to perform the language modeling task using the GPT-2 model so that I can use it for a weak-signal controlled generation task.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4

### User Story 6

As a researcher, I want to use a fine-tuned BERT-like model so that I can use it as a supervisor of my GPT-2 generator during PPO training.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4

### User Story 7

As a researcher, I want to build a text classification pipeline so that I can use it to evaluate test accuracy.

1. Data Set 1
2. Data Set 2
3. Data Set 3
4. Data Set 4
