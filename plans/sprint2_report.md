We completed all the user stories in our second version of sprint 2 plan, including:

- As a researcher, I want to set up the training loop of GPT-2 with PPO training so that it can do controlled generation (IMDb).
- As a researcher, I want to come up with multiple sets of possible hyperparameters so that I can test which set works the best (IMDb).
- As a researcher, I want to fine-tune the GPT-2 model using PPO training so that it can serve as the core data augmentation model (IMDb).
- As a researcher, I want to perform the language modeling task using the GPT-2 model so that I can use it for weak-signal controlled generation task (Yelp polarity).
- As a researcher, I want to use a fine-tuned BERT-like model so that I can use it as a supervisor of my GPT-2 generator during PPO training (Yelp polarity).
- As a researcher, I want to set up the training loop of GPT-2 using PPO training so that I can fine-tune it with reward learning (Yelp polarity).

## Work completion rate:

- Total number of user stories completed: 
- Total number of estimated ideal work hours: 
- Total number of days: 7
