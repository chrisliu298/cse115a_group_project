Product name: TAPT

Team name: TFRL

Revision number: 2

Revision date: 

Sprint completion date:

## Goal

1. Be able to train GPT-2 with PPO
2. Be able to generate sentences with higher quality by using optimized GPT-2
3. Be able to fine-tune BERT-like text classification models with Yelp polarity
4. Be able to fine-tune GPT-2 models with Yelp polarity
5. Be able to classify sentiments (BERT)
6. Be able to generate sentences similar to the training data (GPT-2)

## Tasks List

**User story 1:** As a researcher, I want to evaluate the augmented data by human examination so that I know the quality of the generated text.

| Task Index | Task | Task Time |
| :--------: | ---- | --------- |
|     1      |      |           |
|     2      |      |           |
|     3      |      |           |

**User story 2:** As a researcher, I want to evaluate the augmented data by training a Transformer/RNN model so that I know the quality of the generated text.

**User story 3:** As a researcher, I want high-level abstraction so that I can focus on the data augmentation instead of the model or code.

**User story 4:** As a researcher, I want to see fully comment code so that I can refer to the source code when I need to.

**User sotry 5:** As a researcher, I want to see correctly formatted code so that it is easy to read.

**User story 6:** As a researcher, I want a fully functional pipeline so that I don't need to assemble the parts manually.

**User story 7:**  As a researcher, I want to generate extra training data so that I can examine its quality
