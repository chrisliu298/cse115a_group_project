My third timing coming. I really want to work with these ladies but they have so many issues that I am just not going to risk making a mistake. I am stuck with a ring on my finger and have had them change it about three times over the last 2 1/2 years. 	0	1
I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball sub sandwich but found it to be very boring. I did like the Manhattans. They were good. \n\nI went for a Friday night with the wife and several of our friends.  The service was great. 	0	1
OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of my fellow Yelpers.  The service is pretty bad.  The tables don't line up on time at all, you have to walk an extra few feet to get to your table.  The takeout stuff that you get is edible.  When you have one entree on your order, you don't even bother with getting it refilled (which is my worst nightmare at every Chinese restaurant).  The tatso rice is edible.  The vermicelli is tasty.  I had my food reheated and it was not crispy as one would expect.  I'll come back here again but will only order the panko chicken and broccoli with rice.  Or maybe not at all.    Also - check out the little address on the menu -  order online to place a reservation. 	1	0
"So I used the \""""CHAT ONLINE with an agent\"""" option on Yelp for my business when I got their general manager and all of a sudden she was calling all of her contacts to see if I'd been on their hit list. How nice of her to act as a little friendly \""""newcomer\"""". Her phone is extremely busy so this got me so excited I called back immediately and asked if they had my card. The agent hung up on me and made it seem that I called someone else instead. I am not sure if that is an agent problem, a loose policy or just new to the program so I'll let you decide. "	1	0
After moving to the big city, I realized just how bad Whole Foods had it.  The produce is always much better and the shopping selection is actually better than at Trader Joe's and Hachette.  There's no reason for you to go to a major grocery store that's at least 20 years old and be disappointed in your food.\n\nThe menu choices are limited to pretty much everything you can think of at the grocery store.  The stuff in the bulk bins is edible.  The produce is all good, but not great.\n\nThere are a lot of coupons and discounts for Whole Foods and I plan to shop here regularly in the future.\n\nIf you haven't tried Whole Foods, then go now.  If you are interested in Whole Foods, I'd suggest you stop into the Hard Rock right now! 	1	0
Mmmmmm. \n\nHad the Harvest-something-or-other(english muffin topped with cream cheese, fresh fruit and whipped cream) and I would've bet you that I would've loved every second of it. I finished it and brought it home to my girlfriend and she says it's way too sweet. I can't speak for the original, though. \n\nNot sure how they carry the menu but they do make burgers and sandwiches and they do offer ice cream. \n\nThe food is good-I would recommend giving it a try-and I'm all for it-but it's not worth the aggravation of going out to lunch and NOT eating something you'll have to kill yourself trying to eat. 	1	0
When traveling, I look for location, amenities and comfort, plus being outdoors it's very clean. I've been to this location and it was ok, but on the other hand, the membership is great. 	0	1
OK -- not much else to add to what has already been said about this place.  But I don't see that it'll stay in business for very long (or for very long at all, because it's just so damn nice to walk into a great place like this and not be insulted by its exterior).\n\nThe attitude of the owners there is equally dismissive of my presence in the restaurant.  The worst thing I saw was a guy doodling a weird mural on one of the walls.  I think I know what he was doing there.  His wife's older son proceeded to paint it on the wall, then run away laughing (she didn't look up, I don't think.)  \n\nAll in all, the bar/grocery counter area is not that great, so don't expect much in the way of pop-ups and other hipstery stuff.  But other than that, it's pretty good.\n\nBack to business:  the bar is mostly older, has nice-looking backsplash, and there's a food court to the right of it that serves up pretty basic things like pasta, soup, etc.  This seems to be where the food comes from, if they really pay attention to it and do their researc	1	0
The homemade fresh polish sausage is definitely 5 star but it gets very inconsistent.  I don't know what is going on and they usually have two different types of sausage.  Even the soup is not anything special.  You get what you pay for.\n\nThe service is mediocre at best and that is saying something since it's a Saturday night and we didn't even ask for free water to wash our hands with so I really could have done without the schnitzel.  What a waste.  I like the food but I do not recommend it at all. 	1	0
I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon restaurant worthy of my name.  The staff is excellent, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is unique.  The day it opened I got a fish sandwich for delivery and it was so amazing.  I will soon find a new phoenix and dragon restaurant to dine at. 	0	1
Be prepared to sleep...to sleep deep...and sleep well...and hard. I slept hard when I did. I got to show up for my 11am appointment, which was no problem...and I didn't feel like an idiot for missing it. It was a Saturday night, and I didn't want to be stumbling around waiting for my out of town girlfriend to come to find out how I felt...so I gave her the signal to get on her case. \n\nI've had a pretty steady practice schedule for the last 6 years, and I don't think I've experienced an ER visit this bad in a while. Dr. Brady is quite the calm and pleasant gentleman. We didn't know one another, but he came across as calm and competent. My daughter did get a hip replacement, which required monitoring for a while, and I wasn't in the waiting room for a while, but when it was time to go in for an exam, the visiting orthopedist wasn't either, so I was completely fine with that.\n\nIt's a fairly well-run practice, and I feel like I've never had any type of difficulty getting seen. They do a pretty good job of charging for general anesthesia, though. I won't be returning. 	1	0
"If your interested in bull dogs and favoritism,  you've come to the right place.  The owners are nice, and the staff are exceptionally kind.  The staff wants to get your business and they are happy to meet you at the door.  The water fountains are free, the desserts are tasty and the spinner seats are nice and comfy.  It's inexpensive and fun.  If you're not into bulldogs, get a different dog.   I got my boy Bavarian to be a bulldog.  It was not a good Bulldog at all.  He is neutered and very friendly.  I got an Irish Mastiff because he's been a much more active dog and puppy than he should have been.  They turned out great!\n\nBut, I will go on record saying, that there's no other \""""Buddha-owned\"""" pet store that can compare. "	0	1
Went to Texaz on a whim wanting some steak and chips after hearing good things about it. The place was pretty empty, but they gave me the space to sit down. I ordered a Double Big Mac and my partner ordered a chicken sandwich. We both got a side of fries. The food arrived very fast and all the fries had great flavor. I really enjoyed my meal and wished for more. For about $10, I got better food than I would have at any of the big steak houses around my city. I think the service was good and the place is located in an older area. The only drawback is that it was very loud. We had no complaints about that. 	0	1
The store was very clean and well stocked. The womens clothing selection was nice. The order system was pretty simple. The main reason for giving the store 2 stars is because the woman working the register was very friendly. There was no issue with the crew with the takeout food or the students. Overall the overall experience was a positive one. 	0	1
I can't find it in myself to say something bad about Pamela's but I do have to say that it's one of the worst burger places I've ever been to.  There is nothing better for me than a giant burger with onions, fries, and a side of corn bread.  Pamela's fails this test, but when you know they are going to serve you big french fries with no onions, then you know it's pretty good.  The burger is very, very greasy.  It is all oil and to me, that's just not so appetizing.  And the fries?  They're nice and crisp and on the whole average fries that don't have too many of the healthiest chemicals floating around in them (like hydrogenated oils).  So, the fries aren't bad, but I would have preferred some of that disgusting oil and a nice, good bun.\n\nThere are only two ways to eat Pamela's: go to their Rokerij location or go back to the Rokerij location.  I probably will go back to the Rokerij location as I still go there for take out almost everyday.  As for my opinion of the restaurant, for what it's worth, it's not bad.  Just bad. 	1	0
What's this, a fifth review of a hotdog stand?  Yes it's run by a family of five, but it's not to come down on other items.  Keep in mind that to say 2.25 is too much for this place is like saying that a 10 inch steak is too much for a burger stand.\n\nThis place is big and proud.  Plenty of seating and although it can get very busy it doesn't stop me from enjoying the food, the beer selection, or the place.  On a recent visit I managed to get a bucket of mustard with my hotdog, tasty and filling.  But if I'm really craving fries this place is the place.\n\nNot impressed at all at all. 	1	0
This is a stunning vintage modern showroom with more of a chic indie vintage feel.  The prices are almost too good to be true but the selection is far more diverse and I'd even say it's just as interesting to shop as it is to sit in.\n\nThe only drawback is that they're a bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of clients who come in daily and there's only so much space.  While there is plenty of room in the last, and even sometimes the doorway to the back is wide open, the rest of the place is cramped.  What's more, the ceilings are extremely thin and do not support their weight well - even when there's other good work to be done.  My colleagues and I would recommend taking your shoes to go, and walk past most of the other store's mid-priced/mid-high end work pieces, to save yourself a couple dollars. 	0	1
"I don't know how we even came across this complex. It seemed really boring. The process of finding a movie was so difficult. When we did find a movie, we were very disappointed. We didn't see any science fiction or horror movies.

"I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a trendy joint and I've been here many times.  It's the perfect mixture of casual and establishment.  The food is right off the wall and not super fancy.  But the ambiance is the best part of the place, especially if you're after a mixed drink (here's a tip: On your way out, try to pick up some sides to make your Mexican take home).\n\nA few months ago, while we were at the Esplanade, I decided to get a Tacos Grande - 2 quesadillas in one with cheese and sour cream and jalape\u00f1o-nostalgic salsa.  And boy was it good.  I'd have a medium taco topped with a few refried beans and shredded cheese and filled with what I imagine the enchilada portion would be (that's just my suppositional thinking).  The Margaritas are also fantastic.

I used to LIVE at The Swizzle Inn and sadly it burned down and I had to move out. I just recently moved in with my friend from work and we lived at the Swizzle Inn for a few months and have been looking for a place to call our own for some time.\n\nSo we have been searching for a place to live for some time and thankfully found this place in the Bearcats area. We rent a house and are looking to move, we call ourselves the Camelback Stable. We are very close to work and the place was very quiet and nice. It is spacious and close to everything. It is great to live close to friends and work in a good area.\n\nSo we lived there for a couple months and then a new owner bought it and I have not been back since and I am sad to say, we are in serious trouble. We found a new place that is less than 20 mins away and there is no one around to take care of things. The new owner that moved in is not paying for the pool. The problem is not with the pool, the problem is with the grounds they have left in the parking lot, we call it ground dirt. \n\nThe front yard is as dirty as it gets. It is ridiculous.

I feel as though I needed to write this review. I stayed here 3 months ago to see the American Dance Theatre. I was excited about the theater. I had heard so many great things about it. The management was great. The theater is beautiful. I was so excited to see it, especially since we never went. When we arrived the lobby was nice and bright. There were signs out front warning us about the bad weather and parking. That was good. The actual show was fine but I wish it was a little better. The sound was extremely loud. I heard all kinds of girls sing and holler and dance and squeal and all kinds of entertainment stuff that made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. I would have liked it to have been louder. That said, it was great!\n\nWe were there on a Friday night at 2:15. It is quite a long wait for a Friday night. We sat at the bar, did drinks, and waited. At the end of the wait the waitress came by. She said she would be right back, but they were out of food and she would have to get some. She brought us food. They also had red beans and rice and some bread and some salsa. The salsa was good and the red beans were wonderful. The red beans were not greas	0	1
Want to let everyone know that, years later, Preferred Parking still hangs around here.  The idea is to give you a little something extra every time you park.

"I've been a resident of this \""""beautiful\"""" community for three years now and have found it to be one of the most \""""unfriendly\"""" communities I've ever experienced.

Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times since moving in.   The service is always top notch, and they treat you like family.  \n\nI love this place.  It's great for older people with big families, and their lunches are so flavorful.  My favorite in town is an Old Navy - my husband loves the fries too.  No arguments with them.  But if you are looking for a true family style, or even trendy place - this is not the place.  It's just not. 	0	1
Overrated, yes.\nFun, yes.\nSomething different in a very Midwestern town, yes.\nAwful, yes.\nThe lack of multiple options in all parts of town, yes.\nThe requirement to write your own menu in order to sit at the bar, yes.\nThe seemingly endless amount of signage and signage mostly lost, yes.\nAnd, if you count the aforementioned banter as appropriate conversation, yes.\n\nUnfortunately, all of that may be part of the charm... at least for the most part.\n\nThere are a few redeeming qualities about this place.\n\nFor starters, it's pretty close to Chicago and does its best to be.\n\nSecondly, they do everything they can to accommodate everyone.  T-shirts are laundered, and of course, drink specials.  \n\nThirdly, their beer list is constantly growing.  There are several I'd assume are Chicago imports, but the beer list is constantly growing (read: that's been changing).\n\nLastly, the food is decent.

Let me say, this is not a store where the employees greet you when you walk in. This is a Super Market. The employees themselves are friendly, but not rude. I came in here for a medical procedure and was totally ignored by the employees. I was there for under 3 hours, maybe 4 hours if you count my meal and then back. The employees came by my booth after my surgery and left without saying a word to me. When I came back a few days later and checked out they had not even looked at the box. I called and was told they had forgotten about me. They will NEVER come back here for any reason. As for their loyalty policy? No. And in a world where my baby niece has giant breasts this will cost them money in the long run! It makes no sense. 	1	0
I've gone to Rollier's a lot over the years whenever I travel for business.  I've always had a good experience, and when you have to support a family member to get back to work, I'm always willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWe were craving Italian food when we were here one Saturday night.  We ended up getting two salads and two ravioli (no secret, no begging, just two simple appetizers that, for our liking, lacked any kind of presentation).  The main course was the most basic salad and pasta dish that I've had anywhere.  It came with some kind of cream sauce (basil is your friend) and a small red sauce which was basically pasteurized apple juice.  When I tried the main dish it tasted way more like the standard type of pasta.  To my surprise, it was a winner.\n\nIt had about 8 toppings (tomatoes, basil, mascarpone, red peppers, crab meat, and maybe a couple more) and two saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  It was cheap, so we ordered two of them.  When we were finally served, we quickly accepted our misfortunate share of deliciousness.  \n\nThe cheese plate that came wit	0	1
There is never a time when I have felt that I needed to leave the office.  This was one of those times.  \n\nI only stopped in on my way home from the hotel to pick up my kids from the park.  I was waiting for about 5 min until I noticed it was a busy lunchtime and didn't want to wait for someone else to pick up my kids.  I told the clerk to check and was given a free-to-try menu which was on the table as I was taking them in.  I walked up and ordered the barbeque shrimp and steak burrito.  I went with my companion who ordered the green chile and he said he loved his meal and really enjoyed it.  \n\nI was shocked how delicious it was.  I had tried several of the restaurant's food, but I was surprised at how good this was.  The sauce was a nice spicy heat and had a nice tinge to it.

OK.  We've all been here a million times in two locations and each time it's been fun.  It's a big restaurant but the server is always super friendly.  On a cool night, we made our way there for dinner.  The food is well cooked and I don't recall much greasy hands, which was nice.  I've never really been impressed by them so I never thought this place was very good but I got the bill for it.\n\nThe waiter was more or less professional, but I don't think I had much to complain about.  He was attentive and focused on making sure my food was good and remembered what I ordered.  I was not too impressed with anything he prepared for us.  We ordered two entrees, a salmon salad and the bruschetta.  Salad: two slices of salmon, potato and a fried egg.  Oh, and there was some dressing.  Potato (Not Original) - a flat sort of overcooked slab of white, sweet potato with a big flaky fennel root in the center.  It was rather tough and not really tasty.  Dressing was at best ordinary, as was the salmon.\n\nBruschetta: a stack of tender goat cheese, cream cheese, bacon	1	0
I'm a huge fan of Kohls and moving to the airport definitely pushed me over the edge. The experience was great, the staff was pleasant, and the staff was knowledgeable. I understand the difficulty of this concept, but that said, it's fun to go a few minutes early and see a Macy's before heading out. \n\nMy only complaint was that I felt rushed into buying so much stuff for my family. There were 1.5 hour blocks of stuff, and all they had available was a few sweaters, a few phones, and a few dresses. Still, it's still a Kohls and as good as it can get. \n\n--- 	0	1
"This use to be my go to Panera Bread.  My coworkers would bring me there and I would say \""""So, when can we go again?\""""  The woman behind the counter would look at me like I was crazy and she would say \""""We don't do take-out...\""""   Then she would ask what I wanted and what was good...and she would probably take my order.  \n\nBut that all changed about a year ago...\n\nI want to like Panera Bread for the good food but I hate it for the customer service issues.

Nobody understands. I have this weird affinity for Tokyo Express. This airport just happens to be the best for me. I've been to places like New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, Dallas, Washington D.C. (where I had to run to a different terminal because of the long TSA lines), LAX, Phoenix, Tokyo, Beijing, Tokyo Express and no less then four major airports I've flown through. Ahem...it just isn't this big of a deal for me. Terminal 2 and 3 are super small. The patios are so small (and oddly loud) that it is downright awkward to sit out on the US Airways concourse while watching every flight head out.  The rest of the terminals are connected by escalators with moving sidewalks that are designed to be tricky if your legs are any good.  Getting around the terminals is not only a chore, it's often a nightmare.  Not only are they tiny, but getting out of your car is a nightmare.  Plus, security here is a joke. When I was in terminal 1, I had to find a bunch of security officers and ask them to cut my jacket around my neck and then guide me to the gate.

Dear Pittsburgh, we are foodies from Boston.  The wonderful section at Whole Foods is all you need to know about The Burgh.  Actually, all you need to know about the Burgh is that it is in someones backyard.  It's an area of back woods with little other than bungalows and cheap, dated shops and restaurants.\n\nWhole Foods has something for everyone.  There is a seemingly endless amount of stuff to choose from.  The selection seems to shrink at the end of the year, as it used to, and even on Thanksgiving or Christmas, you are sorely disappointed with what you get.\n\nEveryone knows how good it is to have a large selection of goodies and organic farm fresh goods to sell and eat.  I was disappointed when Whole Foods had a full on section dedicated only to organic ingredients.  I probably would not return to it if it was just home made goods.\n\nYou should also know, however, that Whole Foods carries more than the usual supplies for other foodies to need.  You can get even more if you just head to their online store and purchase goods that they will hand out and for at least the next few months they will have fresh items in stock.\n\nOverall, it's good.

BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRETTY MUCH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE \nI am going to write this review with the degree of anger that I have for the restaurateur. We had a wonderful birthday party and took a trip to the Italian restaurant by this restaurant. We were visiting as a few of our friends have been to Olive Garden before and were in town so we wanted to go on that trip. \nWe arrived at 5:40pm. The restaurant was about 100% full and it was a good thing too because then we were about to head to the bar. We knew that the chef was busy so we told him to hurry up and put us on the list and he gave us some suggestions on what to order. I like to order salads with orange juice so I ordered the Basil Olive Garden Salad, a Caesar Salad with garlic, and a Morel Salad with Mashed Potatoes.\nI was hoping for a salad with balsamic dressing or anything to accompany my salad as there was no balsamic in my salad but it was a pretty good salad. I would love to have one of the best salads from this restaurant. It was fresh, quality food with excellent service. It was less than a five minute walk from our house so it was worth the walk.\nSo after waiting almost an hour I ended up paying 	0	1
This place has its pros and cons. It's a great break when you're just getting out of the bar and into the food. For lunch, you can get a burger, a salad, or a side of fries. It's great for a quick lunch.\n\nThe thing I dislike about this place is the alcohol selection. It's a whole lot of beer on tap and only one wine on tap. I know this isn't because it's so big, it's because people get intoxicated just by looking at it, but I don't think I would recommend this place for anything but a full liquor education at your local bar.\n\nOverall, this place is good, and the food is average but close to home. I'd probably recommend going for lunch, and probably drinking somewhere else. 	0	1
I went strictly based on the referral of a friend. The buffet food was good, it was almost as if I was just asked to eat a salad. The service was good, they were prompt and chatted with us for the entire meal. If I go to a Phoenix buffet this will be our first choice. 	0	1

I work right down the street from La Tolteca so it seemed like the perfect place to start my #BiltmoreFitnessDay ritual. The reason I never reviewed it is because of all the people it serves; it's my favorite place to get a well-rounded workout. I was pleasantly surprised when it came to my workout with my younger son. All that hard work pays off when you take your kid to La Tolteca. \n\nThe service and the menu choices are phenomenal. I would never expect a full-service lunch joint to be available and comfortable for people of all ages but it was perfect for us. I especially loved that my older son got a warm, all-day meal with veggies and rice and enjoyed it so much that he left full!\n\nThere is a little bit of everything here, so make sure you have something to do before or after your workout. You'll want to bring a notebook or something for notes to keep track of your progress and even spice up your day with a mini art project. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the amount of service you'd expect but I'd give it another shot. I'll probably return just to grab a couple bite-sized bites of the delicious soup you order in the machine (it was ho	0	1
Let me start by saying, I NEVER had a bad meal here. We had the Redtail Burro and the Blue Fin and both were very good. The Redtail was so creamy, fresh and my husband had the king crab and rice. All of the entrees were excellent. The only drawback was that they don't give out soda so if you want to drink it before dinner you're out of luck. The place is clean and the ambiance is nice. I was not impressed by the desserts but the service was always very good. 	0	1
I go to this location fairly regularly and have never had problems with service.  The food is good and the staff is always friendly and quick to come to your aid.  However, this location is very easy to get in and out of and I have to say that they do the most honorable job by saving me a trip when I need to go into an emergency room for urgent reasons.  \n\nI will give them the benefit of the doubt and say the place has gotten very cozy with the rest of the family in the past few years, and now that Dr. Stone is here, maybe it's time for it to get more serious with maintenance on time. 	0	1
Alright, I've got the same hangup most others have about this airport - very small and over crowded.  But I still like to eat here, so I'm going to keep it real.  This is not the East coast version of Las Vegas.  The people are extremely uptight, the booths are ridiculously expensive, the phones are useless, and the employees are overly friendly and accommodating.  They don't appear to have any desire to make things better.  The food, on the other hand, is what you want to go to.  As many of you already know (my mom and I are regulars), if you order at the bar and then drive across the parking lot to go to a food court, you WILL pay $50-$60 more per person than you would to go through TSA again.\n\nThe airport itself is nice and clean.  There is a mini basketball court and some open green spaces in the sky, which allows for even small groups to be seated.  Some people complain about the $10 or $20 per person monthly food pass but I like to think that's for the summer.  The staff here seem friendly.  And the pace and comptency of their friendly service seems to be improving.  Last time I checked the airport itself was much busier than it i	0	1
"I loved the Merc Bar during my first visit, last visit...but my love for yelp's reviews was short lived. My dining experience there was such a disappointment.  First, you get a \""""Welcome to Merc\"""" sign for the whole place, which made me think the bartender was somehow hiding something, but then one of the three tables did have a wine tray with several bottles on it and they were all empty (totally normal for a bar that I had never visited). Second, the food was NOT that good. I ordered the $5 Lobster Rolls with vegetables, which I LOVE (they're wonderful - only 2 stars). However, my shrimp were undercooked, the pulled pork was dry (which they charge extra for), and I couldn't finish a few bites because my tongue was so full. I ended up not finishing my entire plate, which I was disappointed about, but at least I didn't end up in the Emergency Room. \n\nMy friend's lobster mac & cheese was the best I've ever had, so I'm pretty sure I've been at least once. It was moist, succulent, buttery, and had almost no mayo on it. My family enjoyed the spring rolls, but my friend's steakhouse steakhouse filet was virtually non-existen"	1	0
I loved Postino's. Loved, as in past tense. Living in Southern Illinois for 9 years, I know what to expect and have been very spoiled by the likes of Postino's. I won't keep saying that it's great. It's not. But I will add that it's very good, reasonably priced and relatively clean, even when going out on a Sunday afternoon. (Which usually means its live music after dark.)\n\nI love Aveda, but aveda carries a LOT of capitalized weight in the Chicago market. So it's not surprising that Postino's is able to peddle such high quality without giving a damn about Chicago culture or reputation. 	0	1
Had a groupon for this place so thought we would try it out.  The food was pretty good.  The service was nice as well.  The girl behind the bar was very friendly and was able to understand my questions.  I really loved the churros that we had.  They had three different ones on the menu to choose from.  There was no salsa but they did have so much hot sauce I thought they were missing something.  The girl in the kitchen kept things topped off the right way and the hot sauce was pretty good.  Other than that I could not give the meal any stars.  It was a pretty big meal so we won't be back.  The place was busy during lunch so do expect to wait to sit down.    Our waiter finished our water and was very nice about helping me check my watch. 	1	0
I'm wondering if it is even worthwhile for me to continue reviewing this bar.  I don't know if I should be happy or outraged.  I should be horrified.  So, after much thought, I leave that review.  I'll just say, I'm sorry to have to ruin your restaurant experience.\n\nWe arrived and were seated immediately.  Nice nice lights.  That just makes the place feel welcoming.  It's just a bar!  Don't get me wrong, I've been to other great bars and nice things, but I love good bar food.  Bars have great menu choices.  I'm not necessarily knocking Great Dane for that.  I just don't think great bar food should rely on hiding such aspects from the consumer.\n\nAnd, I just want to note that the lady working the bar, Charlotte, is wonderful.  She was so sweet and friendly.  I almost wished for the jazz club type of atmosphere.  Anytime someone comes to a bar, they should be given an itemized list of all the food items that they will be served and are supposed to eat with.  They should also be told that they can bring other friends along to order food.  \n\nNext time we were at the Arrowhead we decide	0	1
Items don't have price tags. That's the only reason why I picked this place out.  Don't get me wrong, I like nice elegant old houses, but not cheap takeout Chinese takeout.

"I recently found out I was pregnant and was researching options for delivery. I could not find any good doctors in my area. Dr Y is my friend and he recommended me to Dr. Grant. I told him I was concerned about my health and he said, \""""Oh, is that OK?\"""" He's very pleasant and kind.  He isn't overbearing nor pushy. He has never suggested I go through chemo or radiation. He's just, you know, like asking if you need to rest. I can't speak for the other doctors, but as far as my health concerns, they should also be considered. He was honest about what was going on with me, and is very pleasant with me. He helped me discuss my concerns with the doctors, and gave them suggestions on when to see me. After waiting a month for the baby, it's a busy day, so it's hard to see him. "	0	1
My wife went to Cali nails to get manicure and pedicure and was very disappointed. The service was great, the woman who checked in was very patient and knowledgeable, and there was even a big surprise for her that day. Not to mention, the people we spoke with were very nice as well. While we are obviously disappointed that we won't be going back, we appreciate that there are many other nail salons in town with more friendly and helpful staff. 	0	1

I own a property managed by the Osselaer for a company named Enterprise Management. I have been here for 4 years and for the same basic reason as all other properties managed by Osselaer (water and landscaping), this property is pretty much average.    The grounds are pretty well manicured but there are a number of areas that need a little polishing.  Most recently I've done a hole in the wall filling job.  I could do a lot of it myself if I focused on the area and didn't over go the garden system.  \n\nThere is one other remodel going on this week on the property.  Both items were completed and there is a new front gate that sits down about 6 inches from the existing gate.  We are in the middle of doing a much needed low light overhaul for the property and it was a labor of love and we are super excited to get these finished.   \n\nAnother thing that I thought was very nice was they didn't have all the apartments as I had hoped, but they only had an extra bedroom and they had all the laundry done and ready for pickup.  It was nice to be able to call them when I needed it.  It's almost as if they wanted me to look over and check in with the	0	1
I may be a little biased... this place is right up my alley.  I like to stay in business for the long term and stay in business for the long haul.\n\nThe place is old and smelly.  I got the red and white carpet with the white and purple trim that comes with a chipotle stain and find the clientele pretty typical.... upscale college kids and older professionals in their early forties or even mid-20s. \n\nThe bartender was so nice to us.  I just wish he was a bit more attentive to my needs.\n\nBut good food and a nice environment keep me coming back. 	1	0
So excited to hear that this Michael's is soon to open near our house.  I am so excited to see it.  So glad the owner is really having fun in the kitchen!  We have been going there for years and don't really get the same side dishes or service that I usually get when I go.  \n\nI really enjoy their cornbread pancakes and Mac & Cheese.  But the bad news is, they are so expensive.   I told our server yesterday that I was going to have to get a credit card to get those at Michael's.  That is EXTREMELY frustrating as I'm not sure that they charge $5 for a drink.  I like to sit outside and cook my own food but this isn't the place.\n\nSo, I would just like to avoid the wait area and go to anything that is smaller and not high end. 	0	1
Dude. We're over here. No? No eye contact?  Too bad...this place is overrated. It's just that good. I actually ordered a sandwich and it was AWESOME. I'd say the meat was fresh and just as juicy as other places.\n\nThe staff is SUPER friendly and helpful. 	0	1

I tried a couple sausages I was expecting more from DANA but their sausages were less than average. I would have liked them to use their good quality sausage and not try to push it to not be good. This was my first time at the BK and it was a good experience. My meal did not include alcoholic beverages and they can get served alcohol at most eateries but we got there early and they were happy to do so. I could have done a lot better myself and ordered from a different German restaurant. 	1	0
You only know how good a service is when things go smoothly. There was an issue with my order and I had to call back because the cashier had run out of time to get my order. We also didn't know if they were working on the over the counter menu (we were unsure if they had one) so we spent the whole time waiting for our food to arrive. However, our food arrived very quickly. That didn't matter at all because the service, on top of our incompetence, was just top notch! I will never go back. 	1	0
My first ever trip to Woody-Anne's involved a lady at the checkout asking if I would like the discount on her hair.  I gave her a blank stare and she proceeded to ask if I wanted to get the customer service discount on my hair.  I said, well I'll just go in first.  So I do and order my hair cut.  At first I thought maybe they didn't want to hear me.  My stylist wasn't there that day.  I walk back in there and the girl (she's not the big girl I like) asks me how my hair is.  Um, how you doing?  I told her how great my haircut was.  The big girl just gives me another blank stare and walks away.  \n\nA year later my stylist is there and I say what happened.  She says that the lady that I talked to the first time was there and she doesn't have that coupon.  My stylist, therefore, can't use her coupon.  No I'm not going to give that customer any kind of discount.  That's one point in favor of them not letting people go there.\n\nIf you need to make a haircut, this place is the place.  Just order online or go to the salon in downtown Charlott	1	0
The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. The bartender actually entered the bar to let us know it was too hot to eat here, so he took us elsewhere. I went in after my friend left and while I'm not sure he came in to do the worst possible job, the waitress was awful. She was incredibly rude and didn't know what she was doing. Had she asked us what we wanted, I would have chosen a Diet Coke. She also didn't know our alcoholic beverage selections. I also never saw a bill. I'll tell you that Tram's does have a pretty good Yelp rating. For $6.50 for a pitcher of punch and an order of 3-4 options, it wasn't bad. \n\nDo yourself a favor, and stop by before your next family member or friend visits your home. They will likely be impressed. 	1	0

Where to start with this review?  I will first state that this review is not for the Macayo's on Faneuil.  The food is awful, the service is awful, the beer is awful, and the atmosphere is awful.  I do have to say that the booths are killer and I have never felt like I was in a museum (no tables?).  My wife has been taking her family to Macayo's for years and we have a good memory for the grease and the bad service.\n\nSo we have a reservation and leave our table.  I waited for 20 minutes (not including the wait for our waitress to bring our drink order) to be seated.  Upon entering I saw our server standing by the door.  I was shocked because she had not even came in.  Now, we don't give a shit about the weather and I don't want to write a review about a restaurant where I might miss a flight, but we were expecting it and are just as shocked that she had not even gotten to us.  I know it was not her fault and I understand that when there are hundreds of people there, she might be late.  But she just walked by me while I was sitting on the bench next to our table.  \n\	1	0
Bring your wallet or if you have little self control you won't be able to get in and out of this place.  \n\nThe food is adequate.  My friend had the corned beef hash and it was perfectly cooked to his liking, and as far as I can tell I haven't had a bad meal here.  I've never really been impressed by El Salvadorian food, but as I said before this is much better than most of the IHOP restaurants I've been to.\n\nI also wasn't a big fan of their beers.  They have drafts and red and gold and there is no age restriction but their signature wine is still the Bock.  Not impressed. 	1	0
This airport is just kinda weird. I went to the airport yesterday (July 6) and was simply put off by the amount of traffic they have there. A lot of it is traffic. At one point I had to walk two blocks to re-enter the USN terminal because I had to bypass all of the traffic. However, there was still a lot of traffic as well which made me feel much better about my experience. \n\nThe main gate is where the really cool runway is located. I had to walk a lot to get to it, and then it takes me about 2 hours to fly out of there. But with the length of it being there I never really felt it. I also never felt crowded at all. \n\nEven though I'm a U.S. citizen, I will not be heading back. It just seems like a weird place. But they have some pretty cool restaurants on the property that I'll definitely go back to. 	0	1

I haven't run across authentic Hawaiian food in the Valley but tonight was my first time. I'm not from Hawaii and I had never eaten the dish I had for breakfast a few months back and was so excited to try it again. For the price, I was very disappointed in the food. Nothing came close to my first impression and as I stated, I'm not from Hawaii so it really doesn't matter if it's authentic or not. My mom's eggs were very soggy but it tasted very much like it came from a can. They also had a mushroom parmesan egg on the side which was nice and reminded me of the lunch special from Trader Joe's in general. I was not too impressed with my rice which was ok. My favorite parts were the fried tuna which came out hot and I would have really enjoyed some omelets and something to dip in. However, the taste was not very good and I really can't complain about that. I've had better at other Hawaii restaurants but it's a shame as this one is not worth the money. 	1	0
I love Cherry Blossom. Love it. That being said it's VERY pricey and I don't think I would ever go back. I actually bought a wet bar that I hang on the wall to dry my hair and it cost me $22.00 that I just can't afford any more. 	1	0
The RAMEN is excellent.  The owners are sweet and helpful but its hard to take the place seriously.  The service is good but nothing to write home about.

Impeccable service, but what else would you expect at the bottom of our scale?  The food is still spot on, and the atmosphere can be weird.  We ordered the House salad, fish sandwich, and our favorite menu item-the veggie plate.  The salad was pretty good, cooked perfectly and mixed well, but we went with the veggie plate because it has tofu and tomatoes in it.  It was also extremely delicious, though I would say the cheese, relish and sour cream were a little underwhelming.  The pickled radish and cucumber tossed into the veggie was edible, but not excellent.  The soup was equally tasty and brought out the bill.\n\nFor desserts, we ordered the chocolate cake and cherry almond crusted sfango cookies.  The cake was very good and decent, but not my favorite, so I was disappointed in the cookies.  We went with the Japanese sesame tofu and eggplant omelet on the left hand side for our entree.  Although I had the stuffed omelet, the meat was tough and no longer moist, which you get from stuffed mushrooms.  The omelet was very greasy and flavorless and the filling was unappealing.  No excuse for poor service.\n\nM	1	0
"I really don't even know where to start with this place... After moving to PA a few years back, I've been there enough times to know that it's definitely not the \""""best\"""" Irish pub in town.

In response to the response I received from the Museum of Contemporary Art about the quality of the exhibits, I am writing to point out some of the problems I have observed in the exhibits. As I have noted in previous reviews, the exhibits at the Museum of the Moving Image focus on so-called modern history (contemporary development and industrialization).  As such, I believe these exhibits present an <|startoftext|>  of historical items to which modern viewers are unlikely to have access.   I took advantage of my visit to the Museum of the Moving... to view the two new sculptures in my gallery.  In the Salon (Costume Exhibit) room, I took advantage of the extended movie time that the film was playing to watch actors dressed as Greco-Roman gods... while the painting, the goddess Charmante, is on view.  By extension, I saw the majority of the work of contemporary artists.  To be fair, I did see a couple of uncensored images that the museum itself would display to illustrate that the work on view was not for the faint of heart.  I would like to point out that I have paid for my admission through various means at other museums (equally as if I had purchased the exhibition).  \n\nThe two sculptures by Gilbert & Ulrich are excellent.

Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Bloomfield. For all of the action that's seen on the field, they mostly get hit on by the weaker yinzers. With that in mind, it's hard to rate a sports bar.\n\nWe've had phenomenal staff over the years, so if you're looking for a sports bar to hang out with friends in without actually spending $10, then Primanti Bros is the place. I was in town visiting with friends and I had the restaurant to myself, but at some point, if you've got yinzers, Primanti Bros will hit the spot. The bar staff isn't particularly friendly, but the two that I've worked with have always been pleasant and genuine. One day, they were in town visiting friends and I had the table to myself with a couple of other people, so I was ready to go with them. As we made our way to our seats, we noticed a couple of tables had more empty seats than where we were sitting. One of the staff quickly found a couple of different beer choices that were open, but as soon as we finished our beers, they asked us what we were drinking. We asked if we could just get our check, which we were forced to since there was no food available. Not grea	0	1

I'm in love. The festive d\u00e9cor charmed me the second I stepped inside. (and I think that's what they did: it made my day.)\n\nThe food was just....meh. The vegetables were tough and looked like they had been in a jar for the last year or two. It was a mix of seasonal vegetables with a huge blend of meat (literally...there was only one slice of meat and no veggies, some sort of beef/chicken/fish mash that tasted like a middle of nowhere: GARLIC YEAST!) and veggies with grated cheese. Gross. We usually order the vegan kabobs but decided on the chimichanga.\n\nBut hey, who wants that? So when they finally put out a (fake) vegan chicken chichanga, I knew we were in for a treat! They were the bomb. I mean a real bomb. There was such a rush when I arrived (wearing a cute black jean jacket), that I was driving up and down the block looking for the door. I think I ran out of time and had to take a nap before seeing the window.\n\nThe chicken was tender and delicious (and that has to be one of the reasons why we ordered it so early...it had t	1	0
My first review of China Chili was 4 stars. After having eaten here several times, I am giving it one more shot.  My beef and broccoli was hard and overcooked, my green beans were not tender and my chicken was missing many of the common ingredients.  That being said, the waitress was friendly and offered a sauce for my dish that I really enjoyed.  \n\nThere are two positive things to say about China Chili:  1) the service and 2) their Macaroni and Cheese.  I like the addition of fresh scallions to my dish.  It is cheesy and delicious.  The mac and cheese is excellent - thick and creamy.  I have not had the beef chili but would definitely consider this place for lunch or dinner.\n\nSide note:  I had a sandwich made of orange chunks in it, which I was shocked at.  They were included with the meal and the flavors blended really well with the orange.  You can certainly leave some out.\n\nSo, I give it one more try, at least it was good.  If not, I'm writing this review as a means of lesson-learned. 	0	1

I guess I am the only one who is not impressed by this chain.  I am from out of town and was told this location is big and will have excellent service.  I took my car there on my way back from New York with a better (and cheaper) oil change.  It took almost 10 min for my oil and spark plugs to be checked.  Everything looked fine and my car came back in under three minutes.  The service center was very, very friendly but was painfully slow.  I called the number I was given and to their credit, did get the person on the phone ahold of but not very quickly.  Then after waiting another 15 min for the same car, I called again and left a message.  If this place is really the new Saltillo location, I will be back. 	0	1
This place is just a few blocks down the street from where I live.  I think it's because of the name.  Good for college students.  Whenever I go there, I feel like I'm part of the larger campus.  The food is good.  The service is ok.  All in all, not something I'd go out of my way for again. 	1	0
This used to be my favorite, but lately the pulled pork sandwiches have turned me off.  It's still good, but in general they are doing a pretty poor job of making good food.  I've been going to Carolinas ever since they brought in a new chef and have been very impressed with him.  I didn't try to bring in his wife or kids because she only gives her husband the okay to work in the kitchen, but I would consider them to be the primary cooks.  They are also very busy, so I don't think I will ever go back to their place.\n\nMy husband is also a fan. 	0	1

They have been super busy the last few days and as a result I had to wait for 10-15 minutes to be able to speak to a human before they finally connected me. To top it off this is not the first time they messed up this run. The next time I will come here. And I will return to your IHOP location. Stay clear, IHOP! 	0	1
Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells them everywhere I go.  I've only been there for an hour and they seemed to have a full line up of certain foods.  The free Wi-Fi was nice.  I'd only go to the usual suspects in the real sandwich department if I had a lunch craving. 	0	1
The service and unique location make this a great hockey bar for families and early morning pick-up. The food is good, just average. If you like good burgers, you'll like this place. We've only been here once and that was in the first game of the season. 	1	0
I took in my phone because the charger wouldn't go with my laptop and was told that it would be $20. I had thought $10 would be the price but it was clear to me that the store had really skimped on the sides. I was also excited by the fact that most of the charging stations I saw had boxes on them. It seems like they might sell power strips for laptops and plug them in to charge my phone and other devices. 	1	0
They have closed this location.  To bad because I'll always eat here for any and all of my needs.  You can get food delivered, come in and then drop it off at the counter.  They have also sold their facility and are now just a very small restaurant with a few guys hanging out behind the counter.  Come here for coffee, cold beverages and don't hesitate to try their Thai tea or Apple bread. 	1	0
This was my first dining experience at Cafe Luna and I loved it. I had the traditional mole and eggs and it was well cooked and with very few pieces of sausage. I'd go back for the eggs and something different to try and I'll keep an eye out for some new options. Overall, very decent food, didn't leave me impressed, but other than that it wasn't bad. I'm definitely looking forward to trying another entree. 	0	1
I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would make sure they did not take off the Italian Special but I was so excited for dinner. We had the Groupon and it only got better from there. The butter chicken was fresh and the soups were yummy. If you have a coupon for Beto's, head over and sign up! I'm happy to give Beto's another chance. 	0	1
I won't even venture to guess why so many people love Moto - my friends and I all love it.  It's the Chicago Botanical Garden.  It was as if my friend decided to go all out and build a giant elevated version of the Great Gatsby house.  I honestly think they won't be able to finish it - the standards are higher than many museums and gardens in the country.  The market garden features a mixed group of native and non-native plants - from buffalo to bonsai to cacti.  We will be staying at Moto for an extended period. 	0	1
This place is really not that shabby at all. Not too upscale or fancy, but it's still an okay place to go to meet friends. If you need a casual place to grab a beer and a conversation, this is the place to go. 	1	0

A quiet bar out in Middleton, it's certainly not the cleanest bar I've been to, but on the other hand, I'm willing to trust the staff to handle the problem I have with they have the bar and all of the tables. We had a very good time here. I have enjoyed their grilled cheese with a hazelnut raisin. The drinks were strong and flavorful. No complaints there. \n\nMy dad and I just got back from a hibachi grill night here a few months ago. I had the red curry shumai - it was excellent. The chicken in chicken sauce was delicious and it had a slight sweet tang that combined perfectly with the rice. I had the Oktoberfest soup - good all around. \n\nI was disappointed by some of the slop I had ordered - the pork chop was too soggy, but that's just my personal taste. It was pretty well cooked though. \n\nI'll come back here when we're in the area. The bar is right near the beginning of the bar. I'd suggest going up to the bar to try some beers after a night of drinking in the big city. 	0	1
There really should be some kind of board that gives city planners any input on what's going on in the nightlife.  \n\nThe area is gorgeous, and there is nothing wrong with it.  This could be an area for an art center, but if you want a boutique hotel - give this a shot. 	0	1

"Ahhh..most of you are 100% right on.  Looking for a lil cab stand to take you to your next adventure.  The last place we had this was IHOP.  \n\nMaintaining that all we've done is drive from A to B and back.

Let me start off by premising the fact that I've eaten here several times.  I've been very happy with the food I've had there.  The selections are good and the customer service is always top notch.  There are a number of different take-out places in the area which you may visit as a guest or if you're a regular and make an appointment if you're there more than once a month.  Also, if you want to make the time to visit sometime on Sundays and the business is busy, you can find other places to sit outside in their pleasant outdoor seating area.  If you're looking for a great meal in downtown Champaign and want to try a new place, this is definitely the place to go. 	0	1

I've visited Molnar Service Center many times. My first visit was quite disappointing; I had the choice of two situations: 1) that they covered the roof of my car when I left it in the snow, or 2) that they didn't. They did the first, but only if I was renting the vehicle (which I wasn't). The second was most disappointing as I paid cash for them to park on my property, and then dropped the vehicle off the road. M'Laren saved me thousands of dollars. 	1	0
I don't really have to much to say about Sophie's. It has always been that way. I've been going there for about 5 years now, and I don't usually get the experiences I pay for, but for some reason I come back to Sophie's and I am happy and want to go again. \n\nMy favourite special is the Chai Hot Chocolate. If you don't like Chai Hot Chocolate, you might want to stick to the chocolate creme brulée because it tastes just as good. They have a great selection of pastries, cakes, cakes and breads. 	0	1
I was shocked to see all the negative reviews of this establishment. It's the good kind of place. The food is good. However, it's not in my top 5 places to eat in the Phoenix area. The wait staff is unprofessional. Ate there two separate times. I waited two hours for my two meals and then when I left I wasn't given my menus or payment. No explanation was given. I asked my server what was going on and he was unapologetic. Poor service, but I'll do it for the food. 	1	0
I really enjoyed Barrington's the only time I've visited. The location isn't bad, it's just that I'm not a big fan of divey bars. The service can be a bit clunky, and I've only been there once for a drink, but the food is excellent. I do recall one occasion where I was walking down with a date, and she suggested we stop here for dinner. They had great southern food, but our table did not go well. The bbq shrimp were crispy and the chicken was tender, but the breading was a little greasy and underwhelming. It's unfortunate that some places don't give a shit about quality food and service. I'm not a big drinker, so I expect much better from Barrington's. 	1	0

"The Armadillo Grill really surprised me. A dive bar in the ghetto with dark country music. The wait staff was pretty cool, and we ordered a limited beer list. Well, I guess I'll go for the beer list and just order my side of sides.\n\nThe Texas chowder was ok. It's pretty sour and just lacking the saltiness that you expect when making some kind of chowder. I did get one of their \""""Specials\"""" that were chili, texas chowder, some poppadom/ricotta, cheese, ranch, and jalapenos. All really delicious. The poppadoms weren't bad. The sauce on the chowder was pretty flavorful. There were quite a few options for toppings and a very diverse tomato soup.\n\nThe steak salad I ordered had the perfect amount of stuff, good flavor, and just a nice brown color. It's probably better for vegetarians. The Baja Roll (think Arizonian 'Naked Burrito') was also decent, but it was a little too salty and unappetizing to me. The shrimp tacos were pretty good, again for a basic stuffed taco. But I guess I'm probably more of a red foodie than an oregano guy.\n"	0	1
Visited this place with a friend. i used a entertainment ticket i bought from the website. we went in for the 8:30PM appetizer dinner. we had dinner for 2 as the dinner entree was $70.00 in price. i had the Cajun shrimp and were not overly impressed with it. a bit bland and under seasoned. at 7pm on a weekday i probably would have given this place 1 star but i was drinking and had to go to a different restaurant after this awful experience. 	1	0

"The best sandwich I've had in my life was one that belonged to my father.  It was the biggest and best that I've ever had.  The owner knew this and decided to provide it to me in one of his stupid ways.  The inside of the sandwich was chewy, cheesy, cheesy and chewy.  That's how I felt after eating it.  My dad did not get his sandwich.  When we told him that, he said, \""""Oh\"""" then turned to his son and said, \""""Do you know who gave you your sandwich?\""""\n\nSo my advice to you is to stop by Johnson & Wales.  The real deli should not bother with someone like this.  Then start spending more time in a store called TJ Maxx.  Then you'll notice the difference. "	1	0
I like Jamba Juice.\n\nI like this particular location as well.\n\nLike most eateries in the area, it's not really that great.  They aren't super clean, and what you do find in the drink or dish area can be quite lacking.  They have a good variety of wraps, drinks, desserts, sandwiches, etc, but if you're looking to try something different, they tend to run out very quickly.  The food here isn't bad, but it's not a great value either.  If you want to try a different kind of Italian food, I wouldn't bother with this place.\n\nThey also have a great wine bar (priced extremely reasonably). 	1	0
Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with parking. We had the House Special dish of Filet Mignon with cabbage, mushrooms, jalape\u00f1os, shallot, and cheese. It was amazing, I was so glad we got the same chef for both dishes.\n\nWe went to get take out on Monday afternoon and when we arrived it was almost completely empty. My wife asked for a table and we are all sitting inside the dining room, not in the large bar/lounge area. I ordered the Burrata Fettuccine Alfredo with mushrooms and prosciutto. When my plate arrived I was surprised to see the price was $53.77 (without tax). We paid (and never had a refund yet!) and that's about $10 less than the menu listed. The Fettuccine Alfredo was served with a baby spinach ricotta sauce, bread crumbs, honey, and a dash of red pepper flakes on top. I'm not sure if the sauce was the house brand or a local version but it was good. I tried the Alfredo without mushrooms and would have used them as a substitute (not sure what we chose to order).

The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do so successfully. The service is good and can be pretty fast.  There are lots of tables and more room than I would expect.  The area is often packed on Thursday nights with a whole lot of people.  Overall, an average diner with decent food.\n\nWe usually go for lunch but this past weekend we started going for dinner on Tuesday.  There were a couple of really good things that the order came out well cooked and the food was pretty good.  The sides can be a bit hard to choose from and are a definite added bonus.  We started with the macaroni salad which was very good.  I would expect more veggies on my salads if I didn't live by the vegetables.\n\nBut the best part of the meal were the potatoes and their cream of mushroom sauce.  It's really quite good and even good if you are trying something new.  The soup of the day is usually doled out on a plate and had a great balance between the flavor of the sauce and the mushrooms.  The servers are generally good and tend to serve you something if you ask for a side and not take away from your meal.  The service can be a bit slow so bring your appetite and eat it quick	0	1
I took my 1989 Mercedes into Martin's yesterday to get my headlights adjusted.  I was told that the fit was going to be 7 weeks, they had to take my car to another place and they were going to charge me $300 for a labor and work.  That $300 was a deterrent to come back to the dealership and give them another look.  \n\nAfter calling them back to confirm that the light came back the next day, I still had a 7 week inspection to complete.  I found out on the way to the shop that the alignment was incorrect and was going to be billed for it.  For some reason I am charged additional charge for not having an additional look.  They called back and explained that their computer doesn't trust their computer and the other shop uses computer software to do the alignments and charges a fee for that.\n\nThey told me that they were going to continue to speak to their technician and get him to correct the alignment.  After about 45 minutes, the technician called me and said that they were going to call the police and bring charges against me.  After that I went home and did not take the car in.  After about 10 minutes of arguing with the technician, I turned the car over to another mechanic.  He fixed the alignment an	1	0
Great rib eye fillet (mushrooms make it!) OK service (took 20 mins from start to finish) The sole reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 3 is because of their staff. What a bunch of hotties.

Jerk chicken pizza was excellent. Bomber was good but the wings sucked the worst of all. The sauce was best of all. I went because the lunch crowd was there so I could try the wings. I really wanted to like this place but the wings just weren't for me. I would not eat here again. 	1	0

I love Harley's, but my liver hates it. Booze and joy escapes my liver and I am left feeling like a fat version of The Rocky Horror Show in the middle of downtown Phoenix. \n\nI'm from Long Beach, California and I thought I would be a nice fellow at the end of an exceedingly miserable week, where I brought my girlfriend the absolute weirdest piece of manicure she has ever seen and now I can't eat a cookie. (Somebody call a police department!) In lieu of a proper bath, I took a break from running to the elevator to calmly describe my situation to a salon owner who happened to be located in the same complex as my kitchen. The owner of the salon was kind enough to offer me the spare parts for my manicure, which the one night didn't seem to be an issue. \n\nNow, I have never had a manicure I didn't like. When I told her the alternative plan of getting what I wanted, she only thought it was amusing to me, but was honest enough to say she was going to make a big deal about it.

In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything over there in many years.  And they just decided to move the event down one level in the future. \n\nI actually really like it. It's fun to watch a bunch of people in a dimly lit room, chatting and laughing and moving. And there's just something about that cheap feeling of excitement...just....relaxing? I don't know...I kind of like it.   I never hear any obnoxious stuff, and I really do like the big pool table.  Good thing too.  The stage is spacious and sometimes full of fun little games and activities that sometimes hit the spot.  I can't say that I enjoy all of the competitors. The band scene here is pretty over-rated...maybe they do it because it's cheap or that they don't want to compete in a bunch of like-minded groups. But it's always a nice gathering and there are always cool-looking people on stage. \n\nYou can sit at the bar or the bar next to the stage. And as you're waiting to hear the band (some bands are several songs in length), the staff there are super friendly. \n\nThe free popcorn and water pitchers are nice too. 	0	1
Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for this horrible establishment. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I will never eat at this place again. \n\nI love Spago's. It's like an Italian familiy. Slight confusion over the difference. Anyway, its close to the Arcadia Mall and just a short walk from my house so it made my drive that much easier. I usually stay in between my two jobs in the C-U shopping center area and I like to walk. The place is clean and the food is good. What can I say, pizza is good. \n\nThey have daily specials but their bread is actually that of a store bought pizza crust. These prices make me sad. \n\nI was glad when my sister-in-law was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. I lost a good amount of weight and even my sister-in-law is happy now.

This shop is everything that a pipe collector could want. This shop makes sure that you have the best possible service. The service is prompt and the prices are high. Most of the guys that work here are above average in their skills. They are nice and when the time comes for you to get anything done they make sure to give you their honest opinion. This shop also makes sure that all of their requirements are met. I do not recommend this shop to anyone. 	0	1
We have eaten here before and its one of my favorite BBQ joints in all of Phoenix. It is very low key and is hit or miss on the food. Sometimes it is perfect, sometimes it is just decent. It was our last night here. The first time we went it was a buffet with fried chicken, waffle fries and candied yams. That was excellent!! My husband had the ribeye and he said it was the best he has ever had.\n\nWe enjoyed the home made mac n cheese and the Carolina Chocolate Chip Cupcake was very tasty. It was our only craving for dinner after talking it over with our server and judging from other reviews, not a very good one. We ate our meal as planned and thought we would probably have to be a little nicer next time.\n\nThen again, who knows. If the owner and the kitchen put the kitchen back in business it would be one of my favorites. I wouldn't mind a grand prix anymore. \n\nThey have good pool tables, parking, and you can get a table right off the street in the yard.

Ok so lets be honest. The hotel is not fancy. It looks nothing like the attention to detail that it does in other larger hotel chains and the rooms are out of date. The bathroom is tiny and the bathroom area is small. This makes the hotel very small, and very dated. The best hotel world wide would have a bathtub with a shower, with super comfortable pillows with pillows in it. My eyes have been spoiled by the chains and this hotel is no more. What kept me staying at the Hyatt was the food. The staff was very nice and very accommodating. In the short time we were there we saw about 10 people coming and going through the rooms. The kids (4) all went out shopping and while this doesn't sound like much it is really a way better atmosphere then some of the other stores. \nI think they have an EBT card, which is the main draw. If you need to pay, just ring the door bell. They are pretty easy to remember the receipt for. 	1	0

Bought a bike there on my second time in the store since moving from Texas.  The drive from Valparaiso to Atlanta took the dog of a day but I was happy to find a place that had good prices and good selection.  I had a great experience first time in.  They helped me find a bike for my father's work group so we could ride together and try it out.  We had a friend bring in his wife's bike to be in the shop before we rode it.  The shop was full of people who could not get around to stopping for us.  I appreciated that they didn't try to put us on hold while they finished what they were doing.  The store was stocked with plenty of bikes and accessories and when we told them the new bike would cost $30.00 a piece they informed us that they had more to stock.  However, I told them I just wanted to try it and still maintain the value I was brought.  The reason was that when I told the shop about my father's work group, they told me to use the dollar amount on the bike.  I came back with no money on the bike for my work group's needs and no reason given to me why the price would be so high on the dollar.  The shop said they woul	0	1
I am always searching for good chicken fried steak. This place fills that void. I have been here 3 times and have had the food consistently good. I would suggest visiting on a weekend and grab a table as it is very busy. It is hard to get a table when there is a big crowd and lots of cars. If you get there early, you will get a seat immediately. They do have a restaurant next door and can accommodate a larger group. I do have a few complaints however. Their hoagies are small, are not great and are soggy. Their fried chicken is far from flavorful. Not sure how they keep it together. Also their bun is always soggy, and I just never finish my meals. Only thing they can't change is their to-go containers are large, and it is so annoying when the meat goes in the to-go and then when I return it is very old. If you are looking for a great fried chicken place, take a look elsewhere. My friends and I get it when we go to Dean. 	1	0
This one is really hard. \n\nBased on other Yelp reviews, I figured this place was going to be pretty good. I've been to several sushi places and this was by far the best I've ever had. It was nice and warm and had a nice amount of yummy flavors. The service was attentive and friendly. But, like most sushi places, the quality just wasn't there for me. The tempura rolls were so light and fluffy, but I could tell that I was only eating half of what I was asked to. I did like the sauce on the roll because it seemed like it was really good... however, it didn't really add much to the flavors in my dish. It was a really fun experience and definitely worth trying if you're looking for good sushi. 	0	1
For the inside dining experience, McDonald's beats Burger King, hands down. Not only that, but in my opinion, I think the food at McDonald's is much better. \n\nI took my car there for an oil change and tire rotation and it was a near walk in as it is tucked away next to the Denny's next door.  They don't need my coupon or anything to turn it into a great experience. \n\nThe staff is always so nice and accommodating. Most people I know have never had a problem with service at the front desk. \n\nYou have options for lunch as well. You can order from their bakery menu or take it off the list. I got the french toast cake with bananas and bacon and my dad got the omelet breakfast sandwich.  The omelet itself was a bit greasy and a bit off, but it was really really good. You get at least a dozen pancakes and they always have something to drink.  \n\nI have no idea where this place is located, but it's a great place to find a sit down restaurant for a quick bite and drink. 	0	1
No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this place Shadyside Grille.  That's like saying that I should always wear a wedding band.  Seriously, it's the opposite.\n\nIt's not really a dining experience, and I'm sure it's for everyone to decide what they like best about what they eat, but if you're coming here for traditional comfort food, then you want to watch people who really know their stuff not get a good meal because they forgot to count the card in the correct order.  No, I'll get around to that.\n\nMy husband and I went on a Sunday afternoon around 11 and were there with a few of my friends.  We ordered all kinds of delicious stuff from the menu:  a burger (pretty great, I think; I wasn't a fan), a rib eye (lame), a filet mignon (not great), a steak sandwich (my standards are low) and a filet mignon and a soup.  We had a wonderful time, and I can't wait to go back.  But because I'm still hungry after that meal, I'll probably be looking for a different restaurant to eat at. 	0	1
This place doesn't come close to living up to the hype...but they do have a really nice happy hour and you can get $5 DUCKS in the bargain.  Also, their beer is actually better than some other places I've been.  I like DUCKS a lot though. 	0	1
Last time I was here probably five or six years ago...don't think I've been back in over a year.  \n\nThe food is delicious, the atmosphere is sketchy, and the wait staff is pretty awful.  The place is like a dive but it is pricey and gets crowded at times.  \n\nIf you're really hungry check out El Paisano at 16th and Camelback.  That's where I used to go when I was younger. 	1	0
Great place to spend 3 or 4 hours. Took a group on Sunday night. The food was amazing, but the service was just plain nasty. One person had to flag down a server to ask for a salad. She didn't even finish the salad. The other two got served up with the salads and hardly ate them, then went back to check on their drinks. They sat empty for 15 minutes then came back and were told they couldn't drink their orders and we had to call them later. Seems like a place that should be fun, but not so much. Oh, they also don't take credit cards. \n\nOne of the best places for Mexican food in town. 	1	0
I am here as we speak.  I've been coming here since 2001 and with the change in ownership, it's no longer the best BBQ in town.  The BBQ that is supposed to be there is now very marginal.  In fact, it's more of a texture based style.  Overall, they've lost a step up from that they were when we used to come here for happy hour and special occasions.  The decor used to be great.  It was a great bar area that seated about 5-6 people.  The food was always good, though.  My favorite was the Jamba Juice Burrito and I've had many of them over the years.  If I was to make a comparison between this location and last I'd say it's the same, and last for BBQ.  The food is what really blew it down to the low-burn, stinky-straw color.  Don't even think of ordering BBQ because you'll be disappointed! 	0	1
I've never written an on-line review of any doctor or hospital until today.  I have been taking my Infant and Preschool Medications to Dr. Byers since my last visit.  He is very patient and takes his time with you.  I was so disappointed when I left the nursery with severe vaginal bleeding, significant abdominal pain, and a loud screaming infant.  Upon returning home, I called Dr. Byers and spoke to him for an hour.   I wanted him to diagnose and order the Implant/Toe Splitter and the Receive Bacterial Pedialyte, Both of which have taken 3 months to complete.  Then he delivered and it was a complete C-section.  This isn't going to happen again to me, but the other doctors suggest getting it from your regular doctor. 	1	0
I would agree that the food and pastries here are pretty darn good. I also like the ambiance of the place. I'd definitely go back. 	0	1
Time to chime in. It sucks that a place could go downhill like this. I like the location, The couches, and the vibe. You can't go wrong with the layout, right?  \n\nSo I went to Down Under to have a drink with my friends, sat at the bar and I sat there for over 20 min to speak with the bartender... Who only knew my name from my last name and couldn't remember if I had the name, I mean seriously? Didn't have the name and I said I do and he said I got the waters as my first ever. Lol. \n\nSo I gave her my waters and got one of the scotch and said let me tell you what our drink looked like... Horrible.\n\nWaitress (I think) was friendly enough, she seemed to know a lot of the regulars and I didn't get that vibe at all.\n\nSo back to the new chef. I couldn't decide if I was excited for him to do a hip/hip & traditional and I was disappointed that he did it in such a terrible way and looked so creeped out by it, or if I was disappointed that his food was totally underwhelming to me. \n\nI'm so disappointed.

"I like the design of this place. It has a nice trendy ambiance. The food is pretty good. I get the \""""meat and potatoes\"""" which come with a bowl of salad. I've been here on several occasions and I'm not a big fan of meat and potatoes, mostly because they come with a fairly heavy packet of potato chips. So if you don't get into that format, your meal can be pretty bland. However, I've had the takoyaki which comes with a side of rice, and the Japanese beef which is a chopped up burger patty. This is delicious. They also have a variety of vegetarian options but these tend to be so common in the US that it's kinda annoying to keep reading this place's reviews. "	0	1
Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza with buffalo sauce is my favorite. We always get the fish sandwich. The crust was a little too chewy for my taste. I'd come back for the pizza. The mozzarella pizza is my fave. My wife's is hers but our taste buds are different. My wife loves the flourless chocolate chip cookie crust and her husband loves the salmon calzone. However, I always want to try the fish! 	0	1
Not a large cultural center, but it does have several movies showing there and the bar is big enough to seat a large group. They did a huge renovation of the theater in the summer. They also have an extensive Music Hall with many unique old time fiddle, old time piano, and reworked machines that show old and new covers of popular songs. $6 Wednesdays/$9 Fridays. \n\nThe food is okay, just not my favorite. I was not impressed by the desserts. 	1	0
Venus Beach breakfast burro was DELISH! Very healthy and low carb options for breakfast. The pickles were good and the tortilla had great consistency. My friend had the brisket and my response was nope, not great. But it was just ok. I have to say that the staff is attentive and friendly and it is super convenient to my office, which is actually right across the street from this place. \n\nBe aware, there is a 20% gratuity on every entr\u00e9e and the price is so expensive that I will definitely be avoiding this place. I can honestly say that I am very disappointed in this place and especially if you get the Burro, I would suggest getting something else as they give you both sides for free! 	1	0
Ok, so it was kind of funny. I have a cat named Ramsey and he was not very happy in his new home. I wanted him to like it. He literally left the door open all day. We called on my birthday and they said they would make a special appointment for him. 	1	0
I went to Christos as my 2nd Restaurant Week stop. I liked my experience at Christos a lot. The service was good, so good, that I am never gonna go back to a restaurant that is so slow to put things together. I took 2 people, and had one person come in ahead of us and never said anything to us. When the hostess brought us food after our meal, she told us that I had made my reservation by my name in the review! I didn't even bother to look it up in the review, I just felt it was silly to bother me with the incorrect information because I didn't really think we were going to stay longer than our reservation. They were not so bad, but neither were their customers. The attitude is usually pretty good at the Denny's chain. 	1	0
Don't get me wrong, The hotel was beautiful and the location downtown was beautiful, but the food was just flat. I had the steak tartare for my entree that was just ok, no flavor, no flavor. The soup was served and then it was on to the dessert. The only redeeming factor was the compote (that was amazing) on top of the steak tartare. It was very refreshing and I would definitely try the steak tartare again. 	1	0
Food from the motherland is a weakness of mine so it pains me to say that I only gave 2 stars. I had the duck sandwich, French onion soup, shrimp and grits, chocolate cake, some fruit and mocha. I got the French onion soup with smoked duck and the mashed potatoes were heaven.  Oh my goodness, they are made from scratch. When my sister tried it she said it was the best thing she's ever had. It's soo good. Maybe that explains my 2 star score.\n\nThere was a really sour taste in my mouth and for a french onion soup that had about 4 small slices of duck meat it might have been something.  I couldnt eat half of it but my sister shared it with me. It's a shame too since it's a really good place and great for sharing with your friends, family, and colleagues. 	1	0
Pretty good Thai, though slightly overrated. Hit and miss, with some classics but others that are just hot and gooey. I also tried my first fried rice. It wasn't very good, but it was pretty bad. The drinks were cheap, so I don't see why not. 	1	0
I have been wanting to try this place for a while...but since I am an older student, I have had to take my thesis to another school.  Once I did return, I had a hard time finding the place to eat.  I like the view (even if I have trouble standing there), and the atmosphere is laid back and very laid back.  However, it would be easy to become bored and over priced...\n\nIf you are a serious eat at here vegetarian, I would suggest going to the one in Vegas and you can easily see where all the food is.  If you are just going for a cheap meal you might want to consider the ones in the University area. 	1	0
Great breakfast area and managers happy hour.  \n\nBig down side though - due to the small size of the store, it is very crowded when the restaurant is open.  If you're in the area, make sure you're there when it's open.  The place was busy on a Friday afternoon. 	0	1
"You would just think with a name like Mr. Submarine that everything would be great.  We went on a Tuesday night to see what kind of movie we could get so we could watch a movie in a nice setting.  We thought we had found a great show.  After all, the marquee said \""""Submarine\"""".  But after a few minutes we decided we weren't ready to watch the movie and just went home to see what we could find. \n\nWe waited for a while and nothing.  We called and found out that while we weren't able to see the movie, they did put on a show for us that evening.  That was pretty cool!\n\nAround 8pm we decided to try on some suits.  I was surprised because these suits are all about the body (nothing to do with the movie) but I was glad we did because they were really comfortable.  They are super inexpensive and they fit me quite well.  I guess it wasn't the most comfortable but you get what you pay for.\n\nWe ended up having a fun time watching the movie with our movie friends and not being totally ripped off.  We went back to \""""Mr. Submarine\"""" the next night and looked for the guy again.  An"	0	1
"Good looking talent and really good food specials will always keep my guests coming back.  There was a pretty big line and I thought there was going to be a wait.  However, they had a whole section for bruschetta.  I had a Spicy tomato marinara pasta with sausage and ricotta and it was really good!  My meal also included french fries and this was what they came with.  Still, not that great.  The sartorial treasures are tucked away in a large building.  I would love to go back there and enjoy one of the \""""classic\"""" spots that are open on Sundays. "	0	1
Waitress good, bartender slow... Could have a few more drinks with drinks... Ok, so I've been to other places and it's true... I've had much better bartenders. So, when I go to this place, I'm happy. They have a very fun atmosphere and it's a welcoming space for small groups. So if you're looking to play cards or just hang out with friends, this is the place. 	0	1

"So I have to admit we were a bit confused about Chipotle when we first went in.  We had been to this restaurant quite a few times and were expecting a great experience.  But the food was nothing to write home about.  The service is just okay and the food is bland.  Not great, no must try.  I don't really want to rave about this place so I won't.  My boyfriend and I both got the \""""2 and up steak\"""".  I had the beef and it was well cooked and was not terribly greasy.  The beef that comes with it was dry and tough.  The lettuce had good flavor but it was not the best I've ever had.  There were also side dishes we tried.  Tandoori Chicken was by far the best.  \n\nThe price of this place is absolutely absurd.  You can get much better Indian food in Phoenix or New York or San Diego.  This is simply not Indian food.  You can get much better food out of any Indian restaurant.  And if you like great Indian food (or even Chinese food), you're better off trying something in San Diego or Phoenix. "	1	0
Great experience in previous visit in Orlando so tried this week here and get the Grilled Artichoke oiled and steamed up medium. Great service and great dinner. A side of lemon zest was good as well. My husband LOVED the Pesto Alfredo and the Parmesan Cheese dip that he received as well. Never go here again but will definitely recommend it to others. 	0	1
I give this a 4.5. The service was okay, thank god because my meal was just about over 1/2 full. I had the tuna fajitas. The tuna was good and the chips were good. The fried plantains were bad. They were so soggy that I had to scrape them off with my hands. When you think about it, they're really tiny fries and would have been better served with a side of salsa. My food was light and had a good flavor but I guess that's to be expected. I will say that the big thing about this restaurant is that it's a Taco Bell and all you can eat. There's probably nothing else like it in town. 	1	0
Newer store design, relatively clean and quiet store during my visit...although they do have a list of 30's business cards in the gift shop, which is really nice...all the stores I visit are very clean and quiet. 	0	1
I was excited to get a group of 5 great friends together for dinner.  The service was great.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun.  The only negative I can say is that the wine list was too small.  I had a little alcohol on me and the waiter tried to rush us.  My husband had the quiche with goat cheese and cranberry sauce.  It was quite good.  Unfortunately, we had to wait for our 3 other dinner companions to arrive.  The service was so good, I feel like the food didn't deserve this try.  I ordered the ginger sorbet and my husband ordered the crab bisque.  The ginger sorbet was very good and tasted quite fresh.  The crab bisque was not very good, though it looked promising.  The music that plays during the meal does not seem to make a great impression on the guests.  We got there about 10:15 pm and were seated by 10:25.  \n\nThe first thing that surprised me was the wine list.  The list for the meals was $17.80 (over $14 less than the menu price of $22) and our table had two bottles each of three wines.  My husband's cabernet Sauvignon Blanc and my win	0	1
"Was on my way to see a movie, thinking I could redeem myself by getting a free plate of food. I'm not a fan of the cheap entrees. Our server was absolutely spot on in her responses to our questions. She almost put her head in her hands when she first came to greet us and asked if I wanted anything else. My order was \""""prepared grilled chicken\"""" with green olives, coleslaw, fried pickles, and their  extra spicy mango juice salad. I had the garlic slaw, it was pretty good, just not amazing. And the chicken. OMG. What a meal. We were surprised that there wasn't any garlic in it, and to be honest, didn't care for it. One big disappointment was the lemon-curd gravy which was an afterthought. I tried it, but again, it was nothing to brag about. To really know what you're getting into, order something different. \n\nMy friends have ordered from here before, and they were happy with the food and the service. In the end, we'll keep going just to experience the movie we love so much. "	0	1

"Review #83 and nothing surprising to report here. \n\nParking is easy enough on 32nd St. and after a quick walk to the bar I noticed a nice little private lot behind the bar and the restaurant.  You can park on the private lot and walk to the front of the restaurant.  I parked on 32nd St, walked down and got there.  On my way down 32nd St I noticed the kitchen where the food was cooked.  I took a few steps, as I approached the grill the sign that said \""""SAFETY BOARD: NEVER LEFT BEHIND THE WATER\"""" hit me.  I dropped to my knees and grabbed the fire extinguisher, I did not make eye contact with anyone but it hit me hard.  But, the kitchen door remained closed, I then asked the waitress what the fire hazard was.  She said, \""""I think you will see what is going on,\"""" I asked again, \""""Will you turn it on\"""" and the waitress said she would.  My first thought was, this is not going to be a great place to work I thought as we were driving through the parking lot, it would be pretty scary.

Good wholesome BBQ, but they were out of collard greens and mashed potatoes.  This was not the case on the night of the BBQ dinners, which was very sad because I had heard that they were so good.  This might be one of the few places to go for BBQ in the city without having to eat out, so if you like BBQ, go there. 	1	0
Spot check on this place = now closed. I live right across the street and have been going there for years. The next time I visit, I will go to PF Changs or Denny's. I know this place has good food, but I will be back in time for an off night. There are too many great restaurants in the area. 	0	1
"Ok, I'm updating my review. I come here far too often now for some things to be 100% true. I used to get great ribs, if you will. Good cheese, excellent service. But the past few times I've come here, it's all but gone. My biggest complaint? Prices. Everything now has a 99 cent boneless rib price and there are only two booths with cheese and sauce. Why you ask? Because last time I had a pair of baby-pads brought in... $1.20 for a \""""well done\"""" cut that was fried and cold. What? Yep, they'll charge you like that if you bring something you think will be good, and it's even worse now that they've switched to 99 cent pizza and more cheese!\n\nThey have a great happy hour too which I love. The prices on beer and food has gone up like crazy, but you're better off forgoing wine and beer than not to! There's a bigger selection now and the really great stuff (like the #18) is now only $2.99. But on their side of the counter you'll pay for 'that' drink that is now 8.99 for a pint. This makes it so much more difficult to sample something unique. And with these changes in price"	1	0
La Pomponnee, I wanted to like you.  I really did.  You have a great traditional Italian food spot.  I had the lasagna with mozzarella and prosciutto and it was AMAZING.  The pizza is super basic, the mozzarella is just the RIGHT size and there's a ton of cheese.  I think you're right up my alley.  However, your prices are way too high.  I should have known you were one of those places where you had the least amount of meat in the dish.  I definitely would come back for the pizza, pasta, salad and dessert.  The decor is ok but just nothing special.  I can't say I'll ever come back for dinner. 	0	1
"Today was a group lunch for a friend who is trying to kick her fat ass in her fight for health.  I had never tried a Giant Eagle before.  I said it was too large.  He said he didn't know.  I said, if you don't know, maybe you shouldn't be a Giant Eagle employee.  I told him that he doesn't know how to treat my pet.  It was impossible to listen to this guy.   I asked how could anyone pay that much for such a bad product.  He said, \""""Big Bertha.\""""  He gave me his card and that was that.  While this place is better than a lot of other Giant Eagle locations in town, I didn't care at all for the people working here.  I will not be back to Giant Eagle for lunch.  "	1	0

Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern charm doesn't mean it's your place.  We had the boar sandwich - the pork was fine, nothing special, but the spicy rub I didn't care for.  It was dark and they were out of chips.  I enjoyed the crab cakes on a basket with rice.  I'm sure they were delicious once they cooled off a bit.  The service was awful, our server was slow, and a few times our server screwed up.  The beer on tap was way too strong, and after we complained they gave us only a watered down root beer to take home.  This place rocks - just don't expect the 'it's just like plantation' crap. 	0	1
So you're with a bunch of people who like chicken wings...what do you do? You come up with a place that can cook chicken wings for you. It seems like a cool idea at first, but as you get more involved you start to get your $8 back on it.\n\nJust because a place isn't bad doesn't mean it doesn't deserve praise. At least this place tries.\n\nI finally got in contact with The T.O., and basically told them I was leaving. I will make another trip to an Ace out there in the near future, hopefully with some fresh wings. 	0	1

I recently got married, and during our engagement, my fiance called ahead and mentioned that he had his daughter and she had been there a week earlier. We were really excited because it was our first time out, and we wanted to start off by making sure we were in the best location. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived, but then my husband tried to talk me into going somewhere closer to our hotel (not far from the restaurant where our party was staying) - I just was not happy about that option. I could see how the location is great for an already-established restaurant - but with the concept of catering to events and couples, it was much more convenient for us to move to the new location. I think we enjoyed our stay there - it was kind of romantic, but a lot less luxurious than if we were just making a reservation or were visiting just for dinner. \n\nAs I mentioned before, we got out of there a bit earlier than expected - for our first visit, I thought it would be a good idea to try to get a reservation, but we were not really able to get one. We had two little girls who wanted to go out for a nice dinner, and so we decided to take advantage of the meal that was supposed to be given out by another restaurant. We ordered a lunch men	1	0
OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, disparaging emails. I get it. I get it. I get it. \n\nI am seriously just out of there. I have no idea where to start. When I started my quest, I expected more. I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh, albeit unpleasant-to-read and unpolished breadsticks on their menu. The baked beans I received were reminiscent of mine from out of state.\n\nThe salads were all very good. I could not place them in a word but they seemed well prepared. The other salads were served at another table and I never saw them either. They would have been unappetizing on their own. This week's selection were really wonderful.\n\nMy favorites include the most recent $3.95 seafood fajitas, the Ajo (a fried tortilla dish), the chicken picado and the fajitas with honey chocolate sauce.\n\nHowever, after our last two visits, I am most definitely falling in love with the new yet still outstanding Carolina's. The food was good. The staff was super friendly. I got to go on one of their corporate parties where I get to take home two entrees for myself and two for my wife and I. An	0	1
Driving down 7th, I got reallllllly excited seeing a little chain eatery up there.  The inside is pretty cool, and the atmosphere makes for a great view.  The food was so...meh.  It was pretty forgettable, but I would not go back for that.\n\nWith all the tables around us, we were able to share a seat easily.  We ordered the turkey sandwich, and my sandwich was excellent.  It was full of vegetables and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were the second-cheapest I have had on a burger.  A bit on the greasy side, but so so.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the bacon cheeseburger.  It was pretty tasty.  It's a burger topped with bacon, and it's soooooooooooooooooo good.  The only negative I have was that the bun was a bit dry.  That is really annoying.  Anyways, the burger was soooooo tasty.  I don't think I will be returning, at least for the next time I'm in this area. 	0	1
It's cathartic to give this sorry organization 1 star.\n\nNote: this review applies only to the Friday night events.  They can do all on Saturday nights, if you know when they are.  In fact, I've never seen them do any less.  And in the last 10 years, not a soul has complained about it! 	0	1
I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the George. It's annoying when you go to a red light to let one go, that same auto-negates on you...and that often times makes you want to walk away. But you're not alone. I have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances who ride here all the time and each time they have an accident or two with George and there's always a knee-jerk reaction about the friendly old white guy hollering and yelling... You gotta give it to them.\n\nWhat was that I hear about George using up to 15% off his rides on Sundays? My friend took his beloved Cadillac around town on a Sunday and the same thing happened to George's riding gang from time to time (last time it was a nail salon!). So, I don't know why anyone would ever visit this place, especially on a nice Sunday. But if you're looking for a corner o' petrol with some pleasantness and a friendly face, George's Yellow Cab is a must-try. 	0	1
This is a five star McDonalds so to speak. There's really nothing wrong with that. I don't know what's good or bad about this place. I just don't like that they have 6 women's bathrooms in their drive thru. There's only 3 in a place with 8 male bathroom. Makes me mad that they are offering each gender a separate one. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying you shouldn't do that but take a dump in the urinal in a different gender stall. Anyway the only thing I really like about this place is the fact that there's plenty of parking. It's conveniently located so you don't have to drive all the way down south to get to a good place. 	0	1

"This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star based solely on their service.  The quality of their food is very high and while the atmosphere is often pretty grungy, it is almost always very consistent.  The cook (who I assume is the manager) will usually take the time to explain things in English, while others will ask questions.  When they do ask questions, they do so with confidence and with a smile and the answers are always correct. \n\nThe tacos are the best part of the meal, as they are not over stuffed and definitely give you more than the taco shell says you should.  The chips and salsa are excellent as well, they are a must.  My girlfriends favorite dish is the fish taco.  My only complaint is the pricing - especially when it's on the low side for a lunch restaurant.  I'd go to Whole Foods in San Diego to find better fish tacos.\n\nSo why 2 stars, even though I love this place?  I think the location is a good fit, as it is in a building with it's own parking lot and is pretty easy to navigate.  It is actually rather great in that it has all the cozy old school charm of a Mexican restaurant, while still maintaining it's \""""traditional\"""" attitud"	0	1
"So...my fianc\u00e9  and I road tripped our way to France via SF and met up with an old friend at Diner in the Stone (I'll get to that later).  My friend had two car issues and our town had no towable parking.  I said we'd look at a shuttle that worked but like a mile away from Diner.  So we started walking north on Crosby and ran into Tony and his wife at Restaurant that Wasn't (it's a great restaurant!).  Apparently this is the only place to take the half hour between 2:15 and 4:30 p.m., all day long.  When we stopped and ordered our waters we found we could not have been more pleased.  My fianc's beer had been poured - and my to-go boxes sat empty.  The food was ok - the salad was way too much noodle, but it was quick and that was about it.  I won't be going back.  I'd rather go home and pretend I did.

At first I didn't like this place. I tried a couple dishes from their menu and it was less than stellar. The service was decent but the food was just average at best.

After eating mind (and ass) blowing Mexican food at numerous restaurants throughout Phoenix and Glendale, I felt I had to give this place a chance. You know, I usually just go for the chips and salsa and all the good stuff. However, when I got a friend (who was from out of town) who just said she loved their tortillas, I knew we had found something special. For those of you who have never been there, their tortillas are made with a special blend of meat from the Chihuahuan and Mexicana cattle. I can say with certainty that this is not a buffalo chicken tortilla or any other kind of tortilla type stuff. As an honest to god, I could buy buffalo chicken tortillas right now at my local Giant Eagle for a very reasonable price (compare to the $2 for frozen in California). The meat of this particular Chihuahua has been ground into a powder that has a flavor akin to cheese (as opposed to regular chicken) and this blend is then used to make their tortillas. \n\nIn other words, if you like your tortillas moist, thick and salty (as opposed to soggy) this is the place for you. And I mean that in the best way possible. \n\nThis place is located o	0	1
"My experience definitely was not favorable, but it was not entirely undeserved.  I will say that the staff was great, and so were the dogs.  In addition, the customer service was spot-on.  The \""""small world\"""" that the service offers (for it is priced out of my budget) was wonderful.  \n\nHowever, my coworker was having to deal with an issue that required immediate attention.  He took the dog, and after consulting with multiple specialists, he was helped.  The service was prompt, and professional.  My overall review for the Vet Plus Group is pretty standard. "	0	1
i'm all for recycling / re-using/sustainability but a lot of these carts seem like they were made in the 60's. that's not cool at all. and it's ridiculous to use plastic a lot in a store to sort through all of that stuff. and the more you put on the cart, the more trash you're going to throw away. i would love to see this department recycle them all. they need it. 	1	0
Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh...what are you getting at?\n\nI get it....a chain with a million competitors.  At this point, I've never really been impressed with any of them.\n\nMy favs: Bianco Spaghetti (I mean really good - better than Qdoba's Spinach Tacos with pepper chipotle sauce) and Pasta al Bruschetta (tastes like smokehouse chicken sans chicken, washes out the chicken, and then stuffs the shrimp in cheese...spicy but is cheesy so get used to it).\n\nNeedless to say, I will be back to try any Bianco Special (except for their Pasta al Bruschetta)...their Tiramisu is also good. 	0	1
When my girlfriend and I moved from NY we had no clue where to go to get our hair cut.  We had been working here and thought it was the closest place.  In fact, I think we actually went up to see the owner/barber.  At first, I felt my boyfriend was being a douche bag for asking.  When we came back later that night to discuss and explain what we had heard about the staff, he didn't feel the need to apologize.  He was very nice and we just left.  That is the type of friendly service that I look for when I'm planning on trying out a place. 	1	0

This review is about the FOOD only! I'm in town for Memorial Day weekend and was told that they were closed and that I would have to go to Jiffy Lube. Not the case.

This is a good place if you like loud music and obnoxious servers. I like the live music. The food is good. For large groups it's overpriced but that's because the server's are always doing well. We've never had any issues.\n\nThe problem I've had with this place is that they always put people in their kitchen over there so close to us that we can hear them - it's annoying. There's not much that you can do about this. Plus, the food is always on the small side. It's not exactly like ordering from the food court, although that's really where it was. I think if they tried I'd come back, but I don't think there's much better than two meals for two bucks. 	0	1

"One of the few places in the area that will actually customize your belt.  The woman who does that is very nice.  Plus, their production is top notch.  Got a belt for a guy on my bike that was supposed to have a less-than-perfect fit.  Paid $150 for it, no problems.  Got a belt for my wife's fiance that just needed some belt alignment.  She wasn't so thrilled with the fit, but a good sales associate will rectify the problem.  I did the same thing and it was totally worth it.  The guy I rode with went back on and did a complete fit himself (two sizes down and $50 more, he said).  Now he has all of his riding gear installed.  I was quoted around $400, but I only spent $240, so they were really on top of the price we were quoted.  One word of warning--a \""""Do Not Bend\"""" sign will point you in the direction of a workman.  No back of the car.  No people in the parking lot.  No biggie, no problem.

I used this place for a while, but now having worked downtown for years, I would never use it again. I had a cockroach in my hair in the mornings, and my friend got shat on at work. We called for a replacement. The new girl put out a call, asking if anyone knew how to remove it. The manager on duty took my friend's wig out and got one for her. The place was crowded, so he let them do it, and when she came home, I could see her shitting in the bathroom. I had no idea how she did it, and complained to the manager. He took the wig out for replacement and gave me a check.  The place was clean when I went in. I went back there later to pay, and then realized how dirty the place was. I couldn't go back because of the shits, and went back to work. 	1	0

Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.\n\nSalads are average sized - nothing special.  Lettuce soup is runny.  Salad is filled with simple ingredients - water, onions, tomato, mayo, olives, sour cream, tomato relish, and cheese.\n\nMy dining companion had a Caesar salad with Italian dressing.  And how could you forget that dressing?  It was huge!  After ordering, we both asked for the dressing, and she kindly brought back the little cup the dressing was in.  That was a great gesture.  Now I will never, ever need to bring home the dressing.  This dressing alone cost over $10.\n\nYou may decide to splurge on your favorite sandwich - I got a giardiniera sub, and that was just ok.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a French dip, go for it.  I went there for that last time and the corn bread was delicious.  If you have any time when you can't eat, go for a quick bite to eat.  And if you don't get home until dinner, take the little tummy-chugging mini sub you packed with your sandwich to the grocery store. 	1	0

This is where i call home... The honeycomb hideout!!! My daughter loves going here and has been going there for over 2 years. I went here in October and we had already made a reservation. As we were waiting for our table the server asked us if we had a party and if we would like dessert. Then she looked at us as if we were some odd animals (oh god)... When my daughter looked at her mom and said yes she was wearing a white dress. We are not supposed to see white but I had to look. We were right there and the server realized it right away. It was a HUGE party that night and all of the tables were occupied... My daughter told the server and the hostess that she hated looking at white... But she does... After the server and the hostess acted like it was not their problem she pointed to the guest who was in white. I wanted to see her because I know she has little ones, their outfits are always dirty, but the server just told her that... If it is their problem just let me know... and this was with a friend and my daughter was not there. After that we sat down with the server and the hostess. The server made her apology and proceeded to take care of all of the other guests by cutting back the bill to help with the broke	1	0

We visited this Applebee's location last night.  We were greeted promptly by the hostess.  She was quite sweet and courteous and I thought that was the highlight of the evening.  She was very friendly and took great care of us.  The only thing that left me feeling a bit disappointed was that we were seated near the bar area, which would have been nice since we did not want to wait for a table on our way back to the hotel.   I've eaten at restaurants that are more open and I know that not everyone will be as accommodating to guests as this one. 	0	1
In a bit of an indifferent mood before ending up at Yelp for work, I called on a Monday morning to make a reservation for dinner. I had my doubts because I had heard of some really good Asian places and had seen them all in pictures. I was also worried about the amount of $$ it would cost and the safety and location of the place. However, I decided that if it was going to cost so much, it better be worth it. We were immediately greeted and seated promptly. Unfortunately, the little thing that I don't like about this place is that it looks like an old Chinese place... something like what you see on the Food Network or HGTV. As I wasn't a big fan of any authentic Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, I wanted my meal to be a good representation of authentic Chinese. I also told the waitress at the table we were going to try the hibachi. She gave me the informed opinion that as a younger chef, you try the actual hibachi. \n\nI was pretty excited about this place. On a Monday morning, and it was quite late, I could have gotten a late breakfast without eating in the restaurant. However, the sound of the ramen being microwaved is seriously gross. Not to mention that if you aren't used to Asian food that wel	1	0

You know I've been eating Chris's pizza for about ten years now and has been with you for over 10 years and you have been THE BEST! You have been there forever and it has been such a long time that it's hard to remember the last time I was not satisfied and you have had pizza for ages and if I ever stop by your restaurant, I know you will never disappoint me again. So if you're like me and remember the past and are thinking of trying a new pizza restaurant, DON'T! This place is like a red flag to you! Why are they open when it's the busiest time of year on the weekends? Your waitstaff gets stressed out and you could be in a lot of trouble without being picked up by the manager to ensure your order is as it should be (which I had to do on multiple occasions, even though I would not request that, because that is just lazy and makes me feel like an outcast!). And if you do order, don't order anything but pizza. The only reason I went back in the past and my food was not as good was because I only ordered the pizza the night before (late last night and was hoping for a better pizza but they give you pizza for free), and I wanted the same pizza every day since I am not usually a crazy eate	0	1
I have been going to Benihana's back when it was called Yelp Diner.  I would always get the green tea curd appetizer, which is some kind of green tea dip.  It is always good.  If you want a truly delish chile burrito, this is definitely not your place.\n\nIf you are looking for real chile sauce, then this will not work for you.  Most of the other chile place's  are pretty darn good too.\n\nI would not give this place a one star if possible.  The service is horrendous.  They take forever to get my food (sometimes 30 minutes).  You have to just ask for your chips and salsa as soon as you walk in the door.  I mean seriously??  I can't just ask for salsa, just tell me when?  I have asked for that salsa before, but they never give it. 	0	1
We'd been meaning to try this restaurant for years so we booked our reservations for the 8:30 PM dinner.  It was actually pretty good and it was about half off the regular price of $80.  No big deal.  We sat at the long bar that connected to the big projector screen where they talk the afternoon news and when we were ready to order, one of the servers asked if we wanted any teas as well.  We were super excited to, and went ahead and grabbed the teas.  I think the barista even had a straw in her hand and was acting the naughty roguish girl.  The tea was delicious - maybe 5 different types of teas, with different flavors depending on how much water you drink.  At that point, the plates looked lovely and the food was much more enjoyable than the evening before.  I ordered a saucer of the orange lemonade and said that it was a nice dessert.  When I tried the orange juice, it was rancid.  It was nice that the service person was very pleasant and that I could understand her concern.  The drinks were exactly what we ordered.  The food was fine, but by that point it was starting to get cold.  When I got home and opened up the package, there was water al	0	1

"Subway calls their line folks \""""sandwich artists.\""""  If those words rang any bells, it was because I had just heard about it.  Having been on the search for great subs, I was heading in the direction of Home Depot and having real fun as I called.\n\nThe first Subway guy told me he was working for Mike's Pub, it was too early for Subway on 16th Street, so he had to cut back a bit.  If that's a sign of Subway's resurgence, I think I'm in for a treat.  I had Mike's sandwich for lunch.  I dug in and didn't think about the odds of subs landing at Home Depot, but I was so happy I did because they came out SO fast.  Subway's yellow, berry bun holds up to the treatment.  Mike's is great for those who are sensitive to the texture of the sandwich.  If you're between Wal-Mart and Home Depot, you'll be glad you found Mike's... I like the cold and crunchy side.  I could've gone on and on about my lunch, but I won't be coming back anytime soon.  You'll need a road trip to eat Subway and discover this little gem. "	1	0
The nickel and dime comment from Paul is spot on. He forgot about us. The food was cold, but I know that's because their great smokey booty sandwiches are so damn good. It's like they made an effort to bring the menu and something to it. Now I know I shouldn't complain about that, but there are some places in Phoenix that really need it more. \n\nOh, and the wings... I asked for 3 and they only have 1. Absolutely ridiculous and one of the best wings in town. The meal was not as entertaining as some other locations, but the deserts were awesome. \n\nGo for the specials on Sunday (at 9:00) and then once everyone has ordered their appetizer or dinner they'll be gone!\n\nOh, and the amount of pleasantries the owner offered (for a restaurant) I thought was a little cheap.

"As much as I love the food here, I'm sad to write this review.  I used to go here with my mom and sister almost every weekend.  It has been a favorite of mine for a while.  We really loved it.  It's a real hole in the wall, tucked away from everything that I love (school, exercise, etc.).  It has cute decor and has been used by many good people and decent people over the years.  It is a nice dive with cute murals.

I stumbled across this quaint bookstore today, and as I left home with my heart in my mouth, I wanted to let you all know how I felt about it. \n\nI came in to pick up my items for an upcoming business trip, and the place was packed. I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down and opened up the books. It was quite the adventure finding new places to read. First of all, there were a ton of great choices. I was going to compare this bookstore to a few other options, but I am far more of a collector and collector's kind of person, so I decided to stick with one of the wide ranges of titles I am going to have.\n\nReading outside of one store is nearly impossible in Arizona, so the one offered here seems like a good place to start. \n\nThe stock of books I was looking for was nice and large. They had at least a dozen shelves of books for me to peruse. I ended up browsing some of the books and finding that the staff had a great sense of humor.

"Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words \""""Mexican Food\"""" in the name has to be some kind of bastardized version of Anadarko. However, this place is still good. The chicken enchiladas are my go-to when I want a flavorful enchilada, but there are also horchata and soda and chips available for those who aren't comfortable with the idea of fried things and just want to go for a small bite without ever chewing the thing. The rice and beans are just okay. I would prefer the grits for the tortilla soup. Some people seem to love the beef enchiladas but I don't.  \n\nSadly, this place doesn't offer much variety on the menu, and some dishes aren't that good.

Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering program here at Spring Training.  The office had just recently changed in the management from a Jewish family to a predominantly Christian one.  When I first moved in I was trying to become a volunteer and was not told about this change.  Luckily I happened to see a volunteer session being held by a woman named Jenny.  Jenny did an excellent job on taking my information and connecting me to various Jewish communities around the country, and then assisting me during the month of July with the application process.  She was also willing to participate in my community outreach, volunteering with local Community Centers in my area to provide educational presentations at Christian worship services.  I was even offered a complimentary membership at one of the churches that hosted their event in the new facility and Jenny even came to the house to greet my child at the door.  \nI believe it is important to keep in mind that they do an excellent job on each volunteer's behalf, so it is important to consult with the person who is handling your situation.  I would suggest that you first try out all of the volunteers on your list and then choose only the ones that you feel will be the best fit for your needs and needs of your child.

I am writing this after my horrible Omni experience because I realized just how little I can count on at this store.  I needed body work done and was told they had a staff of two.  The woman who took my order just did not know what to do with my size 5-14 so she placed it in the box with the appropriate item and gave me a smile knowing it would be done in time.  (Yes I said 2... to make it even more perfect).  We waited for the person to come to the table to ask us which item she should bring out and I asked the attendant which size she should place it in and he informed me they could do it for the other size.  So basically he expected me to ask him for help when I went to the register because if I said I had a 6 or 7, he expected me to be willing to do what it would take to get it done.  To be honest with you, it was well over $100 to get it done and I was already kind of shocked to not know the exact size to get it done for.  (And I didn't even think about paying the extra $8 or $9 for the extra machine).  Still, I decided to go ahead and do it anyway because they were really nice about it and the	1	0
Totally agree with Steve L comments in his prior review,especially about lunchtime parking.  The service was great and the food was good.

I came here once and ordered pho, and I was pretty unhappy with my experience.  I didn't want to pay for the twice as much food I would get elsewhere, and this was my first time here.  The service was nice, but I had a really bad experience with the pho.  They didn't seem to care about what I wanted to order, so instead of paying more (like $50, for two bowls of pho) I just got a small bowl with some dipping sauce, and that was that.  I feel like the pho was cooked really well, but the seasoning was bad.  The soup that came with it tasted bad too.  It was a different kind of noodles than you'd find at most restaurants.  That's really a bummer because they should be hand-spun noodles (I'm talking about the right kind, with lots of water).  I'm sure it was just a personal preference, but it was too much salt in the broth.  It was a bit too salty and I just couldn't eat it.  I think we're all going to have our own taste buds when we go out to eat.  I think we should just choose what we like, which is what we did. 	1	0
Meh is right. My whole family is in love with this restaurant and had me for dinner on a recent Saturday night. I had never tried the dish but was looking forward to it.  My wife and I started out with the corn bread. It was just a little tough on the inside, especially when bread was splashed all over the plate.  But at least it wasn't gross. The lamb shank was also very tender and I loved the slightly tangy sauce!\n\nService was even better. They were very helpful and friendly.  The waitress was attentive and played the tab. Everything was presented quickly and was served on fresh bread that looked wonderful. I would definitely go back, but not this restaurant. 	0	1

How have I never been here before?  How have I NEVER spent $20 on a seat and not been treated so much?  Where in the world are the TSA screeners at?  How was that even possible?  How did I pay for the only pass through from here to the Continental grand terminal that they have here in Pittsburgh?  I've never seen so many attendants working there.  And how did I get through security?  The line was overstuffed, but hey, maybe that's their job.\n\nSo that's the upside.  But I will never, EVER go back to this airport.  There are plenty of nice hotels (and some that I had in college and hated).  There are super cheap restaurants (while I'm a 2 hour commuter).  The last time I was here was a week ago, and the airport is a mile from my house.  If you want to buy a ticket here, you better have it in hand.  Oh, but their food and drinks are reasonable.

I've gone here a few times to see bands. It's got decent seating and I've only been there for the entire show. I always leave with the feeling that I wasn't that impressed, but that's because I'm not used to big groups that are so much more demanding than the average show crowd. \n\nAt least they do take credit cards. My friend never buys alcohol there and she never drinks there. I always buy it there. The wait staff is a little strange too. Usually they have a group of other people that have something to do, so it takes them long to come to attention. \n\nWhen I've come here they've sold out of some of the most popular songs on their website for $20 a pop. \n\nI have never experienced poor service, but I do like that there is no guarantee that you will get a good seat. 	0	1

I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. The buffalo chicken sandwich is some of the worst I have ever had. A plain grilled chicken breast is great, but the breading and toppings on it are bad. It was cold, dry, and the taste was terrible. I have eaten there multiple times and the bread and toppings were not good at all. My fiance ordered the combo meal and said it was his favorite meal. That's all that can be said. We ordered the salads and the General Tso's chicken. The salads were not as fresh as other locations and the chicken was stale. We didn't even eat the chicken. My fiance ordered the pork chow mein. The sauce was stale and everything else had had enough of it. The pork in the dish tasted burnt and the egg was not hard at all. We decided to pay the extra 2.99 for the drinks which we did with no problems. 	1	0
I am tempted to write a bad review so less people won't come in.  but with the regular regular wait for a table being at least 4 hours, there is no reason to stay any longer.

Luckily I don't mind Coke....  I have been here many times when they have Rottweiler's on special.  The prices have been nice.  The bathroom is very tiny.  The thing that makes this place stand out is the cashier.  I'm sure it's a gimmick of theirs but it is nice to see that they are serious about customer service. 	0	1
Not too bad. It's a upscale sports bar.  Food is mediocre at best.  The environment is very loud.  The service was ok, but I am not sure if I want to sit at a table for long periods of time with a crazy amount of other people.  It's a tad confusing when there are a large group of people around.  Very disappointing. 	1	0
I've had a copy of Jingle All The Way since 2012 when it first came out.  It's been on their records as long as I can remember.  Their early records were my jam.  They had some great songs on there, like O.A.S.T.I., everyone remembers those.\n\nThey added a lot of diversity to their selections over the years.  While not to my tastes I had fun going on some good Sunday-night walks around the Manor to get to all of the things I'd love to do.  It wasn't always the best, sometimes it was great and sometimes it was terrible.  Sometimes you'd think that they would be more interested in plugging some acid house songs from back in the day, but the outro credits kept changing, and I could see why:  people kept giving up, let's not forget that.\n\nNow it's hard to really compare Jingle All The Way to what it was before.  It's a little different and you have to choose.  It's a great record and I'm sure it has its place in some peoples hearts, but for me it has a lot of competition.  And despite the fact that I don't like the band too much anymore, I still hear that whole 	0	1

It is rare that I post any reviews anywhere, but this restaurant needs to be shut down. The food was really great, it was cooked to perfection, and the drinks were good. I didn't go for the atmosphere, but I think the dinner was more to do with the service. 	0	1
You should check out PlayNetwork.com.  Great customer service with quick turnaround times.  You can even connect to your phone on the showroom floor!  \n\nThe only catch?

"Don't waste your time: Try Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Hannys, Zizzaro or Esopus.  They all have great food.  And there are the usual suspects: salami, provolone, mozzarella, prosciutto, provolone, fennel and swiss.  All delicious.  I mean real Italian food in a college town?  :) \n\nWith all that said, I feel sorry for these three guys on the review, for they clearly all dislike their jobs.  They are all so careerist and all have failed to appreciate this space.  I suppose it's because they all come from \""""alternative\"""" ethnic living--I have to say the upper Midwest is better kept under wraps than any place you go in a more metropolitan neighborhood like Pittsburgh.  And I am willing to bet Cibo/Bianco/Doric is the least diverse of the three.  \n\nThere are lots of quality, innovative and interesting pizza places around town, and this is my least favorite.  I am always happy to see an ethnic owned business improve in value as it continues to succeed and grow.  We're doing a lot better at being ethnic in Pittsburgh. "	0	1
This place came HIGHLY recommended by a friend of mine, who flew into Charlotte on a business trip.  We're no members, so my friend wanted to make his reservation for the weekend, so we made an appointment for 2 p.m. on a Monday, and then decided to make a reservation for 12 p.m. The restaurant was packed, but they didn't close till 6 p.m. So we had to wait until 1 a.m. to be seated, which meant it wasn't that busy.  I've had less bad experiences with this restaurant, because they've been able to compensate for people being late to other parts of the restaurant when they order the same thing, and I think that's valuable to people who order from local restaurants in larger cities.\n\nService was very good, and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  It's got a very Mediterranean feel, so it's very fitting for the restaurant, which takes its name from the Greek word for island, meaning one sitting on a high mountain.  It's the sort of place you could go to for dinner and then go back to eat and enjoy it later with the kids.\n\nThe menu is limited to just sandwiches, salads, and entrees, and they seem to specialize in very specific dishes, like Gree	0	1
I'm lost for words. I continue to go here because it seems like it's the only place I can get my hair done. So far, so good. The stylist is nice, but I do get what I pay for. That's good, but the next time I need a new shampoo/conditioner/drying powder/etc., I'll come back to Circle K. 	0	1
Um....Nope! \nThis place is in DESPERATE need of John Taffer. If anyone knew how to make a good desert-style martini, it would be Taffer. It's barely knowable from the outside, and you just want to leave. However, if you go, I highly recommend it.\n\nHere's a tip for these guys - LGO doesn't take reservations - like 5 minutes before your server starts to take your drink order. You can order in to-go (cold or warmed up) and they'll do that for you. If you go early, though, you can order a boxed drink (they'll come out in 5 minutes). Also, don't tell them that you just want a warm bottled drink - they'll ask if you'd like a glass, to which you MUST agree.  \n\nOk, first thing, go to the front, right down the street from the Hard Rock Cafe. There is an ATM right there that you can just park and use (just park on the left side of the building, and walk a few feet up the street to the cashier). As you walk in, ask if there is any type of discount (I think they will give you a coupon for the bottle, not the full bar). Then ask what they have on tap. At firs	0	1
Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging for mercy at this deli, I could not give this place a better rating.\n\nThe sandwich is so damn good that I can't even begin to express how badly I wanted to return.  We ordered the option to dip it in tomato sauce, which was incredibly sour and was probably very disappointing to even dip it in.  It left a really bad taste in my mouth.  But the following:\n\nFresh mozzarella in a very nice and fresh tomato sauce, and accompanied by grilled onions and provolone slices.  Even though I'm a fan of bacon butts, I had to add a lot of salt and garlic in order to taste it.  \n\nBread was tasty - very good, with a great crispiness.  Served with a tangy, tomato/ketchup sauce, it was better than what I expected but still good.\n\nThe problem was in my opinion, the portion:  The average order came to about 6g, and I believe it was about 8g when I returned with my sandwich.  It was cold and the bread was very thin and chewy.  My regular order came to about 9g and came with an extra olive or olive oi	0	1

I'll start off by saying that I've been to Danny's before...Last night I had a pie that was too sweet to eat. You'd think with the name being Danny's the expectations are high. I'll start off by saying that I've been to Danny's before...Last night I had a pie that was too sweet to eat. You'd think with the name being Danny's the expectations are high. But you get my point...I wasn't put off at all!\n\nDanny's is a little classic. It's an old school place. Like I said it's a little old school. There's just something about the atmosphere of this place that makes you want to go in. I'm not kidding when I say you're basically sitting there thinking to yourself, I wonder why anyone would go to a place like this...I wonder why someone would have been in a hurry to go out with a date there...\n\nAnyway, with all of that out of the way let's talk about the food.

Whenever I check out a new place, be it a restaurant or coffee shop, I look for the best service. The place I usually visit is coffee shop/restaurant, so I thought I would give it a try. The wait staff was great, the food was okay, and the vibe was intimate and romantic. However, there was very little service and they did not greet us when we walked in the door. I believe they were busy and their shift was over, but not welcoming. Maybe we were the only customers, but I would have felt more comfortable staying at Lux or Collin's. Also, they should name it after the Moon in Arizona... \n\nOn a side note, I never ate there before and never would if I lived closer. But, the Italian Beef Benedict was so good, I had to share! 	0	1
A charming room, great atmosphere\n\nI have noticed the small bistro area upstairs has recently been updated. I've been here for dinner and it has improved. This is a great hotel to stay at. We like the location and have found it to be a perfect value.\n\nThe service is attentive and pleasant. The most recent guest was very gracious. I'll update this review shortly with our experience at the Hotel Monticello. 	0	1
Ah, the Spanish Latte.  I did a little reconvenience shopping this past Saturday.  It's one of those secret places you almost can't find in the touristy area of PGH.  You would think that their Latte (which is not a latte at all) would taste like frozen soda.  Unfortunately, not.  I got the Espresso Italiano (who doesn't know Espresso), and you really can't get more Italian than that!  They taste like espresso.  The cold brew I had was very strong.  I recommend it over any other hot brew, IMO.  \n\nThey do carry packaged varieties and some decaf, and the hot brew (Spanish Modelo) was good.  \n\nCigars were alright.  I like the oldschool Cherry Liqueur.  I'd go to Bed Bath and Beyond or Rokerij for that one! 	1	0
"Okay, a little disclaimer for bias.  Having known the owners since childhood, I can only speak for this bar.  I do own two dine-in tables so I can speak to their service, but that being said, I've had better.\n\nMy previous experience with Shogun was wonderful.  I started going here with my family about 10 years ago for dinners we'd help plan.  We had a slightly sketchy clientele and had to ask, \""""Waitress...do you like me?  Or are you just going to play nice to everyone around you?\""""  We'd always received very friendly, friendly service from Shogun and our dinner had always been a great way to spend money.  \n\nHowever, last week my bestie took her aunt and I to Shogun.  Now this is where things really went down hill.\n\nWhile my date and I were sitting down, she casually mentioned that she was starting a relationship in a couple months (with a man she met online).  The waitress, who was still perky and smiling, asked us if we wanted to order \""""warm meat\"""" on the menu, which they would cook up on our table.  It was extremely clear to us that Shogun wasn't going to serve this item o"	1	0
The basics: nice atmosphere and good food, but a bit outdated (especially if you want bbq). I don't know if this place is old. I don't know if they have good food, but I think it's close to me and I like the food. When I go, though, it's always a shock that they don't have more meat on the menu - some days I'm here with my mom, other days I'm with the kids, and a few days they're stuffed and I just want to go home. I'm just not a fan. \n\nIf I lived closer to here, I'd like to try someplace else on their menu. 	0	1

So - started working right down the road from MOTO, so whenever we needed the service, we called in.  We were used to buying a couple of months in advance, and having the choice of the type of service we wanted.  The guy we used, at least at that time, treated us well and got the job done on time.\n\nAs far as getting what you order, my wife and I went through a couple of different places.   I asked John for suggestions and he said to look for the person you want to have the cake and candle orders taken.   Same thing was done with the cake and candle orders.  So they say.        Well - look for their type of service you want.    The Chef performed some work and we were back at your place and ready to take the orders.\n\nMy wife and I went with the pepper cake (cakes are different sizes) and a pepper candle.   Both were good, but the pepper cake was the better.   I had the recipe for the pepper cake and it came out pretty tasty.   We did not order the -flavored custard or even lemonade.    But the big egg rolls were ok.   My wife had th	1	0
I will start off by saying the actual wine and cheese selections were awesome. I had the Mahi Mahi and I had the Marinara which was great. \n\nI went with a group of 7 and all of us had really good food, I'm quite certain I have eaten many decent meals at the restaurant but this was just a really great meal. \n\nThe wine list was nothing to write home about, if you have never had a soprano sized bottle from any of the top 500 sommeliers in the world, it will not impress you. I think the bartender had 5 small bottles and one very large but what impressed me was that it was not a very large bottle in quantity. \n\nTo start off with, it is a restaurant where everyone goes to have a good time and once the server brings it to the table, the guest will not leave until the server brings it back to the table with you. By the time the server returns a bottle to your table, the original member of the group (when the table is ready) has already gone and had a nice drink or two. \n\nThat being said, for a small wine of $25, which is not bad, I really would not mind paying $13 to have a bottle of wine b	0	1
I'm a bonafide OC gal where sushi joints are like PreFlight fun and this place is like PreFlight rules. I just don't understand the hype. I've eaten their food since I was a little kid and have never been disappointed. I always get the gyoza or soba, pork shrimps and a bowl of soup. My only complaint is that I almost always end up with three pieces of terrible soggy gumbo for my food. I don't know how anyone can stomach that, it's delish. 	0	1
"The first time I came to 007 I walked in, got seated at the bar, and could have done without the \""""red carpet\"""" around the bar. Since that time I have frequented the bar on several occasions and have always had a good time, not to mention the service. Unfortunately, after moving to the Phoenix area I could not get my hair cut there anymore due to health reasons. They gave me a great haircut there, but I had to go back, and she insisted on switching me to a different stylist. I will never go there again for that reason. As I say, sorry to tell you this, but I think that now if you want an amazing haircut, I would suggest going to Shadyside instead. "	1	0
The real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen, just so you understand. This place is not like that. It's about as close to gyrostyle as you can get. I actually like it a lot. The bread is super thin and the portions are large, but you still have to go hungry. \n\nThey used to have great food and staff but they shut down this past summer and they decided to add the Pittsburgh Cheese Co to the mix. A place to get really trendy and cheaply made. I don't get it. I'm also a big cheese fan so I'm not sure I trust this place with my massive quantities of cheese. \n\nThey do have a good ambience and some booths with cups and straws for hot beverages. I'll be back just for their Pittsburgh Cheesecake. 	0	1
Unique location inside Chase Field where the local Arizona Diamondbacks play home games.  It is an amazing design and not your average clubroom bar.  The bar is adequate and the seats are comfortable.  This is not a cool looking bar, but that is a good thing in my book.  You'll sit at a chair or flat board with a larger armrest and cover yourself with the drink you're drinking.  The drinks can be pricier than other places in the area but worth it because of the bar.  I like the low lighting and the feel of the club.  The rockin salsa is amazing and there is no place like it in AZ.  Come on over, I know you'll love this place. 	0	1
"One word for my late: Water.  Not really sure what prompted me to check this place out.  We had an hour long delay due to bad weather.  Had to play Texas Hold 'Em.

While visiting my brother and family in Phoenix and after seeing AJ's review, I made the drive to enjoy the recent events in Pittsburgh and the smell of great food coming from the kitchen. It was a huge mistake to only check out AJ's review. I was so disappointed with the food, especially the scrambled eggs. I almost threw up as I was eating them. The bacon grease over ran my tongue and left me with a nasty throat ache. I never want to be in that kitchen again... or in the whole neighborhood! 	1	0
I got take out from here today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the food.  The food was good, I had the Beef and Broccoli with Macaroni and Cheese, so yum.  It was really light and yummy, and the filet was good.  Overall, there isn't a whole lot of stuff on the menu that you can't customize with hot sauce and bread to make it your own.  My big complaint is that the sashimi portion is pricey.  I want to go for the regular portion of the price so I don't get sashimi filler.  Even if it was an extra $10 extra I'd still go for the sashimi. 	0	1
"Now I really try to like this place , especially when its ice cream.  The food is good and the price is good for good value.  It's location is like being in college and I'm too lazy to walk and walk a bit.  I like that they have a sign posted for parking so you can easily park your car or go on to your next destination without waiting in line.  \n\nOne aspect of this place is that I am a big fan of their desserts.  I get me a variety of different flavors and I can save the sheer effort of trying all the cakes and cookies and cheese like they have at other Charlotte bakeries and buy from them.\n\nThat aside the egg drop souffle is amazing and the cookies.  Now before you say, they are all SOOOOOOO expensive you can say, \""""I got this for $5.99 but it was made to order\"""" and start your shopping.  And I actually did buy this for a bit more than that.\n\nThis place is not for everyone  they can work on making the quality better but its not worth the money you'll have to spend to try them. "	0	1
If you look at other reviews you will see that this airport has really good food. I've been there for one long layover (5 hours) and it didn't look too bad. The things I really liked were the Panera and Jack in the Box. They did have a long standing rule about offering hot and cold sandwiches but that didn't deter me from trying them since they had some hot ones as well. I took my little plane and my sleep was great!\n\nHad the donut I came to work and it was really good, especially for breakfast. In the morning, although I didn't stop for coffee, I did drop some eggs on my way out.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice layover for me and a very enjoyable airport experience. 	0	1
Good prices, better coffee.  The food never looks good and tastes terrible.  Lately, it's been so bad I had to eat the chips and salsa and dip to get over it.

Do I dare make this comparison?  \n\nBest sandwiches here are the San Juan.  Dump it and fry it for lunch (so good). 	1	0
I wish I lived closer, I know it is not near PHX but I would still come here on the weekend.  The atmosphere is like when you go to Vegas.  \n\nI'm not going to lie, it is pretty dim.  I'm used to at least 75+ degrees outside in the summer so it was nice.  At night I thought maybe they don't open so late as to not offer drinks.  We had an event with a lot of celebrities and musicians and the place was barely going.  It was around 4:45 and people were already getting up.  We sat down and got some food and music started up.  We had to get a little bit of service since we had people sitting at tables all around us.  I was shocked how poorly people were doing.  I sat down, gave my order and the waitress didn't say a word to me.  She just kept eating, walked away and didn't even try to stop by.  But once we were out of there we made it to our car.

I came here for the first time Saturday to watch the Luminaries & had a great time.  It's a really small venue so I didn't get to try all the bands, but I was happy to see that they had many other acts and that the sound was always good.\n\nWhen I was done with my show I was super excited to see how everyone did.  There were always people from the audience staying to entertain the next person.   I went next door for the 7:00 show, and the next thing I know, 10 people show up and I'm the only one left in the area.  Not my fault...just bad timing.  I was up for the final curtain call but then realized that there were still 10 people outside!\n\nWhen the last person left, there were a couple guys from the back crowd and a couple guys that come from the front that were asking if the doors opened.  First of all, who would want to open doors in a show and then sit there and then leave?  If you have an old lady with you, this is ridiculous.

Best Buy is a necessary evil because I don't know where else to buy things.  It's the only place I can get stuff online, so I need to trust it.  I always run out of things but at least I know I'll have it.\n\nThe only downfall is they'll close.  Once they get around to putting up back parts it becomes quite annoying.  They must have an undying contempt for customers.  \n\nI'd stick with Costco and go to Zappos.

Popular neighborhood chinese food joint with ample buffet. Started with rotisserie chicken. Spicy or nothing. Both were really good. Rice noodles and vegetable steamed / boiled and some garlic and ginger as an appetizer. My wife had egg drop soup. It's the perfect dinner for you. Eggs not boiled or sprout sprouts with egg drop. Just sweet & sour soup broth with chicken. Next was pancake w/ potato pancakes. Everything was good. If you are in the mood for sushi u can't go wrong. This is a place for the high rollers & everything else. They are regulars. \n\nAnother great food place with dessert - Golden Buddha. Be sure to get the orange sherbet ice cream with banana cream cheese in your drinks. If that is what you crave (i.e. you really love to drink orange sherbet) then you are good to go. They have only one chair but they are nice enough to bring them to your table at all times. The patio is just a bit too cold for the low temperatures. 	0	1
"Had lunch there today. Waited for about 5 minutes for my waiter to come by. I told him I would be right with my husband so I didn't want to worry about it.

He looked up and I started asking him if it was him and he said \""""Well he was talking to another waiter.\"""" Ok, fine. I called the manager, and when she came back she was very nice and said that the manager did see me. Ok, thanks for your help.\n\nMy husband was trying to figure out why my salad came out so green, and I had that kind of reaction because it looked like some sort of noodle soup, and my peas tasted really good, but I had never eaten a vegetable vegetable before.\n\nNow I will tell everyone to keep their expectations high for a restaurant when it comes to their food!

I have been here for eyebrow waxing. My eyebrows were waxed really dark and shined a deep red. I only had an appointment so I went in and they recommended the complete removal. They did a little bit of prep work and made it look like I was still growing my eyebrows. I waited 2 weeks for it. When I went in for the removal it took 4 weeks before they came out to say they would be there on Monday. When I called and told them, I had talked to Jessica and was told that they were just overbooked. I was confused and confused about where to go. Finally I asked if they could come and give me an appointment for Monday and they said that I had to call them myself the following Monday and they could make it happen. There is a Walgreen's down the road and I will definitely come to this location. 	0	1
"Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So far everything they did was very good. There's 4 or 5 high level professionals working in this office. It seems as if they are super busy. But it's their job. There's people at the back of the office who are all rocking their trainers with big puffy breasts and high heels. If you're like me then you really want to look good. I just spent 20 minutes getting my hair cut in the the back and none of my hair was cut at all, not one little row of really high maintenance men sitting there doing their normal work while I stood there talking to them. All in all there are very nice people there, and the whole office itself feels clean and organized. The worst part was when I went to the garage where my mom is going to be having my nails done in 5 days. I saw a man putting up a hair dryer on the floor and told the receptionist that I wanted to come to this location. She just shrugged and said, \""""Oh.

this place is unbelievable.  i have been a member for quite some time and have been up for the service and food.  i remember the food from about 4 years ago.  the steaks are always done well and have been hot and juicy.  the service is quick and the food arrives quickly.  i have never been disappointed.  the difference between what they eat today and what they used to order is just massive.  the servers are very friendly and will be more than willing to accommodate your individual needs.  the service is only average for a small steakhouse but when you are trying to juggle family and work and need a break from mediocrity it's all worth it.  one small complaint however is that they give you way too much sauce.  a 3 lb steak usually comes with 1/2 the sauce as a member so you would be better off with about 1/3 of a serving.  again, a simple salad for your salad is better, but as a bonus you get to use a smaller portion of the steaks than a member.  the change in menu would have been better for good food and service but everything else was still good.   this place is full of potential but not just yet. 	0	1
I ate here a while back and walked away full. The buffalo chicken sandwich was good, but it was too expensive. I also ordered their coleslaw. It wasn't very good, but it was still good.

Because I have never had one of the \""""big menu\"""" lunch options (entrees, entrees and sides) in AZ and living down the road (much closer to Phoenix) I must say that they sucked.  You know it just hurts to work out there.  It's just not all that good.  And honestly, in the past I have been to Biltmore a few times and loved it.  But  honestly, this time was just bad.  The cornbread was terrible.  It was the most cold cornbread ever.  And my favorite dish was the goat cheese dip, a vegetable salad which was not at all what I expected at a restaurant with the names.  I was expecting more of a salad.  They did also miss a sweet onion roll that they had just the other day.  And seriously, in a college town like Phoenix, I expect a lot from a place.  When I say I expect a lot, I mean another tomato, perhaps a little pepper and a little lemon.  What I saw was a salad that was absolutely no what I expected at all.  And don't even ge"	1	0
I started new position in March which include a company desk appointment for $200. I had my most recent appointment that was on March 28. It was the end of the 6 week lead time and I had not received an email from them. The next day, I called and they said I needed to fill out an order form (hourly rate) and pay my exam fee ($100). I asked them if it was just for my current appointment and they said it was, and they scheduled it over the next day. They said that I would get an email in two days stating they had my computer in stock and would run my exam and they would call me once they got my computer in.\n\nAt around 10am on Wednesday, March 29, I got an email to say my appointment was on. I put the computer back in my desk and went to start it, only to be turned away. The employee said it was a mistake but they would contact me so I could start the computer. Two days later, I did get an email and got a call from an irate female employee at this office. I explained to her that this office was completely wrong and they would be calling me and actually sending me money. The manager was also extremely nice. She apologized for my experience and she understood the frustration 	1	0
I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to eat here for his wedding. I've been back 2 or 3 times since then, and it's just OK. I'd say we've had 4 different servers. But we've had high hopes.\n\nThe food is mediocre at best. We have bad teeth and can taste the bacteria on our food as soon as we bite into it. We like the fried wontons we get, but the eggrolls are drowning in cabbage and the Japanese eggplant is just not as delicious.\n\nAlso, we had to get menus for every table we brought in, which is ridiculous considering there are only 3 tables of 3. The server didn't seem very eager to help us with anything and we asked a few times before finally getting a server to take us back to the kitchen to get our entrees.\n\nNo thanks, this place is way too good for mediocre food. 	1	0
I was just  visiting Phoenix over the weekend for an architectural conference and was looking for a place to spend the night.  When we were finally able to find some good hostels, this was the one that caught my eye.  A note to the 5 star critics out there.  Avoid this location at all cost.  Not only were the rooms incredibly uncomfortable, but even if you had all the amenities and were able to exercise, they were about $200 a night.  Worse than that, the front desk staff is almost always snooty, and completely uninterested in helping you or your luggage.  These guys can't be trusted to clean your room or take your belongings.\n\nMy fiance and I chose this hotel based on many factors, including:  excellent breakfast location and the fact that the hostels close at 8pm, so I didn't have to worry about finding a place to sleep for the night.  Hotel quality was absolutely top notch, we had a blast for hours, and the location is wonderful.  The rooms are great, and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The hotel is clean and neat and the elevators are located only a few feet from the bathroom.  It's perfect.\n\nNow we're planning on staying here again. 	1	0
Staff is great workout facility is clean and relatively big, great cardio facility with open areas. I've been here for 3 years and am tired of having to come back here to get my high intensity program. The staff has been quick to assist and offer both individual and group sessions. The training can sometimes be intense but you are learning well and feel great. The facilities have been remodeled but so has the equipment and feel. I always enjoy the gym and have never had a reason to leave until now. 	0	1
Update... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay. 	0	1
I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. The pharmacy seems clean. The staff is friendly. The store is very well maintained and the equipment is well maintained. I do miss the Days Inn in Union on Centre. I think this is the last one. 	0	1
The art museum is pretty nice; the carriage and carousel rides are nice. I would have liked to see the actual Old West fight scenes, though. 	0	1
1 star for price and 1 star for atmosphere; however, this dive bar has it all.  All the beer I could think of was drunk, all the food on offer was good and the interior was just great.  It was also quite fun to just sit in the bar with the games, darts and TVs going to a variety of sports.  I think this place can easily accommodate two groups of 20 to 28 who have to leave early.  If you want a real, real dive bar, somewhere that is not overpriced, you have to head on over to Pineville Tavern.  Oh, and thanks for being right here in Pittsburgh! 	0	1
I was in town for two days and our hotel was filthy and needed an update. I took a business partner and he got us our very own room. It had a full bathroom, plenty of comfy pillows, and we even had our own TV! I got out of there wagging my tail so long, you'd think I'm a professional dancer. It was filthy and needed an immediate update. That's when we noticed the bathroom was right next to the 1/2 shower. Weird.\n\nI don't know what they do to clean the bathrooms at college, but the shampoo and conditioner should be front and center. Our towels had spots all over them, the water was running low (looked like our pool water), and there was never a peep out from the rest of the room. \n\nOur room was a beautiful (I love big city hotels with their glass!) with very nice and modern amenities. We shared a king-sized bed, two double beds, a comfy chair, and a big couch. The bed was comfy and didn't feel like it was completely old. There were tons of pillows, pillows, and pillows of pillows everywhere. The sheets were comfy, the shower wasn't filthy, and the toilet was exactly ho	1	0
2nd visit.\n\n1st visit had seafood soup.  A bit heavy on broth but food was good.\n\n2nd visit had steak tartare.  As good as the first visit.\n\nI really wanted to like this place but I can't.  Steak just has zero flavor and steaks in general need some flavor.\n\nWe ordered buffalo chicken appetizer and another steak tartare.  Everything was OK.\n\n1/3 ate there tonight  and it was really not all that great.  I will avoid this joint at all costs.\n\n---Good food and good service. 	1	0
This is the absolute worst place in Downtown Champaign (other than Camelback). I get an average of 3 minutes of wait on a Saturday afternoon, but that's about where I start to get annoyed. I've also seen them once when all the bars are full, and they let you in the lobby (without telling you, no bigger problem than coming in as an OUTSIDE OWNER). They're good about turning it off when people are leaving, but not all the other less tasteful situations...in the last year I have been to Bmore to the first Circle K (you know, the one downtown that isn't named after a former prime minister...?), Mary Kay's, T.C.K., Paul Mitchell's, Sam's Club, Red Lion, and others, to name just a few.  They have a dirty carpet, outside seating, and a bathroom that is SO dirty, it seriously does not belong in a hotel! On Saturday nights the bathroom is usually a disaster, and its always crappy.  I've been there more than once when the bar has been right and the bathroom is run by the same dude that runs their dining room. They could do with getting a little more clean (including their restroom). 	1	0
I was really excited when I saw the menu for my fianc\u00e9's happy hour. I had been considering eating at Art's for a few years, but I always thought the service was slow. But this time, it was so-so. As for the food... It was delicious. 	0	1
