<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and it just tries to be predictable and creative. Sure, some of the bad moments come from falling asleep, there are some cute moments, some great banter between characters, but it just never really engages with any of the characters or the plot.<br /><br />I am really pleased with the scene in which Arnold and Cheetah are in a forest in England with an impassable amount of cabbage. There are so many things wrong with this film that I was bored enough to buy the DVD in advance. It does seem odd for several reasons. The English language is not very easy to pronounce but the songs make it seem to be spoken by voice over. While the movie is creepy and it sounds creepy, I think it just isn't the good kind of scary movie. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is about an overweight doctor who experiments on the sick man and grows fat until the doctor is eaten alive by his drug dealer (not the cops), in a very long shot. The movie starts with them lying on their beds with their hands over their head telling each other that they will lose weight if the "fatties" don\'t keep their neat little jowls dry! A guy and his little sister get into a bar and there is a blonde guy whose jacket is blowing dust on him and is ruining his clothes, so he gets a job at a candy factory and asks one of the girls to sew him up (doesn\'t matter what the color of his skin is...we all hate him). When the blonde guy gets upset about this and sees his little sister being eaten by a scientist, they go out and find a toy to give away to their daughter to show for the day! And another zombie thing that kills lots of people is when the teacher gives him to the girl. So he runs off and catches up to her. And the end credits. We can never really figure out what happens as the zombie zombies come, and do their running back with little bugs and using a ball and gun instead of zombies...So we don\'t have any movies with special effects. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is a mess, and even worse. As with every MST3K episode, there are a few little points left that don\'t add up to anything. First, the ending is overly abrupt. While I don\'t care for "entertaining", I was kind of intrigued by the "name" of it.<br /><br />Second, the sex scenes were embarrassingly poor and the actors looked like they were passing by on video. Perhaps it\'s because they\'re all old and I\'m 21 years old, but overall, it\'s an embarrassing film that should be avoided at all costs. Even the girls were not sexualized in this film. In the book "Dances With Wolves", there\'s a lot of "stepping off" nudity in this movie. Not only that, the scenes were bare and splashed with nothing but blood.<br /><br />Finally, there are no highlights of the movie whatsoever. At least not until the climactic scene in "Court Of Love" that ends "Our Old Friends Are Still Here."<br /><br />It is absolutely ludicrous to compare this comedy to MST3K\'s "Fur Hens" from "Guinea Pig". Both movies have a great social angle, but "Fur Hens" is entirely different. In some ways, FUR HENS is just a parody of MST3K on a much broader level. It\'s full of nudity. In "Gentlemen, Gentlemen, Gentlemen" we are treated to a fake man dying in a bed, though in both films, we see FUR HENS (my favorite) squirming down stairs, just because.<br /><br />Bottom line is: this MST3K flick is horrible, it\'s lighthearted, it\'s one-sided, it\'s a total waste of time, and it\'s essentially just for laughs. All of the above are valid criticisms, but I won\'t waste my time on these categories. I\'ll just describe what I have here.<br /><br />As mentioned before, there are absolutely no funny moments in this film, even the bit where a guy strangles a woman\'s throat is pathetic. The acting and writing are pretty standard, but there are moments where they shouldn\'t be funny, like when the girl is about to pee or a guy (and the movie) stomps on her and it\'s almost entirely his fault (that woman is bleeding, and it\'s all because he tried to "slide his pants u
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is rushed and overspent, and there are more than enough gore. Sure, some of the\'sick music\' is just the beginning of the movie\'s death scenes (before he delivers the deadly stabbing at the end), but what really works in this movie is the accidental and often funny talking of the kids. It\'s cheap, boring, and un-funny at times. There is a strange, sentimental aspect to the movie, where our heroes are now pawns in an elaborate scheme to get stuff for themselves. A murderer is in the money, and his disguise is a favor. The jewelry shop is a device to ease our heroes into a system where everything is foreclosed and beyond. Finally, the clowns look like an old man\'s brother, and the plot\'s villains are curiously corny (the little high school students sometimes steal expensive jewelry, steal from "girl scouts" who collect crappy American Gladiators, and steal their bodies to show a hoot to our hero). The bad ends are brief, and some of the characters seem lost for a while, but the whole thing was good and weird at times. I didn\'t like the ending too much, but it wasn\'t a bad one. The budget for the movie was pretty bad, and I expected more from it. It\'s better than the 40 minute "Nightmare on Elm Street" kind of movie. This one\'s probably better. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is quite weak with a few chuckles but it is already over the edge in terms of its plot. The best part, is when Freddy gets involved in a freak accident. You cant forget to watch the producers making the documentary about this film which fails to have a great deal of action. This film also fails to show any of the action. The film also fails to generate any plot. Sure a lot of people loved Freddy but unfortunately this poor movie really failed to do that. It must be mentioned that many people like Freddy are actually friends of friends of friends and probably would like to watch a sequel to this movie. These are just few examples of how bad this movie is. A video showing how to make a dud is also nice but for the most part the movie can't really convince people how bad this movie is. The only highlight in the movie comes when it comes to the acting, and then some. There is a lot of character bashing, a bit of a death scene, a bit of nudity and basically everything to distract you from the movie. Despite how bad the movie is it is not without its weaknesses. Not only does the film has no story it does not have a decent storyline and there is absolutely nothing to make your brain bleed because there is no dialogue, the film has absolutely nothing to even remotely stand on its own. There are several flaws in the movie that just aren't worth mentioning and I know you don't want to comment on them, but I cannot. There are several sub plot elements that should have been completely explained and have already been explained. These sub elements are the person, the scene and the motive for the person being in the car. It is not clear where the motive is or what other motivations the person could have for going to go to the hospital. There are some dark, sinister parts in the movie and I would like to stress that this does not mean this is all movie. I do find that the only things that could have been done in this movie is made the persons life less enjoyable by having them kill each other. Also it needs to be mentioned that there are actually some blood splatter effects in this movie. In some places the blood splatter effects are done extremely exaggerated. Don't waste your time with this one because I do not recommend it. It is really not worth it. A very small criticism to the film however, is the poor acting. I really don't understand how somebody with a very high credit rating can get involved in this crap. Despite my praise Freddy does not have the actin
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is really shallow and cheap entertainment on so many levels. The scenes with roaches and their corpses has barely been touched. I have seen tons of sci-fi horror movies and what doesn't make sense is that they are all set in space. Any comedy short lived by the producers isn't worth even a 5 minute ride. It is not original or worthwhile at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is directed by James Davies and appeared in the Naturals around the same time period and it seems that Davies was dubbed to act very well because he felt that he was on his own; so Davies and director Kelly Henson tried to make a great movie, but the negatives are so easy to dismiss that there really isn't much choice. The movie is thoroughly predictable and there isn't any atmosphere of suspense or suspense of the kind usually found in movies. There is also some very bleak, bad acting, and the use of the old school English language sounds very like the way the naturals used to say these lines to remind us of how it could actually be done...The cinematography is very old, possibly some old fashioned. I found it hard to believe that what Davies did was making use of old film-making techniques, but it was nonetheless good to see him making his impression on both the older and younger viewers. Director Davies does use a lot of different techniques, and this is exactly the style he used to create this weak mess of a film. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is so poorly made and produced that we feel that we must leave out an entirely unnecessary and unimaginative introduction. The movie is so poorly shot that even the incredible movie editing, visual effects and ending are completely wasted. The storyline can't possibly be played out and it is truly unpleasant to watch. While the movie's one leading man is a really good movie actor who is not totally evil, the plot somehow gets twisted so that it has nothing to do with his character. The beginning and end of the movie are terribly contrived. The ending of this movie, by showing how your character will be killed in a supernatural episode, just seems incredibly unfunny.<br /><br />If you are a fan of supernatural movies, even the most focused and intelligent will tell you that this is an extremely bad movie, one that will leave you emotionally numb. But unless you are in a state of dread, you should just skip it.<br /><br />Stay away from this garbage. It does not deserve an ending that is even remotely scary. Not even a decent one. This is a VERY bad movie and should not be even considered for a DVD release. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is crap. A porno. Boring, plain boring. It seems to me that the whole concept is a pretentious attempt to be funny. I wish they were more serious in their choice of scenes, but they chose to go straight to the bloody whorehouse (as if that's remotely funny). The scenery sucks. The storyline is pathetic. The writing is poor. The cinematography is appalling. My only problem is that the whole thing fails to amuse me. So far the movie has not improved. 
<|startoftext|> [negative] <|sep|> The movie is long; and those who are like me are about as tired of it.<br /><br />The main problem is that most of the acting is, well, just plain silly. In the end, they create nothing worthwhile. They are essentially cartoonish caricatures. Oh, wait, they even tried to include many of the 'funny' parts...<br /><br />There are two passages of dialogue in the film that go by extremely fast. One is in an angry blackface scene, the other in a montage of a beautiful style, such as the music in this scene. The montage looks like a scene from a fairy tale...that is, a very polished period piece. (That said, it is some of the funniest of the movies.)<br /><br />I think the director just didn't have enough room on his hands. He could have done a more effective job, but he just didn't. In this movie, whenever it is set, you can still look at all the scenes and find them funny. The producers (I remember this movie in my hometown), shouldn't have made a movie that is truly funny and heart-warming. It just isn't...that's just not the case in the movie.
